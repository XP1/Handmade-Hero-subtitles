00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,300
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,400
The show we could a complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We just got done with a little fur, coat or Friday, so we're starting

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,800
a little late today.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,000
We're starting it like, 422 we instead of starting at 5:00, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
522 instead of starting at 5:00.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,400
So, you know, sometimes you're late in software development.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,700
Things start late.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,300
They end even later, it's always a disaster.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,400
That's just how things go.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,000
That's just how things go.

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,299
But we have some code to do today that we need to do.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,300
Um, basically we played around yesterday and smushed our debug you I

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,200
systems together.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
Because we had some like hockey stuff.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,600
We were doing the profile before we kind of put it in there and so

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
today I'm not sure exactly what we're going to do.

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,900
I think what I'd like to do is I'd like to clean up a few things in it

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,600
since it's Friday.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
I don't really want to go too far down getting the profile interface

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,700
working because I think what tomorrow?

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,000
I mean what next week should be about is getting some clean interfaces

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
for like the profiling, for switching things and stuff like that.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
So what I'd like to do today is clean up a few things.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,400
I'd like to clean up the way that we're doing our, debug trees a

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,900
little bit.

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,000
And there are the where interface

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,700
He's done a little bit so that we can have a few more advanced

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,300
features in there.

30
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,200
And so that things are running a little bit more smoothly.

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,700
So we're going to like, do some Cleanup in some feature addition

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,500
today, rather than focusing on, you know, sort of what I think is more

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,900
of an almost, a design problem, because honestly, I don't really know.

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
And I mean, like a ux is a problem, I don't really know.

35
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,900
I've never built a super capable profiler before.

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,200
I've only just had like, little readouts of like times.

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,300
And now that we have like, all this data about, like, when threads are

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,500
doing what and all this stuff, I haven't really ever given a thought

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,000
to like,

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,000
What should I actually, how do I make that something that's usable and

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
so next week, I think, you know, will be us, figuring that sort of

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,400
stuff out like, like, how can we make that a really nice little thing

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,600
to, we can view and use.

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,400
All right, I'm going to just go ahead and Jump Right In Here.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Today is day.

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,100
1 98 day, 197 source.

47
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Code is what I'm starting with today.

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,400
So if you pre-order the game at hand be here at dot org, you need to

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,100
start with de 197 source.

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,700
Code don't start with some other day source code because you'll be

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
like, what's going on, start with 197.

52
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,600
Because that's when I'm starting with right now and you can see where

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,000
we were at is pretty cool.

54
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,600
You can go in here and you can edit these things where we just have

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,600
like all these kind of weird, you know, test things that we put in

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,300
there and

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,100
whatever they were, you know, could edit them.

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,500
And you could do stuff like this, where you could like change values

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
by like dragging and all that sort of stuff.

60
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,200
And you could also do things where, if you wanted to, you could open

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,900
up like a the profiler and it would show things like the, you know,

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,800
the whole profile or data inside here and you could even, like, change

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
the size of the profiler, right?

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,900
So, we had like the ability to like, you know, kind of drag things

65
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,800
around and you can kind of see it there.

66
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,700
And you can see us taking too long because our debug collation kind of

67
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,100
shoots right over the edge there.

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Oops.

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,800
You know what?

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,300
Can you say?

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,200
Yeah, so we took a little too long.

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,500
We took a little too long, you know, are bad anyway, so you know,

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,700
we've got that sort of stuff here and you can see that you can have

74
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,200
multiple of them and all that other good stuff, right?

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,500
And everything kind of response dynamically and it's all nice and

76
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,700
easy.

77
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,700
And again you know we're not trying to make a professional.

78
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,300
You I hear anything like that but I am trying to show how easy it is.

79
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,000
It's only been a few hours on the actual UI stuff, right?

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm just trying to show how easy it is that you can make some

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
interactable things.

82
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
You don't have to link some

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
gigantic UI Library into your game or anything.

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,700
You can trivially have some perfectly usable.

85
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,000
Debug you I in in only just a few lines of code really and so that's

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,900
kind of a nice thing.

87
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,800
All right, so what I'd like to do now, the first thing I like to do is

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,300
I want to make it so we can just tear off pieces of this thing.

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,600
So for example, if I'm in the debugging thing and I have this, this by

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,800
thread thing here, I want to be able to like grab it, you know.

91
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
And you can see like, right now, the only thing that'll do is it'll

92
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
just like turn on and off.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
What I want to be able to do is like grab this thing and drag it out

94
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,100
here and have like that that profiler or whatever it is.

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,300
I want to have that thing through like sort of like throw up a little,

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,300
you know, separate debug list or whatever, you know.

97
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,600
So, you know, just just something that allows me to do.

98
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,100
That kind of operation.

99
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,200
And again it's really not that hard to do something like that.

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
So I just kind of wanted to show how easy it is to make some things

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
that are that can have that kind of capability.

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,700
Alright, so here we go.

103
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,200
So here we are in handmade debug, you can see it here.

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,800
And the way that we've got our stuff structured is we have these debug

105
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,300
variable groups and then we have these debug variables and what you

106
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,600
can see here is that a debug variable itself, actually stores.

107
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,700
The data that it's trying to edit, right?

108
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,600
It's the, it is the actual debug variable.

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,300
And the problem with that is it means that it's hard for us to put a

110
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,500
debug variable in more than one place.

111
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
Ace, right?

112
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,800
What we would much rather do is have this be in directed in some way

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,900
because we'd like to be able to have every debug variable be

114
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,300
referenceable from multiple places at once.

115
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,900
So the only thing I really need to do to have that is just to have an

116
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,800
in directed list.

117
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Now we've talked about these before but we don't really ever use them

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,500
in my recollection in handmade hero because Dudley and directed list,

119
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,000
just aren't that common in games, we probably will see some little bit

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,500
later it when we're talking about things that are more like you know,

121
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,300
maybe like this guy.

122
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Is like, chasing some people and their double, you know, who knows

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,900
there's going to be some things for doing the heaven but just we just

124
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,200
have not really had much use for them and they're a lot less common in

125
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,100
things like games than they are in something like an editor where

126
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,600
you're going to have more of that happening.

127
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,000
But either way, they're extremely easy, right?

128
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,800
All we have to do is introduce some secondary structure that instead

129
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
will keep what, you know will capture.

130
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,900
The linkage part of things and that linkage part will be separate from

131
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,300
the variable itself, right?

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,500
so now,

133
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Whatever this thing actually is right.

134
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,800
We won't have to actually worry about about how many people want to

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,500
use it.

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,900
They will always just sort of be able to keep creating these new debug

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,100
variable references inside their hierarchies.

138
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,000
And you know, well they'll just be able to yeah they'll just be able

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to keep on referencing and referencing and referencing and referencing

140
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
as much as they want.

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,800
And because the rest of this stuff

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
All just, you know, what you would expect.

143
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,600
Then all we really have to do is change anyone who is actually going

144
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,300
to be using one of these things, right?

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,000
To actually point to a reference instead of of an actual variable,

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,600
right?

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,300
So, for example, here, where we've got a group that's holding a bunch

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,500
of things, what we want.

149
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Now, want to do, is, instead of making that group actually hold debug

150
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,400
variable chains.

151
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,700
We just want to hold reference chains, right?

152
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,100
And similarly, when we have a debug variable hierarchy,

153
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,700
Excuse me.

154
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,200
What we'd want to do, there is have that hierarchy basically take some

155
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
kind of a reference as well.

156
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Now, I don't know.

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,000
when I think I'm kind of thinking about it here,

158
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,200
I feel like probably the debug variable hierarchy thing should

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,700
probably do something slightly different.

160
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,300
So I want to hold off on modifying that because I think we might want

161
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,500
to do something slightly different there.

162
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,400
So, for now, let me just, I'm just going to do the work necessary to

163
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Port this, over to having, debug variable references, be things that

164
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,700
are kind of process dynamically in that way, right?

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Alright, so here we go.

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,300
We've got our debug variable reference stuff.

167
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,900
I should probably make this defined up there so it can refer

168
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,700
Here we go.

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,300
And then you here when we do debug, add variable, what we want to do

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,900
now is essentially just make both things here because this is still

171
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,900
used generally to create, you know, sort of a referencing sort of a

172
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,400
scheme.

173
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make

174
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,500
A debug variable thing here which is, which is like debug add, you

175
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,400
know, fun reference variable in case we want to ever do that

176
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,299
specifically.

177
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,299
And that will do just the part of this that does not involve the the

178
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,299
grouping, right?

179
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,200
So basically this part and then what we'll do is we'll say, okay,

180
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
we'll create the variable.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,900
There we go.

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,900
And then we will also Jimmy once we create the variable, we will also

183
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,600
create a debug variable.

184
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,700
So do you add variable reference context type?

185
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,100
Well, we don't need type all I think we really need is context and

186
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,600
probably the variable, right?

187
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,900
And then in here, we'll just do debug variable reference

188
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,800
and the debug variable reference will just do this part.

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,100
You know that we saw before, right?

190
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,100
And this presumably will return a debug variable reference.

191
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,200
Well actually, I guess, I don't know which one it would have to

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,600
return.

193
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,800
I think you probably want it to return the variable reference because

194
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
the variable reference could get to the variable, but the variable

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,000
can't get to the reference, right?

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,400
So do it that way.

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,700
All right.

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah so in here what we would need for our debug variable reference,

199
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,500
we just need something that actually points the debug variable and

200
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,100
there it is.

201
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,200
And so when we create this debug variable reference, let's go ahead

202
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,100
and put that in there.

203
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,200
Again, really nothing.

204
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Particularly interesting going on here.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
Debug variable.

206
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,300
VAR.

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,000
And so when you know we're just going to do the exact same thing we

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
did before we're going to get another one of these guys.

209
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,100
Do you like variable reference we're going to push the debug variable

210
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,400
reference on to the arena.

211
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,800
We're going to go ahead and set the reference so that it's a variable

212
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
points to the variable that we were given and then all the rest of

213
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,200
these things that we used to do groupwise, they're all going to be

214
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,500
talking about the reference now instead of talking about the variable,

215
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
but that's about it, right?

216
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,000
Not a lot else going on there.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,700
So, that's all we need to do there.

218
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,300
Now, on the parent front, again I think the parent front wants to be

219
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
doing references as well.

220
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,200
So so basically like when you look at this thing, we want to we want

221
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,500
our trees are cut the trees.

222
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
We construct.

223
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,500
I think always want to be references so we can have arbitrary trees in

224
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,600
the variables underneath will just be you know specific things or

225
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,000
whatever.

226
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,900
Right?

227
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
And so if we have that we need this to be a variable reference like

228
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,100
so.

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
And this right here would need to be

230
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Of a reference like so.

231
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,100
And then if we move down, when we're talking about like the group cure

232
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,500
or whatever, we're actually going to talk about the group VAR, right?

233
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,600
Because now the group like is always sort of an indirect pointer

234
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,900
there.

235
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,000
And, you know, if we want to I suppose we could also do it this way

236
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,600
where we just say you know, we've got context group and you know, if

237
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,900
the group itself

238
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,300
We could also do something like this group ref.

239
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,600
In fact, I could do it like this.

240
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,000
Right, ref parent.

241
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,800
And then I can do something like, you know, here's the group.

242
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,200
And if the ref parent is not zero,

243
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,500
Oops, then we'll go ahead and grab that ref parent variable out.

244
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,700
Right.

245
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,700
So there we go.

246
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,000
All right in here in here.

247
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,500
It thinks it cannot convert something to a variable reference.

248
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
Now, why would that be?

249
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,500
Oh, that's because I forgot a pointer there.

250
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,600
That's no good.

251
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,400
Oops, let's try that again.

252
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,100
Debug add variable cannot convert from variable reference.

253
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,500
Okay.

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,200
So that's fine.

255
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,300
Where we begin variable group that will just do this.

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
Excuse me.

257
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,200
That's all really simple.

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,400
Nothing really to do there.

259
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
When we return groups, right?

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,600
This should return a reference as well and debug add variable same

261
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,200
thing here.

262
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,300
This is going to be reference.

263
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,700
This is going to be VAR this election year FR.

264
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,200
These are all rest now and I assume diesel are going to be something

265
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
like this, right?

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,700
Yeah, and again, all I'm really doing nothing.

267
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,300
Particularly unusual here, just really basic stuff.

268
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm just changing it to that.

269
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,000
These things are kind of doubly directed and that just allows me to

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,600
have the superstructure stored in something other than the data is

271
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,100
stored in.

272
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,400
And it's just a really, really basic transformation.

273
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,800
It's a little bit of typing, but it doesn't really, you know, nothing.

274
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,200
Nothing momentous is happening.

275
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,600
It's really just pretty boring, pretty milquetoast, pretty

276
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
milquetoast.

277
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,800
And so yes.

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's about it.

279
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,800
These guys obviously are returning references now and so they kind of

280
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
have to go through that VAR and direction.

281
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,900
And again, this is debug code.

282
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,200
So we don't care about the in directions, either, we don't really care

283
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,900
at all about this stuff.

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,200
If it's performance was bad, we just buy a faster dead machine.

285
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,100
No users ever.

286
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,900
Have to run it.

287
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,500
So it only matters if it works, and it's convenient for us to

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,800
implement and hopefully it will be both of those things, although

289
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
sometimes you never do.

290
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,400
No.

291
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:11,800
All right.

292
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Let's keep going.

293
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,800
So now, we want to go ahead and propagate this change out.

294
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
One level up, which is to say that the route group structure that

295
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,500
these people are working.

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,800
With, we really want to have a debug variable reference there.

297
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,700
And so, the hierarchy group, I guess I said I wasn't going to do it

298
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,100
yet, but I guess I will actually do it because, hey, we might as well

299
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,200
propagate it out and then I'll fix it in a second.

300
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,900
So then we have when we're writing our stuff out, when we do our route

301
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,200
groups.

302
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,300
Now we're going to want to look at vars here, right?

303
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,500
Like so, and these are not vars.

304
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,800
Really, these are refs.

305
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,800
And so we'll have debug variable bar equals ref.

306
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Bar then all this stuff should work.

307
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,200
Basically the same, the only difference now is that the end

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,800
We do stuff.

309
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,100
The we're going to set the ref, not the VAR, right?

311
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,700
So we're really just working off of refs here because we're iterating

312
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
over the rest of the bars are.

313
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:17,800
Just this kind of like thing that we're looking into underneath that

314
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,300
make sense.

315
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,700
Okay.

316
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,600
Yeah.

317
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,300
And so we're going to have to do like I said, we're going to do

318
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,500
another round of lofting a second, but that's okay.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
So, let's just go ahead and finish this up.

320
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,700
So in here again, we've got that hark a group thing so that's going to

321
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,600
have to access inside.

322
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,300
What are you complaining about, mr.

323
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Right, we go and let's see.

324
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Do we say hot equals far?

325
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,700
So this is actually a good guy said again, ref.

326
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,600
And then we have a debug variable VAR which is going to be the ref bar

327
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
and then we just have to fix our iterators.

328
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Like I said before, we're iterating on ref now.

329
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,900
So this stuff just works like this.

330
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,100
Right.

331
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:14,900
Okay.

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,300
So I think that's it.

333
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,400
And in theory, this should still work relatively similarly to the way

334
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,200
it does before modulo any errors.

335
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,400
That we may have made, but it looks like it's pretty good, right?

336
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,900
We're still able to iterate over our things and all that stuff is

337
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,300
fine, right?

338
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
So that all seems pretty good.

339
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,800
So let's go ahead and check now.

340
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Now that we have those variable references.

341
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,100
Let's see if we can do something where we take, you know, a

342
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,100
particular, debug variable and we add it into two different groups,

343
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,100
right?

344
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,500
Just to test that ability to make sure that we've actually done it.

345
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,000
Right.

346
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,700
So now, you know, let's say we've got something that we have here,

347
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,000
like, debug camera distance.

348
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,900
I want to go ahead and add that outside.

349
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,900
I'm going to say that.

350
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,700
I have a debug variable reference here.

351
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,400
That's the debug cam.

352
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Use debug camera for something like that.

353
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,200
That use debug camera F.

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,900
When I do my debug variable listing, I'm going to grab it.

355
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,200
I don't know if I can actually do that with the macro.

356
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,800
I think I can.

357
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,300
Yeah, I can.

358
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,800
And so, when I come out here, what I want to do is I want to go ahead

359
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,400
and add a variable at the very end.

360
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,700
It's going to shadow that variable, they're going to be the same

361
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
variable, right?

362
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,500
So what I would do there is I'd say, use debug, cam ref.

363
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,200
I want to add like a few.

364
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,700
Oops, let me do that and made debug variables.

365
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,800
I want to go ahead and add that guy in.

366
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
So, what I want to do here is just debug add vertical reference like

367
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,100
so and debug, add variable reference will take the context and then I

368
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,300
can add this variable again.

369
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
So I'm just going to take that variable that I added before.

370
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm going to add it again, right there, right.

371
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,100
Oops, and got it.

372
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,800
Get rid of that parent, add, that's there.

373
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
So now when I run, you know, if I open this up, you can see that I've

374
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,700
got used the about camera here which didn't used to be here, and it's

375
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
the same use debug camera.

376
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
That's right here.

377
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,300
And in fact, you can even see that when I Mouse over them now, they

378
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
both highlight because they're the same variable, and I'm testing for

379
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,400
highlighting.

380
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,300
I'm testing variable Miss and when I change them, they both change and

381
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,500
I can change them in either place, right?

382
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,900
And again, that's all I really wanted to do there.

383
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,600
I wanted to make it.

384
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,400
So there was no penalty for having things in more than one place

385
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000
because I'm a

386
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,400
To have things in more than one place.

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,700
And now I do, right?

388
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,900
So, that's good.

389
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,700
Okay.

390
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:57,300
Alright, so now we're going to need some more memory gonna need some

391
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,100
more memory.

392
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,900
So one of the things that we do here is we take like all the memory

393
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,400
that we have are allowed to use for our debug system.

394
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,100
Which means that if I wanted to make more stuff, I wouldn't be able to

395
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,200
do.

396
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,800
So right there would be no way for me to actually make a new menu.

397
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,200
If I was going to tear one off, there would be no way to actually do

398
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,700
that, which is kind of, which is a villa bit, it's bad.

399
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,900
So that poop sauce, right?

400
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,600
And so, you can see where that's actually happening, right?

401
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,900
We have the, the debug start thing.

402
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,200
And up here, you can see me initialize this Arena like this.

403
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,800
You can see me, sort of like getting the, the size that do big arena.

404
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,700
And then I come down through here, we do like allocate render group,

405
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,800
we do all these sorts of things.

406
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,000
When we do the restart collation from not very much an error, we then

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
go ahead and take that collation Arena.

408
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,600
And yeah, that's the thing that we actually use to do all of our debug

409
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,500
scratch work.

410
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
And so,

411
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,700
Let's take a look at that, so when we do that sub Arena, oh, I'm a

412
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,200
liar.

413
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,800
We don't use all the memory.

414
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,500
Okay, so we still did leave some memory for use in stuff like this so

415
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,200
that's good.

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,800
All right, so when we want to we should be able to just go ahead and

417
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,500
make more of these anytime we want.

418
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,700
And that's pretty sweet.

419
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,400
I like that that makes me happy camper.

420
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,800
So if I want to do

421
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
All of this stuff.

422
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,300
All I really need to do now is make some way for me to have more, you

423
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
know, more than one of these debug variable hierarchies, right?

424
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,400
Because the debug variable, hierarchy is the thing that controls what

425
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,000
is drawn.

426
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,600
And right now, I can only have one of them when we called Drake draw,

427
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,000
debug menu, you can see that I can only draw one debug hierarchy.

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,800
It's like hard-coded to be that one.

429
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,500
So what I'd rather do is make it so that I can draw like as many debug

430
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,400
car keys as I want, right?

431
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
I'd rather have something that's just a for Loop here that

432
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Draws debug hierarchies, like you know, and just keep stirring them in

433
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,700
drawing the drawing, the drawing them.

434
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,100
You know I'm saying?

435
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,500
Something like that.

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
And this debug State at why thing.

437
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,000
That's a bit of a janky thing as well.

438
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,700
Because, you know, that's just it means, it'll depend, we need like a

439
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,200
cut more of a, you know, a concept of where that stuff is going to go.

440
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,100
We have those sort of things are just like the little command line

441
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,800
compiling thing and that kind of stuff.

442
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,700
We need a better sense of where those goes because we these are now

443
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,700
these floating menu things and there's no such there's no real sense

444
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,100
of like, where things would get appended.

445
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,800
So, there's a bunch of things we need to do for that.

446
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,000
So just ignore that for now.

447
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Forget about that stuff.

448
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
We don't care about that at all.

449
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:38,600
We're going.

450
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,700
Back around to it and just pluck it out, just give it a little pluck

451
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,000
with some Zircon.

452
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,900
Encrusted tweezers.

453
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,800
We're just going to reach in there and just grab it.

454
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,600
All right.

455
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
So we need to do here, we need to Loop over some of these things.

456
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,500
So I want something like, you know, hierarchy equals, you know debug

457
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
stayed first hierarchy or something.

458
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Ridiculous.

459
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,900
Like that, I don't even know like this, or maybe there's a hierarchy

460
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,100
Sentinel, I don't even know hierarchies Sentinel or something like

461
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:10,600
this.

462
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,900
And I just want to go until hierarchy Sentinel next or something like

463
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,300
that.

464
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:23,500
Yeah so there's you know debug variable Harkey next or previous

465
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,600
something like that and so when the hierarchy is not equal to the

466
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,100
central anymore I'm just going to Loop through it.

467
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,300
And that would allow me to just have like some arbitrary number of

468
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,600
those.

469
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,400
And then when we actually talked about the hierarchy itself, we would

470
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
actually just grab whatever Harkey we want.

471
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,700
And that means we can have as many of those things, you know, floating

472
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,300
around, as we want to have floating around, they can just float float,

473
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,400
and float and Float all day long and no one will care.

474
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,600
No, I'm saying to you.

475
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,100
Getting be allergy season, man.

476
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
There's gonna be some stuffy noses.

477
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,900
So buckle up

478
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Alright so here's here's that list, you know, iteration that I want to

479
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,700
have happen.

480
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,300
So all I have to do if I want that literally serration to happen, is I

481
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,900
have to actually just go implement it.

482
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,100
So now, our hierarchy is actually going to become the hierarchy

483
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,700
Sentinel

484
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,500
Like this.

485
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,800
And when I recompile everything will break and then I can fix it

486
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,600
because, you know, I'm just gonna do some fixing of it.

487
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,100
Never mind.

488
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,600
So when I go ahead and add that hierarchy function here, which is the

489
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,100
thinks we're gonna want, we're going to want to add our route group.

490
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
So we just want to do something that's going to like put the hierarchy

491
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,100
we already had in, is the only hierarchy, right?

492
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,200
So we're going to want something called add hierarchy, that's going to

493
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,300
do that for us because that's, you know, pretty obvious.

494
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,800
And we just tell it, where are we?

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,900
To go and then we tell it, you know like what the route group was

496
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,600
presumably, it would return to us with the hierarchy was you know

497
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,300
that's it.

498
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,100
Nothing fancy and then let's see what else it would complain about.

499
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,700
Yeah I know you don't have ad hierarchy so in here cannot convert ok

500
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,900
so I don't even take an address there I don't know why I thought I did

501
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,000
that was just kind of stupid.

502
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,400
Alright and so this is just going to be pointers because it wasn't a

503
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,200
pointer before.

504
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,000
Now it is pointers and yeah I think that's it.

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,900
So as long as we have a function called add a hierarchy that would

506
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,800
give us what we want.

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,100
Ain't nothing particularly weird about that, it's just we've seen me

508
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,600
do it a million times again.

509
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,500
This is the thing about not having metaprogramming.

510
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,200
I hate templates and I refuse to use them.

511
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,600
So I am happy to like code my own linked lists by hand when I need

512
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,000
them.

513
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,600
Normally work, I just met a code them.

514
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,400
But if I don't have them, I just type them in because I find that that

515
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,600
like actually works and trying to use templates, never does.

516
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,700
It's always a disaster and then you just have the iso C++ committee

517
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,500
squatting on you the whole time and it's awful.

518
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,800
So anyway, let's go ahead and go ahead and get a debug variable

519
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,500
reference in here.

520
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,100
Debug variable reference

521
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,500
and,

522
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,400
P the location where it's going to be.

523
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,100
So that's what I want.

524
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,000
I just need to get one of these so I can push struct into the debugger

525
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,300
Arena pretty easily.

526
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Right?

527
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,900
So I can make a new one of these.

528
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,800
Where I just say like, okay, here's my debug variable hierarchy, my

529
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,100
new one, right?

530
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,100
like so and when I grabbed this hierarchy out debug variable

531
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,700
hierarchy,

532
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,600
I just need to initialize the stuff that's in it, so the UI p is going

533
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
to be at P.

534
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,400
The group is going to be the route group or I shouldn't even say root

535
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,300
group anymore because it's just group, it happens through the roof

536
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,500
group.

537
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,000
The first time I call it but that's it.

538
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:00,200
The next and the previous are just going to be again, standard doubly

539
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,100
linked list here.

540
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
It takes 10 seconds, Implement right?

541
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
You've got the hierarchy Sentinel.

542
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,900
Like so, so the previous pointer going to insert this at the head end

543
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,800
to the previous guy is going to be the sensible itself but whoever the

544
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,500
Sentinels next pointer was is going to be our next pointer and then we

545
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,800
just need to fix up the other pointers, right?

546
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So at that point, we know that whoever is next.

547
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Whoever is the person that comes after us their previous pointer

548
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
should point to us and whoever came before us their next pointer,

549
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
should point to us, right?

550
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,700
And that's about all there is to it, so then we finally probably want

551
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,900
to make sure that we actually returned this so that anyone who's

552
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,200
trying to do something with it.

553
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,900
After it's been added.

554
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,400
Excuse me, have barbecue for lunch, man.

555
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,000
It was crazy.

556
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,000
It's too much food.

557
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,800
All right.

558
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,500
So let's see.

559
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,900
Here we go.

560
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,000
Ahead and we do our push struct.

561
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,600
That seems like it's corrupt.

562
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,800
That's should be an address for

563
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,200
Way.

564
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,500
Huh.

565
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,000
Let's see.

566
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
Do not have an overloaded operator.

567
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,900
That is correct.

568
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
It does not have an overloaded operator.

569
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,100
I agree with you and that should be a pointer.

570
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay, so that adds something our Sentinel to the list there.

571
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,800
And I think I don't remember if I wrote The Loop code there, I don't

572
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,800
think that I did.

573
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,100
So that's probably a little bit of an issue.

574
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,700
I also don't know if I have to clear out those pointers to point to

575
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,000
each other at the outset and so I just have to make sure that all that

576
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
stuff is kosher at

577
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
Start up and then I think we should be fine.

578
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,900
So when we create our context here, here it is, right?

579
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,100
We get our debug state.

580
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,800
I can just make that hierarchy, let's see where it is.

581
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,600
So we've got the next equals.

582
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
The hierarchy itself.

583
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,400
Again, I'm just standard doubly linked list, making the list start out

584
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
pointing The Sentinel point to itself.

585
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,300
So it's an empty list.

586
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,100
And I'm also going to go ahead and make that group pointer point to

587
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
zero, just to make sure that everyone knows that.

588
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,400
If you try to iterate over it, you would be very unhappy and things

589
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,800
would go horribly wrong for you.

590
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,200
So don't do that.

591
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,400
And let's see.

592
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,400
So I think that's the only thing I had left to implement on the linked

593
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
list but I can't quite remember.

594
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,900
Let's see.

595
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,800
Looks like we are drawing that multiple times that if I'm not

596
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,400
mistaken.

597
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,400
So I feel like we are not exiting out of our Loop.

598
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,900
Quite right?

599
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,100
Let me double-check that my for Loop.

600
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,200
There it is.

601
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Right?

602
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Okay, so in the debug car key, we go through the next one.

603
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,500
We Loop over it until we are.

604
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Done with that.

605
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,000
And let me check my Harkey ad ad Harkey.

606
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,200
That looks correct and the previous points back to the hockey Sentinel

607
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,400
itself, that all looks good and the hierarchy, the next previous

608
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,300
points back to me and the previous/next for expect to me.

609
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Okay, so that's good.

610
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,800
But it does look like we're doing multiple times.

611
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,000
So I'm going to grab the stuff in there to the draw main menu or what

612
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,200
is it?

613
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,100
Debug grub main menu.

614
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,800
Debug, where is that draw?

615
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Main menu thing?

616
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,200
There it is, draw debug menu, that's what it's called.

617
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
Somehow we, you know what?

618
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,300
You know what the fudge man?

619
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,600
What the fudge?

620
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,800
Alright, debug draw menu.

621
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,600
Names.

622
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,000
At least a little bit more consistent.

623
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,900
Okay.

624
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,500
So my step into debug Drummond you they're actually going to do at

625
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,200
hierarchy.

626
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,700
Okay, and so let's just make sure everything is kosher here.

627
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
And yeah.

628
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,200
Actually wanted to look at that Sentinel RQ.

629
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Sentinel next, there is my next guy.

630
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,300
So here's me which is no and here's my next guy and then the next one

631
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,500
points back to the Sentinel.

632
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,200
So that's good.

633
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,400
That's exactly what I wanted that all looks nice and then let's go

634
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,800
ahead and continue on.

635
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,300
Or try to continue on, where is my drug debug menu?

636
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,900
Oops, that's handmaids.

637
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,500
That's not actually where I don't want to be in handmade.

638
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,800
I'll see the PO me, he made debug, there we go.

639
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
And so here I should have my drum and you function.

640
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,200
And of course, there it is debug menu.

641
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,400
And so if I come through here, I should be drawing the hierarchy

642
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,600
hierarchy.

643
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,700
There we go.

644
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,900
So that's good.

645
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,100
And there's our debug variable group as well.

646
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,800
So I come through here and this thing does all of its drawing fun and

647
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,900
that's all good.

648
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,200
And then it should just kind of blessed bust out of there.

649
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,600
And then when I come through here, well, I exit it out.

650
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,200
So that seems totally correct.

651
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,500
Actually and I'm not really sure what the problem is.

652
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,600
You know what the problem is?

653
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,800
I bet add hierarchy, I bet I'm calling that in the yeah.

654
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,200
Nice, that's pretty stupid.

655
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,300
You got to admit.

656
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
It's pretty stupid.

657
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,900
I was calling that once a frame, that's going to be a lot of

658
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,700
hierarchies and a lot of drawing.

659
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,600
So let's not do that.

660
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,200
Question though, how will we know where to put this hierarchy?

661
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,700
When we do not actually know how big things are.

662
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,700
I guess we probably do actually know how big they are because we could

663
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,900
calculate this stuff ahead of time I suppose, right?

664
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,700
Like we would know what these things are, I suppose?

665
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,200
So if we want to, we could probably do, we can probably do that stuff,

666
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,300
right?

667
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,400
So, we could probably start out putting it at like that and

668
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,100
We could start out with this guy being, you know, at 0.5 times height.

669
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Okay.

670
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,500
So now I think we're in better shape, right?

671
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Everything seems pretty good there, everything is happy and smiling.

672
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
And so let's go ahead and make it so that we can tear things off of

673
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,900
here.

674
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,600
Which again is something that I said I wanted to do.

675
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,800
So if I want to be able to tear things off of here, what I'm going to

676
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,700
do for that is we have that sort of interaction concept here.

677
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,900
what I'm going to do is

678
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Had a new interaction concept.

679
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
And that interaction concept is going to allow you to Terror groups

680
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,900
off and put them in other places.

681
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,500
So okay, if I was going to do that, what I'd like to do is go ahead

682
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,900
and introduce some kind of a little thing here into my interactions

683
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,600
type.

684
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,800
And so, what I'm going to do is I guess I've got this tear value

685
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,300
thing, right.

686
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,100
And

687
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,200
So I feel like probably the easiest thing to do would just be to put a

688
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,400
little thing that I could tear that I could use to tear stuff off of.

689
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,100
We'll try that first, we'll see.

690
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,200
But what I'm going to do before anything else is I'm going to make it

691
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,100
so that the toggle value thing, I'm just gonna make it.

692
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,000
So it always tears and then we'll have a way to do the tearing

693
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,400
separately.

694
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,300
So I'm going to go into toggle value here.

695
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,500
And say, when we do debug begin about, you know what, why am I just

696
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,100
what I do?

697
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,800
It just like, stop, like blabber.

698
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,500
At it and just go just do it, it take you longer to do it.

699
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,300
Then it would, it's like, say all this stuff.

700
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,800
So, anyway, when I do the push wrecked, you saw me before do this

701
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
where I put a size box in here.

702
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,500
Right.

703
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,699
And so what I could do instead like with other stuff is I could go

704
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,000
ahead and make it so that everything has like a little tear off thingy

705
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,900
like thing and so I'm just going to do that because why not right and

706
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,400
so to do that I would just do the exact same thing I did here, right?

707
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,199
I just do this.

708
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:30,800
Oops.

709
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,300
You know I'm saying where I basically just have like okay so there's a

710
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,900
tear box or something like this and the terror box would just be

711
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,000
something that we put that allows you to like grab the thing and like

712
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
put it somewhere else, you know.

713
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,400
Or something like that, right?

714
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,199
And you know, you could even do something fancier than that.

715
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,400
If you wanted to you could make it the like if you if you if you you

716
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,400
know had a modifier key held down or something like that, I don't

717
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,500
know.

718
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
But for right now I'm just going to do it this way or you know what?

719
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,300
No, I'm not gonna do it that way.

720
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,900
Let's just do it this way.

721
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,300
Let's say we have debug interaction none, but if we are in some

722
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,200
situation,

723
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,700
Where we actually do have some kind of extra input thing happening.

724
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,900
Some kind of, you know, something else happening.

725
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Then we will do, do the chair right.

726
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,300
You know, something like this, like, you know, be 32 all you I right?

727
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,100
And so in here, there's like some kind of all you I think where we

728
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,100
just say like okay if you had whatever the all UI thing is down, then

729
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,000
it's going to be at are operation otherwise it's going to be an

730
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,700
operation, right?

731
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,900
Something like that.

732
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,500
Does that seem fair?

733
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
And maybe these guys work the same way as well.

734
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,500
I don't know, maybe will formalize that later.

735
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,300
I'm not sure.

736
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,900
But something like this and then when we isn't anything tear value,

737
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,200
Okay.

738
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,500
And then, you know, in here, what we'll do is, we'll just say, I don't

739
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,500
know, like, whatever is supposed to be happening, is happening.

740
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,500
If you have the something ALT key down to these, do the modifiers.

741
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
Do we have modifiers on here?

742
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,900
I don't even remember Mouse button Mouse buttons.

743
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
So we don't seem to have any modifiers, but we could actually add

744
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,300
those pretty easily, right?

745
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
We could add a modifier key and they're pretty trivially for right

746
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,200
now.

747
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
What I'll do is I'll just say like,

748
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Okay, you know, the mouse P, the old UI thing, maybe the old UI and

749
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:40,700
you know what?

750
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,400
I could even do that, that doesn't even have to happen in here.

751
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Now, I think about it, I could do that in a totally different way.

752
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
I could do that, where we just have, where we had the left Mouse

753
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
button thing and this thing doesn't even have to know about it.

754
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,600
What I could do is I could say, all right, when we do the the

755
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
interaction, begin stuff, right?

756
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Debugged again, interaction and hear what I could do is say like, if

757
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:14,200
we were about to do an interaction with the right Mouse button, then,

758
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,500
let's do something a little bit different, you know what I'm saying?

759
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Something like that.

760
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Or if the right Mouse button was down at the time or something like

761
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,900
that and then

762
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,900
Will later make that be an ALT key thing?

763
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,400
So we could do something like, you know, input.

764
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,500
Like you I hear I could do this.

765
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,600
so, if the right Mouse button is down,

766
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,500
We're in all UI mode or I guess I should say ended down.

767
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,100
There we go.

768
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,200
So if the right Mouse button is down at the time there were in all UI

769
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,800
mode and we'll just go ahead and make the begin interact up here to

770
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,900
get interact.

771
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,600
Well, how about you I hear

772
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,500
Like so.

773
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
And then what we'll do there is what just say like if there was a hot

774
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,100
thing, right?

775
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,200
Then if there's a hot interaction, will do it.

776
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,700
If there's not a hot interaction.

777
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,900
What we'll do instead here is will say, well, if the old UI is

778
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,500
happening, we always want to tear the value, right?

779
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:29,500
So if the all UI is happening, then we're just going to force the

780
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,600
value to be a tear

781
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,800
Otherwise.

782
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,200
We won't.

783
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,100
Something like that.

784
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
And I guess now I think about it.

785
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,500
This could, this could happen up here as well.

786
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,200
Let's see.

787
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,800
There we go.

788
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,100
So that's all good but we didn't actually ever Implement Terror value.

789
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,500
So now I actually do have to implement Terror value.

790
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,900
You know what I'm saying?

791
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,000
And so we've got dragged value right?

792
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,300
And we implemented that but we never implemented tear value.

793
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
So let's go ahead and do that.

794
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Here's tear value.

795
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,400
Like so and when we want to do at are value, all we want to do for

796
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,500
Terror value is just, we just want to create right.

797
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,500
Another, you know, some other sort of

798
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,100
Some other one of these, add hierarchy things, right?

799
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,000
And then we just want that to sort of persist.

800
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,500
So we want to do something like you know, we have a debug variable

801
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,600
hierarchy, right?

802
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,000
Which is like the the dragging hierarchy this sort of thing.

803
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,700
you know I'm saying and that is just a variable that we would set here

804
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,400
where we'd say like okay, you know if you had not actually done

805
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:11,500
That yet if you had not created the debug State Dragon hierarchy, then

806
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,500
go ahead and create that reading hierarchy equals add Harkey,

807
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,200
interacting with whatever the thing is that we're interacting with.

808
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,200
That's the variable that we want their, right?

809
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Trying to think if we also need a new group to hold this variable, I

810
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,600
think we do.

811
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,500
So we actually want to do to hear as we want to.

812
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,500
To add a group, a new group.

813
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,700
I'm going to hold off on that for one second.

814
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,200
Just one little second, right?

815
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,200
And then we're going to do is we're just going to say like wherever

816
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,000
the mouse is like, I don't look wherever it is.

817
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
The debug State dragging Harkey.

818
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,000
You IP is going to be equal to that location.

819
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,000
Right?

820
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,600
And then debug hierarchy whenever we end our interaction, like when

821
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,100
were clearing out our state will just clear out that state and will be

822
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,400
done.

823
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,800
You know.

824
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,900
Okay, so if we do an ad hierarchy here, what we need to know at this

825
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,300
point like I said is we need to have some way of adding a group

826
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,600
because you can see that this is supposed to take a debug variable

827
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,300
reference.

828
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,800
and at the moment,

829
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,500
We aren't giving it that, and I'm pretty sure it needs a reference to

830
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,200
an actual group as well.

831
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,000
So, we, what we want to do here is, have some way of adding a debug

832
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,300
variable group directly, write a reference to a group.

833
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,000
So, we want a thing that's like, you know, like our debug begin

834
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,900
variable group thing, right?

835
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,300
We want to be able to do that but we want to be able to do that

836
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,300
outside of having a context, right?

837
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,200
So we want to be able to do something that does like debug

838
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,200
Add route group, something like that, which just takes the debug

839
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,300
content, the debug state.

840
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,200
By itself.

841
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,200
And can go from there so it can add the group it'll set its expansion

842
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,000
I guess in this case would be expanded would be set to true if the

843
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,400
route group it initialize its children stuff to not have anything in

844
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,500
it or anything like that.

845
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,800
And it'll set, you know, it'll set us up to actually use that thing.

846
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,300
As a root group.

847
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,200
Now we need a context of do, debug, add variable.

848
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,900
But what I'm going to do here is just

849
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,100
You know what?

850
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,600
I'm just thinking this through.

851
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,600
If we always have a group for every one of these floaty things,

852
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,500
Then really, these don't need to be referenced variables, do they?

853
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,300
So really they'd be these things that makes sense?

854
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,200
So really what we're looking at is something more like this, right?

855
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,600
or you might even say debug state state,

856
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,500
State feedback Arena.

857
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,100
You know, I'm saying.

858
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,800
And then these guys, when they actually call debug add-on reference

859
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,500
variable, it would just, you know, call it like that or whatever.

860
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,400
This is what we actually, I think probably want because there's no

861
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,200
reason to create a variable reference for that as far as I can think

862
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,500
of.

863
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,800
So when we do add route group, what we actually be doing is, is adding

864
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,700
on a reference variable, right?

865
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,900
And we do it, it would look like this, right?

866
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,200
So we do debug add-on reference variable.

867
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,200
We passed the state.

868
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,600
and it would be nice if we can get these two things to play together

869
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,700
and I think that we can write probably, what we would do is we just do

870
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
this where we say like okay,

871
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,400
You know, add a route group or something like that.

872
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,400
Like like this, you know, add a route group and then add the reference

873
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,200
for the route group immediately thereafter.

874
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,300
You know what I'm saying?

875
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,200
So be like this sort of thing.

876
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,400
Where we just do.

877
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:37,900
That.

878
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,900
And then, we could set it so that it's this, these guys don't expand

879
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,100
by default or something like that, right?

880
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,800
That seems that seems pretty same to me.

881
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,000
I know how you guys feel about it, but that seems reasonable, right?

882
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,700
Or at least somewhat reasonable.

883
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,900
okay, so I'm going to just make this

884
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,100
Go away for a second.

885
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,700
So and then I'm going to double check that.

886
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,400
That worked to add the stuff normally, it does.

887
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,500
Okay so now to finish our caring implementation, what we do here is

888
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,800
say okay when were dragging these things, what I want to be able to do

889
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,800
is I want to be able to add a route group here like so and then oops,

890
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,800
it's not right.

891
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,200
What I want to be I'll do is add a route group here.

892
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,400
Look at Route group.

893
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,200
And then, what I want to do is I want to add the variable to the

894
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,100
group, right?

895
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,500
I want to add a reference of the variable to that particular group.

896
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,800
And again, that's going to force me to kind of make this be a

897
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,500
two-level thing.

898
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,700
That's not going to use the context anymore, but that's okay.

899
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,400
Right.

900
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,200
Totally fine with that.

901
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,000
So if we do debug ad route group here, this will give me back a debug

902
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,300
variable.

903
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,300
That's my route group.

904
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,300
The route group itself will be the thing that the hierarchy sees.

905
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,400
Like that.

906
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,800
And again, they'll just take the debug State and the route group will

907
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,300
just take a name and I guess it doesn't really need a name because

908
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,600
it's never displayed.

909
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
It's just going to be like a user group, I guess or something like

910
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,400
that.

911
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,500
I don't know.

912
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,900
It never actually show that name.

913
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,300
I don't think, I don't actually know, we'll have to verify that that's

914
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,700
true.

915
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,100
But yes, I'm pretty sure that's true.

916
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,200
And so now all I really have to do is just go through here and

917
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,500
presumably make it so that that ad hierarchy actually,

918
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,500
Make sure that that takes a debug variable for the group, and the

919
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,600
hierarchies themselves are always taking debug variables, right?

920
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,500
So, something like this,

921
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,400
Okay, so

922
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,000
The context group.

923
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,000
In this case, we'll just grab the variable out.

924
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
Same thing here.

925
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,800
So in this case we don't have to dereference it by VAR and so we're

926
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,900
just doing this and now this should work I think properly and you can

927
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,200
kind of see there that it does.

928
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,100
Right?

929
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,800
And so now I just need to make it so that we can tear the values off.

930
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:21,000
We've already implemented the code for it essentially but what we have

931
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,400
not done is made it so that it actually adds anything now.

932
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:25,400
And interaction.

933
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,600
I guess the terror value doesn't actually need to do anything.

934
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,200
I don't think.

935
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm pretty sure it only needs to do it here.

936
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,400
And so what we really need now is just a way of taking whatever the

937
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,000
thing was that, you were interacting with and adding it to that group.

938
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,300
So we want to do something like, you know,

939
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,200
Add variable to group.

940
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,200
Or debug add reference, I guess would be the thing.

941
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,200
So inside the variables thing where we have the add variable

942
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,900
reference.

943
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,400
Dear God variable reference we want to do is make it so that context

944
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,700
thing isn't actually required anymore.

945
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
So when you add a variable,

946
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,900
Friends what we'd say is like okay then you're going to need the debug

947
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,000
State because we need to be able to allocate it.

948
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,200
You're going to need the variable.

949
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,700
But then now we'll just say, OK, say there is a group, so you pass it,

950
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,300
the group and the variable and it just does that it just adds it to

951
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,800
that group, right?

952
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,800
And so, if I wanted to do that, all I would do is say the debug arena

953
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,100
is the arena are coming from so, you know, that's fine.

954
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,000
We have the debug variable reference, we allocate that we do all the

955
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,100
stuff that we need to do here, but now, instead of getting that group

956
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,900
out of context instead,

957
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,900
We get it like this, right?

958
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,500
And I don't think we need anything else there.

959
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,900
Well, I lied that's very sad.

960
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:48,000
Since people use their parents as a reference

961
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,600
Although in this case I do they even need to do that.

962
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,000
They don't.

963
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
So I guess they don't need a parent.

964
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,700
So I guess that's actually all fine too.

965
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,700
No.

966
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,000
I mean since you want to have the rest of so I guess I do.

967
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,500
You know I was hoping I get away with that.

968
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,800
If it doesn't look like it, it doesn't look like it.

969
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,800
It looks like this is going to have to be that way.

970
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,400
So that's the way it has to go fine by me.

971
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,900
Don't really care one way or the other.

972
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,100
So anyway,

973
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,200
Moving on, we do the exact same thing.

974
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,200
We were doing here.

975
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Everything's the same.

976
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,300
The only difference is we don't sort of Loft it out of the context.

977
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,400
We just get it directly.

978
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,300
So it's the exact same function.

979
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,600
And so, all this is going to do.

980
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,100
Now is just, do you know, it's just literally going to do a pass

981
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,400
through, right?

982
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,000
So, when you're calling it from the sort of Builder context, like we

983
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,900
were using before, where your career instructing, these lists, you

984
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,900
would call it this way.

985
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,500
And here, what it does is it says, like, okay, when I'm going to pass,

986
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,300
What I'm going to pass this in, what I'm going to do is I'm going to

987
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,500
grab that group out of the context.

988
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,300
Like this.

989
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,500
And then it's going to be called the exact same code that anyone else

990
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,200
could call when they don't have a context, right?

991
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,200
So, this way, again, turning the context, just into like a helper for

992
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,900
that code below and since you don't ever actually need one.

993
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,700
So if we do, if we do it that way, we should be able to Now call debug

994
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,400
add variable reference directly this.

995
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,600
Unfortunately, again, I'm going to have to say that we do have to do

996
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,100
it the way that I was going to do it before.

997
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,400
I didn't really want to do it that way.

998
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,100
But turns out, we have to because the fact that our tree uses that as

999
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,300
a parent pointer kind,

1000
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,300
If there's really no way of getting around it but then we just say,

1001
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,600
okay, whatever the thing was we were interacting with now we're going

1002
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,200
to tear it off, right?

1003
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,700
And so we're going to add that in and we're going to go from they're

1004
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,400
going to make that BR Harkey.

1005
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,100
And that's pretty much all we would need to do.

1006
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,900
But that just means that I have to make it so that we could do to me.

1007
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,800
I think we're going to do before so let me just go ahead and make that

1008
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,100
work.

1009
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:52,700
There we go.

1010
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,600
Do you look at variable none of the overloads, convert all the

1011
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,500
argument types?

1012
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,800
Debug add variable reference

1013
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,600
Context State, there we go.

1014
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,800
And then debug add route group, like I said before, debug at Route

1015
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,500
group just now does have to be a thing that actually adds a variable

1016
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,600
reference which is not particularly tough.

1017
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It just means that now the debug variable reference it will have, it

1018
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,100
will have to actually call to make one of those four are stinking that

1019
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,000
we would not actually have to make one of those, but it turns out that

1020
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,500
we do.

1021
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,900
So when we

1022
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,500
Add the route group here.

1023
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,800
In fact really, it's sort of almost exact same as this thing, too.

1024
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,400
It just means that when we add the route group,

1025
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,700
We're going to have to do something like this where we add the

1026
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,500
variable reference.

1027
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,700
We're going to pass zero cure because it's the route group and then

1028
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,600
we'd pass the VAR here like this and then we'd pass that state, right?

1029
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:56,200
So I think all of that stuff is going to be basically the same.

1030
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,600
I don't think there would be anything else that we'd have to do with

1031
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,000
it.

1032
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,200
But again, it does mean that when we call debug add route group here,

1033
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,400
we would be able to do that.

1034
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,500
So, what we do is we say debug variable reference, right?

1035
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,900
This would be debug variable there.

1036
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,800
And this would be like, debug.

1037
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,900
Ad group group, debug state state are surname, right?

1038
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,500
Let's go ahead and return that.

1039
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,500
Okay.

1040
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,200
So now this is basically our debug a drupe internal, right?

1041
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,800
Look, nobody else is going to ever call that.

1042
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,300
It's just a utility and now we have two ways that's called, right?

1043
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,300
We have one way that calls it here.

1044
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,100
Right.

1045
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,500
You can see that and I guess I could do it this way will be easier to

1046
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:44,900
read.

1047
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,600
So you've won way the calls it there.

1048
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,000
That's the guy who actually has to add it using the context and it's a

1049
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:51,800
little bit tortured.

1050
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,600
I would unwind this if we weren't on stream it's not so you know

1051
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,600
they're just some fussing I could do to make that a little online but

1052
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,800
I want to finish this up and we only have about five minutes left so

1053
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,600
I'm not going to do it right now or ever potentially.

1054
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,800
But anyway, so we go ahead and do debug a drupe internal.

1055
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,900
We can call that now from here, as well.

1056
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,600
Here's debug a blueprint route, group internal.

1057
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,500
Mmm.

1058
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,800
Being called a second time.

1059
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,600
When I call that here, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to add a

1060
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,900
reference as well, but I'm not going to use the context call, right?

1061
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,400
So instead what I'm going to do is called debug, add variable

1062
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,200
reference with the one that takes the state and the group to add 2,

1063
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,700
which is nobody in this case.

1064
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,600
So that'll add that variable reference and allow me to return the

1065
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,300
group ref like so,

1066
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,800
So that's really all I need to do there.

1067
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,400
I think

1068
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,700
And then I'll just fix picks up whatever else there is.

1069
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,300
There we go.

1070
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:50,700
Yeah.

1071
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:51,500
Yeah.

1072
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,600
Now, add Harkey goes back to the way that it was before.

1073
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,800
Jen nothing, particularly special there and just have to fix the

1074
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,300
compiler.

1075
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,500
Has that that introduced?

1076
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:12,000
Which is that the debug Road group is now back to exactly.

1077
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,800
And this is just basically reverting that change, right?

1078
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,100
That's all I'm doing here.

1079
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,800
Nothing else.

1080
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,900
And that's about it for that.

1081
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,600
Okay, so let's take a look what happens here.

1082
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,700
I don't know where we're at.

1083
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,000
When I hold down the right Mouse button, I think that was the cue for

1084
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,100
doing the tear off.

1085
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,700
So let's see what happens.

1086
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,500
Let's see.

1087
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,700
Oops, that's supposed to be a, not dragging hierarchy.

1088
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,900
So off we go, let's see what happens.

1089
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,500
So, if I drag this now, I've got another group out there.

1090
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,400
Perfect.

1091
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,100
Yeah.

1092
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,600
There we go.

1093
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,000
And so, you can see kind of what happens here.

1094
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,500
I can now have multiple ones of these and the only problem that we

1095
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,700
have now is, you know, things like the expansion, state of these guys

1096
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,600
is mirrored because they're going to be in the same, like, sort of

1097
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,500
situation right now I could so it's pretty easy.

1098
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,000
If I build a new group out here, you know, I can put

1099
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,600
Guys, I can leave them out here and those all work pretty nicely.

1100
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,600
But yeah, again, what I might want to do is have it so that the expand

1101
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,800
and collapse state for groups is going to be something that actually

1102
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,600
gets sort of.

1103
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:36,100
It gets its own state for that and there's multiple ways that we could

1104
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,800
do that.

1105
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,500
There's actually two different ways.

1106
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,800
To do that.

1107
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,500
What I'd like to do instead of focusing on that at all at the moment

1108
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,300
as I'd like to do one more thing first and then we could maybe talk

1109
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:55,300
about that next week since we don't have a whole lot of time here.

1110
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,600
I'd like to be able to move these guys around.

1111
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,100
You know I'd like to be able to move.

1112
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,800
Once I put them somewhere, I'd like to be able to do something other

1113
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,800
than pulling them off like I am at the moment.

1114
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,200
You know, I'd like to be able to sort of move them once they've been

1115
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,800
pushed and so what

1116
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,500
Going to do there to is just again, introduced a little UI element,

1117
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,600
something pretty simple.

1118
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,300
Which is something, you know, that's going to be, I don't know,

1119
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:28,100
something like this which is really, you know, move hierarchy or

1120
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,100
something like that.

1121
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,700
Something like this and that would just do something where it would

1122
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:35,900
go.

1123
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,800
Like, okay, if you're going to move,

1124
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,900
If you're going to move a hierarchy, it will take whatever the

1125
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,200
dragging hierarchy, uip is, and it will do the sort of same thing that

1126
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,200
was doing with the with the Mouse stuff, right?

1127
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,600
So I'd like to have a way to do that.

1128
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,800
So I'm going to go ahead and add that.

1129
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,100
A priority.

1130
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,600
And the only problem with that is we don't currently have any way of

1131
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,600
actually making that do anything, right?

1132
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,800
We don't have a way of getting, you know, saying that we want that to

1133
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,800
be what happens.

1134
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,100
But I should be able to do something relatively quickly that allows us

1135
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,700
to make it so that you can do that.

1136
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,600
Juvie.

1137
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,100
Not sure what the easiest way would be.

1138
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,800
But one way might be, I could take, you know, one of these, one of

1139
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,200
these sorts of things here, right?

1140
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,700
And when I first draw the hierarchy, maybe.

1141
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,400
What I do is I do some kind of a thing where I create a box which is

1142
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,500
like the movement box for the thing.

1143
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah.

1144
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Or something like this.

1145
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,100
And I say that that's going to be whatever the uip of this thing is,

1146
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,100
you know, there's like a little kind of, there's a little hot.

1147
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,900
Hot guy there and maybe we'll do them at the end.

1148
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,400
So he always has Primacy as well, you know?

1149
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
So we'll do that.

1150
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,500
You know, will render the thing?

1151
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,700
Do a push wrecked, we'll call this.

1152
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:10,800
The move box will do some kind of, you know,

1153
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,500
We'll do some kind of a test on it.

1154
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,300
Like, if you know what, I don't really care about this.

1155
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,300
The moment I'll leave this as just a thing we're gonna do is we don't

1156
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,400
have much time left.

1157
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,400
And so now what I want to do is when I drag one of these out, right?

1158
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,400
I get a little box there, I guess there's a little box in the corner

1159
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,500
and what I might do is I might move it back a little bit from the uip,

1160
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:34,800
right?

1161
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:40,000
I might move it like, you know, so that it's off a little bit from the

1162
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,600
UI p.

1163
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,300
And so, if we are inside that rectangle, then what I'm going to say

1164
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:49,300
is, you know, we've got something like, if it's inside the rectangle,

1165
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:52,000
whatever the move box is to me.

1166
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,700
Then what I'm going to do is say the next tide interaction, right?

1167
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:04,300
Is going to be to move the hierarchy and the next hot thing where we

1168
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,200
do this next hot hierarchy or whatever is going to be me.

1169
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,700
Right, and you'll notice the next hierarchy thing.

1170
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,700
This is kind of going to motivate the next change that I would want to

1171
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,900
do here and I kind of alluded to it on the previous dream.

1172
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,100
How these things start to proliferate?

1173
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,500
I'll sort of probably want to start out Monday by doing this one, but

1174
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,600
we're going to leave it that way for now.

1175
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,000
So if we do that that's what we'll do.

1176
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,900
It's all good.

1177
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,900
And then here we'll have a thing where we're like, okay, debug

1178
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,900
hierarchy

1179
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,100
Next hot hierarchy.

1180
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,300
That.

1181
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,000
So then what I want to do and, you know, thinking about it too.

1182
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,400
I feel like we probably could avoid that if we want to buy just having

1183
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,100
tea, but to having Harkins themselves, we debug variables that

1184
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,700
probably would have been a smart thing to do.

1185
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,700
It's very tempting.

1186
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,900
That's very, very tempting actually.

1187
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,700
Mmm.

1188
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,600
That would have been really smart.

1189
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,500
I'm going to say that to do.

1190
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,000
Car keys should be debug variables.

1191
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,300
So I'm going to I'm going to say that that should happen.

1192
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,600
But anyway, for a moment I'll just implement it in this kind of very

1193
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,900
sloppy fashion.

1194
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,800
And what I will do is say, okay, the next Harkey is going to be that

1195
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,300
thing.

1196
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,200
And so then what I'll say is, you know, when we do this thing when we

1197
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200
do the next hot thing there, right?

1198
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:45,300
When when we do debug State, hot interaction that stuff, I'm going to

1199
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,100
say that dragging hierarchy, equals next hierarchy.

1200
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,200
That's it.

1201
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,900
So okay.

1202
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,700
So yeah, there's a couple ways we could do that.

1203
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,000
Actually.

1204
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,800
Now, I think about it that are pretty easy to.

1205
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,800
So, we'll see.

1206
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,000
So yeah.

1207
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,700
So let's see if we can make this work at all.

1208
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,500
So I should also do a thing where we can see whether we're inside

1209
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,000
that.

1210
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,800
So we know whether we're actually able to drag it or not, let me see

1211
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,700
what happens with next hot Harkey here.

1212
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,000
When I do dragging hierarchy, debug.

1213
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Interact, hot interaction, interaction goes hot interaction ragging,

1214
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,900
hierarchy equals zero at the end of the end attract.

1215
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,800
Okay so move box if is inside rectangle, move box you books 8?

1216
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,200
Next hunt, interaction equals move hierarchy next.

1217
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,800
Hierarchy equals hierarchy.

1218
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,900
I feel like that should have worked but it did not work.

1219
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,300
Why not?

1220
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,400
Why did it not work?

1221
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,100
Someone needs to tell me why it didn't work.

1222
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,600
And I'm not sure.

1223
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,800
Yeah.

1224
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,100
All right.

1225
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,500
Well,

1226
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,700
What's the bucket?

1227
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,600
Drop that guy.

1228
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah, so never it never even gets in there.

1229
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,500
Next Harkey.

1230
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,000
You better state next Harkey.

1231
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,000
Let's see.

1232
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,800
Oh Next, Top hierarchy also, I wouldn't be having clearing it although

1233
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
that doesn't actually matter.

1234
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,100
Next hot.

1235
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:58,900
There we go.

1236
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,800
But doesn't really actually matter at all.

1237
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,700
And in fact, technically next hot and next hard, umm it's really just

1238
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,500
debug interaction.

1239
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,600
None is the only thing that actually ever has to be cleared, but I

1240
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,900
just like to do that so I can see it, right?

1241
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,300
So what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to say that like okay

1242
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:22,600
when we do this stuff I'm going to debug text line hierarchy.

1243
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,100
I'm going to do that.

1244
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,000
If the debug state.

1245
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,500
Next hot hierarchy was nonzero.

1246
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,900
right, so when we do debug interact and we come through

1247
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,400
The debug drum anything at the end of it, I'm just going to say let's

1248
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:50,300
add a text line if we if it thought we were interacting with the

1249
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,700
hierarchy at that time.

1250
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,100
Right.

1251
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,900
So there we go.

1252
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,800
So it does think we're interacting with it.

1253
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,500
But for some reason we never set the we never set the thing, right?

1254
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,500
So I'm going to go ahead and set a breakpoint at begin interact, just

1255
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,400
to see what happens.

1256
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:13,200
Yes, so it's never allowed to actually push the left Mouse button for

1257
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,500
reasons unknown.

1258
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,700
Oops,

1259
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,000
So, let's see.

1260
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,200
So it's just because it requires hot, that's dumb hot.

1261
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,000
Interaction is supposed to be the thing that we check.

1262
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,900
So that's just dumb, because that never should have been that way,

1263
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,600
right?

1264
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,700
It's only ever supposed to look like this.

1265
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,200
It's only supposed to say like okay if there's a hot interaction we

1266
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,900
always set the hot interaction if there isn't a hot interaction then

1267
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,600
we would actually go into to this situation, right?

1268
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,900
Because if there's a hot interaction, you always do it.

1269
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,900
You just assume that the person knew what they were doing, maybe a bad

1270
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,600
assumption but you assume it anyway, right?

1271
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:09,800
Yeah, that's how that should actually work and then if they don't

1272
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,900
click on anything, right?

1273
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,900
If there was nothing, that was hot.

1274
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,800
Fact, this this thing should be in here as well.

1275
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,000
If there's nothing that was hot.

1276
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,100
Then we just have this else case which is the to do the no op.

1277
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,400
Alright, so let's try that again.

1278
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,500
That was just an oversight in the way, I originally wrote that code.

1279
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,200
That was not what I had ever intended.

1280
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,700
That's just how it ended up in the series of steps we did to make it

1281
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,500
so now we're all good here.

1282
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:42,200
Looks like pretty good and this stuff all still works.

1283
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,400
It looks like so that's good.

1284
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,500
And now we can do are tearing off which I wanted to do.

1285
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,000
So there we tear that off.

1286
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,500
And in theory there we go.

1287
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:51,800
Now we can drag as well.

1288
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,600
Although

1289
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,300
whoa.

1290
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,600
looks like debug and interact assumes, we're always interacting with

1291
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,800
something, which is not

1292
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:05,900
What I ever actually wanted that to do and in fact should no longer be

1293
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:10,200
an assertion because that's not something that I even care about that.

1294
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,600
Looks like just some sort of vestigial remain, so that's fine.

1295
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:18,800
All right so maybe that should go here because toggle value obviously

1296
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,200
should always have one but all right,

1297
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:25,500
All right.

1298
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,500
Yay.

1299
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,300
So that's pretty nice.

1300
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,700
We're slowly, but surely getting there.

1301
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,800
Building a reasonable UI system, it takes a few hours, but a few hours

1302
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
is not very long.

1303
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,700
And there's we're starting to get to the point where most of the

1304
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:50,000
fundamental things are there and we just would want to polish them

1305
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,800
maybe a little, you know, so they're not quite so ugly or janky.

1306
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,700
But at this point, you know, you can do some pretty crazy stuff and it

1307
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,000
all kind of works which is nice.

1308
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:06,200
So I'll go ahead and go to a brief Q&A now now that we've got all that

1309
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,400
working and we'll see what's going down.

1310
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:17,000
So if you have any questions about we we did we will answer them.

1311
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,400
Now, if you could please put 2: in front of it.

1312
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,900
That would be pretty sweet so that I could see them.

1313
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,800
Oh dear.

1314
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,900
I should also probably get rid of that little debug print out.

1315
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,800
Connor, Brent says no questions.

1316
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,700
Well, if you don't have any questions.

1317
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,800
Then that's it.

1318
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,500
You just be like, all right, we're done.

1319
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,100
Nothing to see here.

1320
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,400
K you mentioned, that encapsulation is good but not in the loop way.

1321
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,800
Could you elaborate then in which way you mean?

1322
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,500
I just mean that it's fine to calve off sections of your project and

1323
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,000
say that they are you know not supposed to be used by the outside

1324
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,800
world, right?

1325
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:22,000
Meaning once you're certain that something is like totally set the way

1326
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:22,700
it should go.

1327
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,399
You know, if you want to go ahead and move that out of like you know

1328
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:27,300
the public interface for that thing.

1329
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,200
Then that's fine, you know?

1330
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:37,500
And I'll do that sometimes just mentally where I'm like, okay, you

1331
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,600
know, I'll put a bunch of stuff in an h-file.

1332
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,600
And these are the functions, you should call to use this system and

1333
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,500
I'll take a bunch of the structs and a bunch of the functions out of

1334
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:45,800
the HVAC.

1335
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,899
I'm just put them in the CPP.

1336
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:51,500
So it's kind of clear like these are the things you should call and

1337
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,300
you shouldn't worry about anything else, right?

1338
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,399
Because this, you know, sort of Library thing, or whatever it is that

1339
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,800
I made doesn't, you know, there are certain things that I want you.

1340
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,399
Sounds certain things that you don't and that's fine.

1341
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,399
If that makes sense.

1342
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,899
Insofar as our, the menu items spaced evenly vertically, it looks a

1343
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:12,500
bit odd to me.

1344
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,399
No, they're not at the moment.

1345
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:18,700
The reason for that is because we don't actually use the font spacing

1346
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
what we use is the rectangle spacing, which means that if something

1347
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
has no descenders, it takes up less size and we can change that if you

1348
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,200
want to, it's pretty simple, right?

1349
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:35,899
Basically, all that's doing is in here where we do the this thing

1350
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:39,100
where we do like the the first child, whatever debug text out.

1351
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,000
Sighs thing.

1352
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,800
What we would do instead is, when we do debug, get text size.

1353
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,899
What we do is we force the bounds,

1354
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:50,899
To actually be different.

1355
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:58,300
So what we do is say, in fact, I guess what we do here is say that the

1356
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:05,800
backgrounds of the text size should be made to ensure that they are

1357
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,000
exactly the line size, right?

1358
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:17,300
So whatever the line size is get line advance for this thing, right?

1359
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,400
So what we want to do there and I think that's supposed to be

1360
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,500
multiplied by the font scale, right?

1361
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,100
Aunt, scale times.

1362
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,200
Yeah.

1363
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:33,900
So line advance for line advance.

1364
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,800
Yeah, so basically that's what the line Advance should be.

1365
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,000
So what we'd want to do there is just say, like, okay, in the case

1366
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,600
that we're drawing a text element if you want to make sure they're all

1367
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,400
spaced evenly instead of using the actual bounds here, you just say,

1368
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,400
well, instead of that.

1369
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:04,300
Let's actually just use whatever the whatever the line Advance is,

1370
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,200
right?

1371
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,800
So, what we'd say, is the bounds min

1372
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,300
Should equal the bounds.

1373
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,300
Max minus the line advance.

1374
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:19,900
You know I'm saying and I suppose that's the band Min y, right?

1375
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,100
And that would just be if you wanted to force them all, to be always

1376
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,900
the same size, and now you can kind of see that happening there,

1377
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:29,600
right?

1378
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,000
Hopefully that didn't disconnect me.

1379
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:42,600
Don't think it did.

1380
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:50,500
So yeah, so now these these should be more reasonable sizes, least, I

1381
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,100
think so.

1382
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,600
Let me double-check that I did that right down.

1383
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,600
Okay, Tim bounce.

1384
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:08,700
Yeah.

1385
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,200
And I think, you know what you do is you get rid of the spacing?

1386
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,300
Why thing as well?

1387
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:20,100
That would just be baked in there and we'd probably say that whatever

1388
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,600
when this thing did its thing.

1389
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,800
Well no, you probably put the spacing in there, you would probably put

1390
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,600
the spacing in there.

1391
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:35,400
So there's some room between them that maybe you wouldn't have, you

1392
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:35,600
wouldn't?

1393
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,100
I don't know.

1394
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,300
It's hard to say.

1395
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,600
It's hard to say, you know, the other way to do it is you put it in

1396
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:45,900
here.

1397
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,400
so, you would say something like,

1398
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,800
Bounds.

1399
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,400
Batman.

1400
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,100
Why - equal spacing?

1401
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:56,500
Why?

1402
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,000
So things that aren't text, they get spaced.

1403
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,400
They get that spacing.

1404
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Since they don't have a font line Advance telling them how they should

1405
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,300
be spaced.

1406
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,400
I feel like that would maybe make that work, you know what I mean?

1407
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:14,700
But yeah.

1408
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,900
So I think that's where it roughly.

1409
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:17,900
What we would want to do.

1410
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,700
So that makes sure that the band's minhwan

1411
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,800
Max YY.

1412
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,300
Yeah and so really all.

1413
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,000
So I suppose the other thing you have to do is this stuff.

1414
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,600
We really, if you want it all to be that way, after we get the text

1415
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,600
size, we would want to Center, we would want to just just use the Min

1416
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,300
and Max basically, right?

1417
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,000
So we'd really do this, we'd really do rectangle, text bounds, like

1418
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,500
that.

1419
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:55,300
And then we do rectangle bounds, equal some, you know, something like

1420
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:55,600
this.

1421
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:02,500
We'd say rectangle min-max and we'd say we want it to be here, right?

1422
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:13,000
We'd want it to do - whatever the Baseline thing was.

1423
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,000
Right?

1424
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,000
That's where we would want it to.

1425
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,000
Or I guess.

1426
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,100
Yeah, I guess we'd want to do the left side, we'd want to do the

1427
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,100
bottom, which would just be the total, you know, however, much the the

1428
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,100
line advanced was that's where the bottom is, right?

1429
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:37,700
and,

1430
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,400
The top is the top.

1431
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,300
And the right is just going to be the left PX plus, whatever the width

1432
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,500
of the, of the original one was, right?

1433
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,100
Whatever the text bands were, in fact, this one you could kind of do

1434
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,000
like, okay, the text bounds Min EX

1435
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,300
Whatever that left PX is, it's just going to be the left, the X plus

1436
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,700
the Min, right?

1437
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,700
And the left PX

1438
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,300
the max.

1439
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,800
So that constructs the actual box, that is not sensitive to where the

1440
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:24,200
text act, to what the text actual size is that just ignores the fact

1441
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,400
that different texts are different sizes, because they may, or may not

1442
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,800
have descenders or ascenders, right?

1443
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,800
I think that would actually be what you would want to do, right?

1444
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,500
And I don't remember exactly what this is.

1445
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,600
Maybe recommend Max.

1446
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:48,900
Yeah, so that's I think what you would want to do if you want to

1447
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,600
eliminate any variability in the spacing and just space things

1448
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,200
directly.

1449
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,200
Oops.

1450
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,600
That PX top view.

1451
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:02,300
I did I do wrong there left the X Plus text bounds Min X.

1452
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,500
And text bounds, Max dot X.

1453
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:15,100
I feel like that should have been right Top py- Line advance and top

1454
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,000
py.

1455
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,800
What happened?

1456
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,600
Bad there.

1457
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,300
Oh, gotta love that variable shadowing.

1458
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,300
There we go.

1459
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:32,000
So that uses the actual line advance and so that should always be the

1460
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,600
same now and it does look like it is so that's probably fine.

1461
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,300
I don't know if that's what you wanted but that's how you would do

1462
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:40,800
that.

1463
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:43,500
Yeah.

1464
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,700
Why is there so much lag latency when dragging the hierarchy is

1465
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,100
around?

1466
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,900
Or is that just Twitch streaming artifacts?

1467
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Well, me, see ya on my machine.

1468
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,400
It's pretty much instantaneous.

1469
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,800
The only the, the lag there is one bit of lag and that just happens

1470
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,500
whenever the debug system resets, right?

1471
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:15,400
Because we've never finished doing that part of the process, where the

1472
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,100
debug collation thing happens, remember,

1473
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:22,300
So, debug collation is still expensive there.

1474
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,800
Because we never we've never made a cheap.

1475
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,300
If you turned debug collation off, you would never have any hiccups.

1476
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,500
You can see, it's, there's no lag at all.

1477
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:36,300
And then when it does the debug collation, you get that hiccup, right?

1478
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:39,600
And that's not a hiccup in the debug system, or in the game room.

1479
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,000
That's literally just the collator, just the collator.

1480
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,200
And so, if you just turned off player, that wouldn't be there, that is

1481
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:45,400
something.

1482
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,900
What we want to, we should probably fix eventually because it actually

1483
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,500
we don't really care about that hiccup necessarily.

1484
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,400
But we do care about the fact that it wipes, the debug

1485
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,600
Every time and so it would be nice to have something that just doesn't

1486
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,800
incremental rolling buffer.

1487
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,000
So that we don't have to, so it doesn't have to ever do that wipe,

1488
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:03,900
right?

1489
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,200
That just be better.

1490
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,000
Are the two different tariffs intended to have identical hierarchies,

1491
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,400
or as the intention that you drill down into different things without

1492
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,900
all the tariffs being affected.

1493
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,600
So I think what we want to do is make it so that you

1494
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,200
Can expand ones differently and also you can add ones like it'd be

1495
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:25,800
nice to make it.

1496
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,800
So, you could just, when you're doing a tear-off, you can have ones

1497
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,600
that like ad.

1498
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,600
So, you know, if I have this, I can then go ahead and like, add just

1499
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,900
one thing to it or, or maybe like, you know, a better example would be

1500
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,600
like if I have just that and now I want to add debug camera to it.

1501
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,100
You know, I take the camera, I want to be able to make

1502
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:57,300
So that it comes in here and could be dropped into that group.

1503
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,400
So I can make my own groups right, which would be really pretty easy

1504
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,100
to do and so that's just one.

1505
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,200
One thing I would like

1506
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,800
I notice you use the internal keyword.

1507
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:15,600
I haven't seen it before.

1508
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,300
What is this purpose?

1509
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,000
It's just pound to find to static.

1510
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,500
The geek pirate.

1511
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,700
I apologize since I came in late, but of course, see what was the

1512
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,100
tolerance and pixels you use for dragging out a subsection.

1513
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,400
We did not do that.

1514
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,400
Ours right now, just tell it, you just use the right Mouse button to

1515
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:33,800
do it.

1516
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,800
You mentioned that for link this at work?

1517
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,300
Used men approaching.

1518
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:40,800
What do you mean?

1519
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,800
I mean we have a thing that generates stuff, super structural stuff.

1520
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,900
So like things like this, it just makes for you.

1521
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Outcasted bird.

1522
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,300
I miss tiny percent of the Stream, So I missed a ton.

1523
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,300
I just want to ask what are some tips for people who want to get into

1524
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,300
designing games?

1525
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,600
Do's, and don'ts, and simple things that are worthwhile.

1526
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:08,000
My only real tip is to try a different stream because this is a

1527
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,400
programming stream, there is no design here.

1528
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,900
Does anyone know if there is plans in the future to add other

1529
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:16,700
platforms work to this project?

1530
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:17,500
Yes.

1531
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,400
We will be supporting many platforms with this project.

1532
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,800
Have you written anything for the PS1?

1533
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,100
No, I have not.

1534
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,200
Blah 238.

1535
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,300
Have you ever played any of the space Quest games?

1536
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,100
Yes, I have music for the space, for the video of the hammer.

1537
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,600
He recite reminds me of it a lot.

1538
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:43,100
I can't say, I remember the music to space Quest well enough off to

1539
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:43,200
go.

1540
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,200
Listen to it sometime.

1541
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,500
I don't really remember what it sounds like.

1542
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:48,800
Martin Cohen.

1543
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,700
Do you plan.

1544
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,900
Do you plan on doing something with the character spacing in the text

1545
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:54,500
renderer?

1546
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,800
No, I do not split a do what?

1547
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,700
Of something.

1548
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,700
Do you mean angry?

1549
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,700
Crow is Sentinel a design pattern that will help with making the

1550
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,200
tortoises of the UI independent?

1551
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,800
Or is that terminology that you've gained in years of tool

1552
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,200
development?

1553
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,700
Not understand what you mean by tearing the interface that seems

1554
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,500
really useful for isolating a series of hierarchies.

1555
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,100
Sentinel is just a word that's used to describe the fact that when you

1556
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,200
you when you make a doubly linked list, you often use an element of

1557
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:21,500
the list.

1558
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,200
As the head and tail pointer.

1559
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,000
We've talked about this on hand meteor before, there's actually an

1560
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,600
episode where I draw it out and show how the link we're links.

1561
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,300
Work long, will you not a huge deal with the labels?

1562
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,600
No longer show of, clicking on them will expand or minimize them.

1563
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,400
Also to glances not clear whether the category.

1564
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,500
What is a ver?

1565
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,300
Yes.

1566
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:43,400
I mean like I said we haven't done any rendering stuff so this is just

1567
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,400
a complete you know.

1568
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,000
Which games console had the worst SDK.

1569
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,000
That's always Nintendo.

1570
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,800
Always, if I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure Nintendo.

1571
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:04,100
Always delivers the worst SDK every time and has never has never been

1572
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,200
beat, but I could be wrong about that.

1573
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,300
That's just my recollection.

1574
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,000
All right.

1575
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,100
Looks like we're good.

1576
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,200
Let's go ahead and wrap it up.

1577
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,300
Wrap it up.

1578
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,100
Here we go.

1579
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,700
All right, thank you, everyone for joining me for this episode of

1580
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,200
handmade here.

1581
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,200
It's my pleasure coding with you.

1582
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,500
As always, our debugging system is coming along quite nicely next

1583
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:39,700
week.

1584
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:43,800
What I'd like to do is start to sort of solidify some of those debug

1585
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,500
interface elements, maybe draw them a little bit better.

1586
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:52,200
In a bunch of cases and start to figure out exactly how to interface

1587
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,200
with our profile code since we don't really have a handle on that

1588
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,100
right now it's do still can't use it very effectively so I'd like to

1589
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,500
spend some time just working out how we're going to actually have a

1590
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,000
good interface so that we can see our profiler at a glance and stuff

1591
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,600
like that.

1592
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,300
But like I said we're getting there.

1593
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,900
We've got some good features in there and I think we'll be able to,

1594
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,300
you know, over the next few days sort of solidify, the debug UI stuff

1595
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:13,800
into something.

1596
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,800
That's pretty usable.

1597
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,400
We do have one more major feature to add.

1598
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,300
Add besides the cleanup, which is that?

1599
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,300
I'd like to add some diagramming support.

1600
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:24,800
That's not too difficult really to do, but there are some subtleties

1601
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,100
to it.

1602
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,000
So that's the one thing that we don't have in there right now.

1603
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:32,800
So that's a feature addition, not just to clean up situation but other

1604
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
than that like I said, mostly at this point.

1605
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,300
Now we're at the point where we need to just start focusing on

1606
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,200
finishing up, everything and cleaning it up.

1607
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,300
Polishing it up so that it's nice and usable and get rid of some of

1608
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,100
the roughness and the ugliness there.

1609
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,900
All right, so that's it for today.

1610
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:50,800
If you would like to follow along with handmade hero, especially since

1611
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,100
there's a nice, big old weekend coming up here and you want to play

1612
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:53,800
around the source code.

1613
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,100
You can always figure to the game on handmade here at dot org comes

1614
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,800
with source code so you can play around with it.

1615
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,800
You can do that right here.

1616
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,500

1621
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,500
If you're interested in something specific that you've seen that I

1622
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,700
said hey we did it that on a previous, handmade hero.

1623
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:22,000
That's the thing that place you want to go for that.

1624
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:28,300
We also have a conference coming up if you go to handmade con dot org

1625
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,200
and made con dot-org, you can see the first post about it.

1626
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,200
We just announced it.

1627
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,100
We have not announced the speaker list yet.

1628
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:39,600
We will be announcing the speaker list yet in the next couple of weeks

1629
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:42,100
and it is a pretty awesome speaker list.

1630
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,300
I will say it is probably my favorite speaker list of all time so far.

1631
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,300
And I still have one more slot to go.

1632
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,700
So that's going to be pretty awesome.

1633
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,600
And yeah, if you

1634
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,200
To get tickets to that.

That is the place to do it.

1636
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,400
That is it for today.

1637
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,700
