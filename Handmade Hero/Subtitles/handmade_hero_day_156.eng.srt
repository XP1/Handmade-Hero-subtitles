00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello, everyone and welcome to handmade.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,600
Here are the show.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,800
We could a complete game live on stream.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,200
No engines, no libraries.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
We are attempting to show the complete development of a game here

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,300
right down to the very last little pixel.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,400
And we just finished up a bunch of major work.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,800
We were doing on Wednesday and so yesterday, I decided we might as

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
well just do something kind of fun and Whimsical.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,700
So what I thought I'd do is I'd show how to make particle system.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,800
So yesterday we made a particle system and I guess

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
Should say before I go any further.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,900
If you pre-ordered the game on handmade here at org and you want to

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,700
follow along at home with this episode today is day 156.

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,900
So you should go ahead and take day, 155 source code, unzip it into a

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,100
directory and that's what I'm going to be starting with here.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,700
Just so you've got kind of you know, the same state as I have the

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,100
same.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,900
The same codes is with a z and so what we did was you know really I

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,600
just showed kind of the very basic

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,400
Of how to make a particle system and you can see that because it's the

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,700
Sprite that we happen to have lying around.

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,600
We, you know, we did used ahead and and I think people sort of ended

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,200
up kind of liking the head particle and you know, so it's kind of

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,700
stuck there.

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,400
I was going to say let's make a little sphere particle to put in there

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,800
but people seem to like the head so I don't know, maybe the head has

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,300
to stay in there but point being you have this little particle system

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:25,600
here.

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,400
And so what I wanted to do today was just finish up kind of talking

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,800
about part.

32
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,100
Call systems and some things.

33
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,800
Maybe showing a few more things that you might want to do with them

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,700
and just kind of again, this is kind of a two-day sort of intro to

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,100
particle systems and then we'll wrap it up and Monday will start

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,000
undoing our asset system memory management stuff.

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,100
So okay, so you know, hopefully everyone understood roughly, what was

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,400
going on there, you know, particle system is a pretty basic idea,

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,700
right?

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,200
We that's no good.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,000
A particle system is basically just a lot of little low-cost entities

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,700
to simulate, right?

43
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,600
The

44
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Buying a particle system is you're going to throw a lot of sort of

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,000
cheap things at the problem?

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,699
Instead of having like an entity, you know, whole entity, which in a

47
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,500
game can be very complex and have a lot of simulation logic and and

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,400
very and can take on a lot of different roles.

49
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,600
We're going to make a lot of small cheap uniform fast, you know stuff

50
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,000
and throw them at the problem to sort of do this simulation for things

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,200
that any of these don't stimulate particularly well like, you know,

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,400
Mists and liquids and gases, and that sort of stuff like we talked

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,000
about.

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,500
And, and so,

55
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,400
You know, that's what we wrote and there's some things that I thought

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,100
I wanted to sort of show you to extend sort of what we did yesterday.

57
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,200
Just again as sort of getting your feet with particle systems for

58
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,100
people who haven't really ever done any particle System Program before

59
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,500
which maybe some folks out there.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,600
So, what I wanted to say is, you know, I wanted to take our particle

61
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
here and do a couple more things with it and a couple more of the

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,200
traditional things that you might do with it.

63
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
And so some of them are

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,000
The first thing I want to do is say, let's add a an actual

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
acceleration to the particle.

66
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,100
Right.

67
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,200
So that when the particles are spawned, we will have a little bit more

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,600
information about what they're going to do physically, right?

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
And so in order to do that, you can see that as we spawn these things,

70
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,600
right?

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,900
I could then say well, you know what, let's make particles subject to

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,000
gravity, so you know they're going to fall down, they're going to fall

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,900
down at some rate and that rate, let's say is going

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,900
To be, you know, negative 9.8 meters per second squared, right?

75
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,600
So our acceleration is going to be the standard acceleration of

76
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,200
gravity.

77
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,700
And then what I want to do is I want to come in here and say that the

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,000
the particles when we update the position like we did here.

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,800
We are also going to update that velocity right by adding it in.

80
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,300
Now, what we can do when we do the update, the velocity we can just do

81
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,500
the sort of standard two-step thing, where we update the velocity and

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,700
then,

83
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,400
The position, which is not quite accurate, right?

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,500
If we were worried about saving every extra, like little tiny cycle.

85
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,400
Maybe we would do something like that, but we really don't have to do

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,600
that.

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,100
Instead, what we can do is the full equations of motion, like we

88
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,100
talked about 1/2, a teaspoon, where'd assume you guys remember this

89
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,300
from, we talked about it to account for the complete effect, over the

90
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,600
entire time, step of that, you know, of that acceleration, right.

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
So I'm just going to go ahead and type that

92
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,200
It out.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,300
And if you don't know what I'm talking about, then that would be, it

94
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,200
would be a good time to go back and watch the episode on equations of

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,700
motion.

96
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,500
So that, you know why I'm adding, you know, 0.5 f.

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,600
Times the time step squared times, the times the acceleration into the

98
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,200
position.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,100
And so that's a little bit more of an of an accurate integration.

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,000
But again, it would work regardless of which one you were doing.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,100
And again, since particles are supposed to be sort of fast cheap acts

102
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,300
in a lot of ways, really, any way that you want to update it, that

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
accounts for acceleration in some reasonable physical.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,800
Fashion is probably going to be fine, right?

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,600
So, let's take a look at what happens if I run that now?

106
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,700
Kind of see those guys falling down, right?

107
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,600
Kind of like a sort of a waterfall effect sort of thing.

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,100
And so, in order to counteract the effects of gravity, we probably

109
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,200
want to start them with a stronger upward Force, right?

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,800
So, you know, if we were going to and I'll use again, I'll lean on the

111
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,500
live coding system that we did here to help us understand what's going

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,800
on.

113
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,300
You know, when we create that, that sort of DP, that sort of velocity

114
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,000
Vector, what we can do now is just kind of beef up our upward motion.

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Ian Wright.

116
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,300
So instead of just between .71 I can, I can really just kind of Jack

117
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,300
that up by adding a little multiplier on the front that just gives

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,400
them more of an upward thing.

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,200
And now you can kind of see how we've got more of a fountain effect

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
going, right?

121
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,800
And I want to talk a little bit more about the

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,300
Effect because I feel like it's important maybe at this point just

123
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,600
when we're talking about it Loosely and again, since these are kind of

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,000
fun days, I want to kind of bring in, you know, we're just kind of

125
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,100
playing around the partisans, getting you interested in them.

126
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,500
I want to bring up a couple things about particle systems that you may

127
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,400
not know, even if you've done Parsons before, or you may not be

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,400
familiar with, if you're not like a physics, some guy or whatever,

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,700
right?

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,600
So I'm going to point out some things there, but before I go into

131
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,400
that, I just take our little Fountain here and say, you know, one of

132
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,700
the things that's not very good about our Fountain is, is

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,800
When these things hit the floor, right?

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,200
When these things you know, collide with the floor they should

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,700
probably bounce right?

136
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,800
And as you know Collision detection is pretty difficult, you know they

137
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,300
we spent some time on it, we solve more stuff, we have to do our

138
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,200
conjectures kind of rudimentary and not really great and so we have

139
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,600
some things.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,200
I said when we want to go do our final pass on that.

141
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,500
We have some more things to do so you know do we can really afford to

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,800
do any kinds of fancy Collision detection on our protocols.

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,500
And the answer is maybe not so much, but just because we can't do

144
00:06:59,500 --> 00:06:59,800
real.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
Good Collision detection are particles, remember particles are about

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,300
doing something fast and cheap, that allows us to create some

147
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,100
interesting phenomena and we can do some things that would allow that

148
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,500
to happen.

149
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,800
So, for example, one thing that would be pretty trivial for us to do

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,700
is just to check to see if we cross below sort of a ground line.

151
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,000
And if we do just Just Bounce ourselves back up, right?

152
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,500
And so, it would be pretty easy to do something like, you know, if

153
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,600
particle P or even, you know, I could even do it in clothes for

154
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,800
Michael.

155
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,600
I'd just say whatever the particles I guess, it was, why is our thing

156
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,000
here?

157
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,000
Absolute value particle.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,900
P that y, so I could say, just don't let that don't let the y-value.

159
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,800
Go - right and you can kind of see how it now.

160
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,900
Does this sort of It, kind of has a nasty nasty vibrating effect for a

161
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,300
reason, which I'll talk about in a second.

162
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,100
But you can kind of see how we can start to put in a fairly cheap

163
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,000
effect, right?

164
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
That will make it so that our particles will kind of land on something

165
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,800
that we really don't want them to.

166
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,700
Have that kind of nasty bouncing effect so it's a couple different

167
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,400
ways we can do that.

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,600
With that bouncing effect is coming from.

169
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,800
If I may go to the Whiteboard or Blackboard I should say, for a

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,400
moment, just to kind of draw it out.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
So you kind of have an idea of what it's going on there.

172
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,700
So what happens when I when I have this bounce situation is the

173
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,300
particle is coming down, right?

174
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,000
And you have to remember, everything is happening in.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,900
It's nothing really happens on a curve in our Graphics of everything

176
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,600
always happens in discrete steps, right?

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:29,800
So,

178
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
It's like here and then it moves to here on the next frame and then it

179
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,100
moves to here on the next frame.

180
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,000
And then it moves to like here on the next frame or whatever.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Right?

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,400
And if the ground is here, if I'm going to negate its position.

183
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,400
So I'm going to take this mountain, flip it back up, right?

184
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,800
You know, that's going to like oscillate this guy very quickly because

185
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
it's going to come here and then grabbed his going to pull them back

186
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,300
down again and he's going to come here and guys can pull back down

187
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,600
again and so on, right?

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,100
So what I'd rather do is something a little bit more, like what we

189
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,800
were doing before where I say, okay, if he goes

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,900
It let's just set him a be projecting back to the point of contact and

191
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,000
maybe just negate his velocity.

192
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,800
So instead he'll bounce and kind of go up, right?

193
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,100
Because remember we did that when we sort of did our stuff there.

194
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,200
So I'm going to do instead is say if the particle p y right is is less

195
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,900
than zero.

196
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,800
Then I'm going to make the particle p y equal to 0

197
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,200
And I'm going to make the particle DP y equal.

198
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,000
Its -.

199
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,300
So I'm just going to flip the direction.

200
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,500
I'm going to, I'm going to bounce it off that that surface right.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,600
And there you can see.

202
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
Now I get kind of a more natural bounce, right?

203
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,100
And, and of course, the other thing I can do is if I wanted to now

204
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,800
that I've taken care of that, velocity problem, and it won't go back

205
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,700
and immediately, I could choose to try and keep some of that momentum

206
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
there by doing something like that as well.

207
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,300
Right?

208
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,400
So now, I can keep that that negation.

209
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,800
That was like,

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
The absolute value of thing we did before.

211
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Right?

212
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,600
So now we've got those bouncing heads, but you'll notice what happens

213
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,900
is they bounce as high as they fell, right?

214
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
And that's actually the physically correct thing to happen.

215
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,500
If you bounce, if you let something go and it bounces off the floor,

216
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,300
its natural physical thing to do, would be to bounce as high as you

217
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,400
dropped it, right?

218
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,200
That's actually what should happen if you were just looking at the

219
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,100
strict equations of motion for the bounce, but the reality is there's

220
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,800
a couple different things.

221
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,300
There's dragged through the air.

222
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,600
Right.

223
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:23,800
So

224
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,900
There's Mo, there's energy being lost their and so that will count for

225
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,300
a little bit.

226
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,000
But what really account for the majority of why something doesn't

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,300
bounce as high as when you originally Drew at that, the height when he

228
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,300
was dropped, it is actually the impact with the thing that it's

229
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,700
hitting.

230
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,800
So if I drop a ball on the floor, the reason it doesn't bounce as high

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,600
as from where I dropped.

232
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,900
It is actually because the there's energy that goes into deforming the

233
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,200
ball and to some very small extent, usually the floor slightly those.

234
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Those atoms as they

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,700
Each other, you know, as they kind of Squish together, there's energy

236
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,100
that's lost in that actual collision and the energy that's lost in the

237
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,300
Collision comes directly out of the energy.

238
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,600
That was the kinetic energy of the ball, that was bouncing, right?

239
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,900
And so, any real ball bouncing, any real floor, will always lose some

240
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,700
amount and that's there's a coefficient what they do to approximate as

241
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,400
they have a thing called a coefficient of restitution, right?

242
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,700
Which is basically just a thing that says

243
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,300
Let's have a number.

244
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,300
The tells us what percentage of the energy we retain after the bounce.

245
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
So we just say, yeah, we're not going to simulate atoms like smashing

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
into each other and losing energy in that and all whatever it is going

247
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,000
to say.

248
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,700
You know what, this thing, loses half of its velocity when it bounces

249
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,000
or something like that, right?

250
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Because we figured it out and that's what it does in the material

251
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,700
science just says, okay, right.

252
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
And all we have to do is just add in that coefficient of restitution

253
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,800
and then we will get a much more natural bounce happening, right?

254
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,700
And you can kind of see those guys bouncing out kind of more

255
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,200
The way that you would expect like with a, like we said, a fountain or

256
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,800
something like that.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,700
I'm gonna kick up the initial kick a little bit.

258
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,200
They're also just so we can have a higher sort of Bounce to it, okay?

259
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
That may have been admit that that may have been excessive.

260
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm going to I'm going to calm that down a little bit, so there you

261
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,500
go.

262
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,300
Right now, we're kind of throwing those guys out a little bit more.

263
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,100
And I feel like maybe the bounce is even still a little bit much,

264
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,700
even, even even with a half.

265
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
So I'm going to take it down even even a little further.

266
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,800
So, there's something that feels a little bit more like, you know, a

267
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
fountain of something.

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Spewing out like it is, right?

269
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,400
And and you know, I'm reasonably happy with that.

270
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,500
And as you can see that's that's not a particularly onerous piece of

271
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
code to, right?

272
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,000
That's pretty trivial.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,100
And we could even do this for some limited.

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,100
Like if we had a very limited cleavage Collision geometry that we were

275
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,700
working with something very simple, we could we could probably do

276
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,500
something with that.

277
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,400
So it wouldn't be too complicated to have a couple things that happen,

278
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
right with these guys.

279
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,200
And so that's, you know, that's kind of, like, the basic thing with,

280
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,900
like, just starting to add a little bit of stuff into the into the

281
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,600
particles there.

282
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Now, what I wanted to talk about, in terms of the, what happens with

283
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,500
the fountain here, there's actually some other things.

284
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,200
I don't really know, you know, if we want to actually try this today,

285
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,200
maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't

286
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
It's such a hard decision.

287
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,900
You know, what do you go for and what do you not go for, right?

288
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,900
I want to I wanted to kind of time to talk about lagrangian versus or

289
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Larry and simulation and just kind of how they differ in what they

290
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:43,600
mean.

291
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,900
And I don't know if we're going to be able to get through it in a

292
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,800
daze, the only thing.

293
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,200
So I'm not sure if I should start talking about if I should save it

294
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
for some other time when we're going to have a longer period discuss

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,200
it, but what the heck it cut, you know, if comes up, it comes up.

296
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,000
So let's just talk about it because I was on my mind.

297
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,800
So what I kind of wanted to point out is like, so let's say we wanted

298
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,700
this fountain.

299
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,200
To you know to look a little bit more like a fountain and one of the

300
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
things that happens with a fountain of stuff right?

301
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,200
Is that the upward velocity there is not so variable, right?

302
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,800
The actual upward velocity and a fountain is in like a month or the

303
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,200
spread the horizontal spread is much narrower, right.

304
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,600
It's a much narrower thing that's happening there and so really, you

305
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,200
know, for a fountain we're talking about something that's really not

306
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,000
going to have that kind of lateral spread to it.

307
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,700
It's a very

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Nozzle, right?

309
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,500
Like you can see that shooting straight up and that's you know what,

310
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,400
we've got there is a much more accurate depiction of a fountain on the

311
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
way up, right?

312
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,400
But if you notice what, if you take a look at what that looks like and

313
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,700
you think about what a fountain actually looks like, right?

314
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Well, our simulation right now.

315
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,600
Looks like something that just kind of comes up here and then comes

316
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
back down, right?

317
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,700
So it kind of creates like a little narrow cylinder, right.

318
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,300
But if you've ever seen a fountain, a fountain has a very distinctive

319
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,800
look.

320
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,200
Any kind of a spray like that as a very distinctive.

321
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,100
Look, when it's got a reversal in its path.

322
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,200
And what happens is, it comes up, right?

323
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,700
And this part is still roughly the same, but it actually then kind of

324
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,100
comes out like this kind of a thing, right?

325
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,400
So it's kind of as an arrow thing coming up here and then it comes out

326
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,800
like this and for

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
seems kind of like a more of a mushroom on the way down.

328
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,100
So the thing is coming down, right?

329
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,000
Are very different from the things that we're going up, right?

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,900
They don't kind of has this this different character to it.

331
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,600
And if you think about why that actually is, that is because these

332
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,100
things are not infinitely.

333
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,000
Compressible typically, what we're simulating, right?

334
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,900
They cannot hold an arbitrary amount of themselves in a given area

335
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
without a consequence.

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,500
And what I mean by that is imagine that you have a glass of water,

337
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:04,800
right?

338
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,200
The typical substance we might make to think about how Fountain looks

339
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
would be say water, right?

340
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,800
So if we have a glass of water, it's a fair bet to say

341
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
That if the glass was filled up to here, right?

342
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
Let's say your glass is half empty, right?

343
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,400
Versus your glasses is full.

344
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,300
However, you want to picture it.

345
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,400
What we know about water, even from our daily, you know, observations

346
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:34,700
of it.

347
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,100
You can understand this very directly because you've seen it all the

348
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,600
time.

349
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,000
The amount of water that is in a glass is directly reflected by how

350
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,800
much volume it takes up, right?

351
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,200
You do not have to ask how squished down the water was in your glass,

352
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,400
to figure out how much water you have, you know, that you have exactly

353
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,100
as much as the volume that you have.

354
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,200
There is no density.

355
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,900
E2 water other than the one density that water has, right?

356
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,000
And that is because it is an incompressible fluid, right?

357
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,900
You cannot just squish it into an area like you might be able to do

358
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,800
with a solid that had air in it.

359
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,200
That could come packed down and become more dense and stay that way.

360
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
Water will not do that, right?

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,700
Water wants to expand to its natural density.

362
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,099
It is an incompressible fluid in that sense, right?

363
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,900
And so when happens with our Fountain is on the way up, when we start

364
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,100
shooting the fountain, everything is kosher because the water has an

365
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,500
upward velocity, that allows it to get out of its way at roughly the

366
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,900
same rate as new water is.

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Coming in.

368
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,100
So the water on the way up is pretty happy but as gravity takes its

369
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,400
toll, the water on the top is going slower and slower and slower until

370
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,000
it stops right.

371
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,900
Eventually that the water that first water that got shot out is going

372
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,300
to slow.

373
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,000
And at the apex of the fountain at the part where it's going to change

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,800
direction, it's basically motionless.

375
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,300
Right?

376
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,500
And so what happens is you've just got this huge amount of water

377
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,800
that's

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,700
Getting into this zone right here, that's going to try and come back

379
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,200
down, but when it starts to try to come back down, there's more water

380
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,400
there.

381
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,000
There's water that was on its way up that it is trying to occupy the

382
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,700
same volume.

383
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,700
And so it's going to happen is as the water kind of comes up in and

384
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,800
tries to, you know, think negotiate with its other water molecules for

385
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,300
how are we going to occupy this space and maintain like a uniform

386
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,900
density?

387
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,000
It starts to push, right, it starts to have outward force.

388
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,100
That is pushing.

389
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,400
Water out of the way new water that's coming in, wants to push other

390
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
water out of the way.

391
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
What if it's falling down wants to push other water out of the way,

392
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,300
right?

393
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,700
So all of those interacts to the molecules is causing an expansion of

394
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,700
the water volume at that point because you're shoving new water into

395
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,100
it.

396
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,800
And the old water is got nowhere to go.

397
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,600
It's got its got to leave, right?

398
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,700
It can't just stay there.

399
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,400
And and to be clear, it's not like new water and old water, are

400
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,100
pushing each other out, or it's more like there's just a collection of

401
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,600
water.

402
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
And as we put more of the

403
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Water molecules in it doesn't matter whether the new ones are the old

404
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,300
ones or whatever are getting pushed out.

405
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Some water molecules are going to get pushed out because we can only

406
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,200
have so many in a certain space, right?

407
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,500
And so if we were doing that in zero gravity somehow, you know, you'd

408
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
expect the expansion to be uniform, but obviously the whole reason,

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,400
this is even happening is because we have gravity, which is slowing

410
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,100
the water down.

411
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,500
And so what happens is you don't see much in the way of water shooting

412
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,400
out these directions, because any water that got pushed upward is

413
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,700
still under the force of gravity and will very soon, find its own path

414
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,700
downward, that does not involve hitting any other water, right?

415
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,700
And so what you end up with is that very characteristic Fountain shape

416
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,300
Of water that comes up and then kind of get splatted outward, you

417
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,000
know, in that way.

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,900
Because outward trajectories will never get pushed anymore.

419
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,300
They'll just kind of be able to naturally fall, right?

420
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,200
And so, if you think about our problem that we have, if we were wanted

421
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,100
to capture this, well we could write some kind of special purpose code

422
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,700
to do this, right?

423
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,200
We could, if we just wanted a fountain and we just only want to

424
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
simulate that you could imagine having some kind of a force that kicks

425
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,700
in.

426
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,900
We just say the there's like a, just, a dispersal thing up here,

427
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,400
right?

428
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,800
That pushes it out and that would be one way that we could fake the

429
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,200
fountain thing, right?

430
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,500
So, let's write that fake one right now.

431
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,000
For I tell you a little bit more about sort of lagrangian, Euler stuff

432
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,100
so that you could kind of see where I'm going with it.

433
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,300
So let's just write that one because you know, it kind of turned into

434
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
a little bit of a talky stream.

435
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,200
All right.

436
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,500
So if we wanted to write that one, what would we do?

437
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,200
Well let's just say that we have at that Apex there.

438
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,700
We've got some kind of a thing that's going to push our water

439
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,000
molecules out, right?

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,600
So we're going to have a thing that's going to push them out.

441
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,700
So what I want to do is say something like and again I kept saying I'm

442
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,800
just writing a super cheesy thing here doing the thing that is the

443
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
effects artists.

444
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Way of getting this done, meaning we're not trying to do physical

445
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,900
simulation, really?

446
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,600
We're just trying to make something looks like a fountain.

447
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,400
So what I'm going to say is if the velocity of the particle has gone -

448
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,200
so it starts its went up and then now it's on its way back down.

449
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,700
I want to make something that just makes those guys kind of poof

450
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,600
outward, right?

451
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,500
I just want them to poof outward a little bit, right?

452
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,400
That's all we're going to do.

453
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,200
So all I'm going to do there is if they're on a downward trajectory,

454
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm going to end and maybe you know will also check to see and you

455
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,700
know they are there within some reasonable bounds.

456
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,300
So you know and Y is greater than some magical constant that we come

457
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,700
up with right and these are going to be these are going to be too kind

458
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,100
of locate where the dispersal thing is going to happen, right?

459
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,900
What we're going to do is we're going to say that whatever their x

460
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,000
velocity was.

461
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,800
It's we are going to maybe magnify or you know what, we'll add a

462
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:07,300
little bit of acceleration to their acceleration based on what the

463
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah.

464
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Bait will add a little bit to their acceleration based on whatever the

465
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,300
they're they're sort of displacement was an ex.

466
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,600
I mean however, far they were from the center line, will add a little

467
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,500
bit of that back in, right?

468
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,400
Least, that's the roof.

469
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,300
There we go.

470
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm kind of wanting to be able to type this in and physics notation,

471
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,200
which doesn't really work.

472
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,800
All right, so let's try that and see if we can get something a little

473
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,200
more sensible there, right?

474
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,900
I actually want to make sure that I do this in a strictly, it's a

475
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,700
vector equation.

476
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,300
So, I got to make that keep happening there.

477
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,200
But all right,

478
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,300
so, let's see, I've got a bunch of stuff that I'm going to have to

479
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,000
tune now.

480
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
I don't really know what these values are actually going to be.

481
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
So let's see that one, we know.

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
So this one's really the only one we have to figure out.

483
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm not really sure which one it should be and I also don't really

484
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,700
know how much the magnitude of this Force should be.

485
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,200
So it's really just again just kind of super tweaking, these things to

486
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,900
see what they might want to be.

487
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,300
So it looks like

488
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,900
It looks like for some reason that steak having more of an effect down

489
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,900
at the bottom which I don't super understand why that is I guess

490
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,200
probably because by the time it gets down there or something like

491
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,300
that.

492
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,600
Let me see if I can restrict that effect to a little bit higher and

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
then maybe make it a little bit bigger.

494
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,100
I wish I knew how high those things were actually going of course is

495
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,000
the thing but I don't.

496
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,500
All right so I'm going to make that Force huge.

497
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,300
There we go.

498
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,800
And so I feel like my py here is wrong.

499
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,100
Wrong.

500
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,000
I feel like it should only be operating at the top but it's clearly

501
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,100
operating at the bottom.

502
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,100
So what did I mess up about that?

503
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,900
Assuming that the velocity is negative and P Y is greater than

504
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,500
One.

505
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,100
So its height above the ground should be greater than 1, right?

506
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Is it that just needs to be much higher or something I guess.

507
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,600
It does look like that was the case, right?

508
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,100
So, I don't know.

509
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,300
Are we now at the point where it can't be added at all?

510
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
It does appear, that way.

511
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah.

512
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,100
So, not particularly good, although I could also make it.

513
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
So we've just hacking the velocity directly

514
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,400
Again, this is all just just randomly stupid hack.

515
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Sorts of things.

516
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,300
Nothing.

517
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,500
I'm doing, literally nothing smart here.

518
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,600
Let's try it that way.

519
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,500
so, maybe 10 x that

520
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Know why?

521
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
I feel like I should be seeing more maybe I'm not thinking about this

522
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,900
quite correctly but that is often the case with hacks when you're just

523
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
trying to figure something out.

524
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,000
It's often not particularly smart what you're doing so it can be kind

525
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,300
of there we go.

526
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,700
So now we're getting a little bit more of that, but it's not really,

527
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
it's not really what I want.

528
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
So I actually maybe want to make it so it's more like this, right?

529
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,900
So it happens on the way up a little bit more there.

530
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's see.

531
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
You know, I could make it sort of only when the Apex happens.

532
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
So you know what I could do?

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
It's more like this.

534
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,700
I could just do it in a balanced of Y, so, but the bounds of velocity.

535
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,000
So, basically, we do something like, you know, if it's in between that

536
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,800
Narrow band.

537
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,300
So it's relatively slow.

538
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,100
You know what I'm saying?

539
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Then we will do, you know, this, this sort of displacement based on

540
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
its Exposition or whatever you want to do, just.

541
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
So in that, very narrow band, right?

542
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,000
And I don't know if that maybe would make it a little bit better.

543
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah.

544
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,100
So of course at the bottom, that's a problem.

545
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,700
Oh, right?

546
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,400
Because at the bottom, it will also have that velocity Man packs are

547
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,700
hard.

548
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,200
This is why this is why it's difficult to hack things.

549
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,800
And I often try to just do them the right way because man, trying to

550
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,200
come up with little things like this, that do the sorts of stuff that

551
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
you want is not always, is not always easy.

552
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,200
It ends up being like, you know, this kind of War of Attrition where

553
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,100
you let go and then maybe I can hack this on the thing.

554
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,800
On top of it.

555
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
So it tends to be a little bit nicer to just do the right thing.

556
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,700
So that's looking a little bit more looking a little bit better but

557
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,000
only a little bit, right?

558
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Like it's not still not quite there yet, right?

559
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,300
But it's, but it's getting a little better, right?

560
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,300
It's getting a little better.

561
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,200
So let's see.

562
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Maybe maybe a little more.

563
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,900
So if it's in between

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,800
In these two.

565
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,500
So it's relatively low velocity.

566
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,500
So if it's less than three up, I'm going to make it so that it, maybe

567
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,500
we'll let it do a little bit more there.

568
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,300
Right.

569
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,000
So that's looking a little bit better.

570
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
And you can sort of start to see that a little bit.

571
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,100
I think another one of the problems is that it's just hard to, it's

572
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,900
just hard to take the sort of that narrow band and spread it out

573
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,300
enough.

574
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,800
So you almost need to add some entropy into them at the top there in

575
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,100
order to get it to happen but you know you know how it is.

576
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,600
Alright.

577
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,000
So if I were to then say narrow this down even a little bit more.

578
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
So let's say that the upward velocity is hardly jittered in any real

579
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,800
way.

580
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,300
So

581
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,300
Upward velocity is like very straightforward, right?

582
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,400
And then we've kind of got, you know, maybe even a narrow stream.

583
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,300
So it's a very stable stream kind of going upwards, right?

584
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,400
And then we go ahead and kind of Jack that that spreading effect up

585
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,700
there, right?

586
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,500
Let's see, that's starting to that's actually starting to look a

587
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
little bit better, right?

588
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,000
But it's just kind of a little disquieting.

589
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,500
I don't know, I don't know if maybe the if acceleration would, it

590
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,900
would be calmer or

591
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,000
Her as well.

592
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,700
Yeah.

593
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't know, I'm not sad, I'm not very happy with this.

594
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,800
It's not doing it for me.

595
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,300
I don't know if that's just because I want to do the right thing or if

596
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,800
it's just because I'm not doing a particularly good job at hacking it

597
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
today, right?

598
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,500
The point being either.

599
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,100
This is a good demonstration of why you should care about the thing.

600
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm about to talk about next.

601
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,500
Or maybe if you're good at hacking stuff, maybe if you're better at

602
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,600
like hacking stuff than I am, you won't have a problem and you'll just

603
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,400
come up with something that you know, that that's that's reasonable

604
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,000
right?

605
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,900
So yeah.

606
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,500
So let me tell you a little bit about what I was going to say in terms

607
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,100
of how you actually want to solve these problems, typically

608
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,000
If you can, if you can afford it and sometimes you can't afford it and

609
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,200
then you're back to doing what I was just doing where you're like,

610
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,200
well, set aside a couple hours and figure out how you're going to hack

611
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,200
something to, you know, make it work, right?

612
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,100
So let's talk about this for a second.

613
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,400
So why are we having the problem that we're having, right?

614
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,600
With the original simulation, which was relatively phase the correct.

615
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,500
It's a bunch of particles that are being simulated by Newton's, you

616
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,300
know standard love of Newtonian motion, right?

617
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,000
Newtonian Dynamics.

618
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,900
So why are we having this problem?

619
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
Well, the reason we're having this problem is because all of the

620
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
particles are just separate entities right there, not at all being

621
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,800
considered.

622
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,900
So, what we actually,

623
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
We would do, right?

624
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
Is when we have this upward stream of particles.

625
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,400
And we start having a collection of particles that are sort of

626
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,600
occupying, the space, and these ones are coming down, and these are

627
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,400
coming up and we now have a high density of particles of the space,

628
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,000
right?

629
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,900
If we actually sat there and said, oh, for every particle, when we're

630
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,400
going to simulate the particle, let's go collect all of the other

631
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,300
particles that are in the nearby region.

632
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,700
See how many there are.

633
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,800
And if there are too many, we will consider that there to be a force

634
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,800
that repels this particle away from these other ones.

635
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,600
Right.

636
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,100
You can imagine this happening, right?

637
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,400
So we could do that, right?

638
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,300
But it would just be incredibly expensive because it means.

639
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,600
Now, we have these big queries to do for each individual particle,

640
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,100
right?

641
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,500
Well, it turns out that physical simulation on computers like physics,

642
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
simulation, right?

643
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,300
The actual not the kind that we do in games where we're trying to

644
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,100
approximate things for visual effects, but I mean like real physical

645
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,300
simulation for like engineering and stuff.

646
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,100
Actually, considers two ways of stimulating things to like broad

647
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,700
categories of simulating things because of this very problem, and they

648
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,300
are called, or larian.

649
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,200
Methods.

650
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,500
And lagrangian methods.

651
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,100
And they're kind of, they're very separated in some sense.

652
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,800
They're kind of a very different and what we are doing right now is

653
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,800
What's called the lagrangian method and what distinguishes, a

654
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,200
lagrangian method is, when you have the information about what you are

655
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,000
simulating,

656
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,200
Is actually the thing that moves through the configuration space,

657
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,600
right?

658
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,900
So we are talking about a real, you know, our simulation space is like

659
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,200
this XYZ thing, right?

660
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,900
And of course, we have this weird.

661
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,000
Why is up thing at the moment because that's how our renderer is built

662
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,700
temporarily.

663
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,200
So we have this sort of situation where we've got a three dimensional

664
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,300
space and we have some information about this.

665
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,400
The thing we're simulating and what we've chosen to do is encapsulate,

666
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,700
the information about the simulation space into these particles and

667
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,400
the particles themselves which are the things that hold the

668
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,900
information and are the and are the even more than just hold the

669
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,300
information.

670
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,200
They are the locations at which we do our simulation, right?

671
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,900
We think about I'm now stimulating at this point and I'm going to move

672
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,600
it to this new point, right?

673
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,400
Those simulation points are actually moving through the space.

674
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,400
They are actually there.

675
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,300
The actual quantities of simulation are themselves, evolving through

676
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,700
the space, right?

677
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,900
And there's another way that you could choose to think about this

678
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,100
problem, right?

679
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,400
Another way we could choose to go, this problem is in what's called an

680
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,700
oral Aryan, or as an oral or larian method thinking about it in terms,

681
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Alms of things that are stationary.

682
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,000
So instead of this, we could think of it differently.

683
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,100
We could think of it as a discretize grid, right?

684
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,800
In space.

685
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:19,600
Like so where our Fountain starts here and it is producing particles

686
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,300
of a velocity that are upwards.

687
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,700
But instead of considering them as particles what we instead, consider

688
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,800
them as what we can said, consider them to be is just a density, right

689
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,900
there is just a density and velocity at this location.

690
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,700
So if I was to spawn five particles, let's say and I was, you know,

691
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,500
their average upward velocity was going to be something like, you

692
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,600
know,

693
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,200
Two meters per second, right?

694
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,100
Then this cell of the grid would simply store five and two, right?

695
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,100
And two meters per second, write five particles 2 meters per second.

696
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,700
And instead of ever even having particles at all, we would just have

697
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
this storage of the grid and the storage would be fixed.

698
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,500
It would be how everybody it is.

699
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,699
I 1 2 3 4 5 6, 1 2 3 4 5 right it would be a six.

700
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,300
By five array that stores that quantity per grid cell.

701
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,400
And what we would do every frame is we would simulate each grid cell

702
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,600
forward in time but they would not move instead.

703
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,300
What they would do is they would broadcast

704
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Their quantities throughout the simulation.

705
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,699
And there's a lot of different ways you can do this obviously.

706
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,900
And this is a whole branch of simulation.

707
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,900
But basically what would happen is there would be equations that we

708
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,100
would solve or send, you know, simulation steps.

709
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,199
We would take depending on how we want to write it, that would take

710
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,900
the values in all the cell's and try to determine what the next set

711
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,300
of.

712
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,600
What the, what the future time values of those cells would be for our

713
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,000
next time step, right?

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,900
So one thing we might say is well if there's a lot of particles, if

715
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,600
the density is high and the velocity is upward here then we should

716
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,300
have you know, our equations should add.

717
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,800
Particles to this cell, right?

718
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,700
I mean, that's what would happen, right?

719
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,600
And if that became true, then later, this one would get more, right?

720
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,100
And this each cell would kind of add density.

721
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,500
Basically two neighboring cells by virtue of the fact that it sees

722
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,400
that the velocity should go forward, right?

723
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:30,100
And there's many ways of solving this weirdly enough, there's a boil

724
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,300
Aryan is, you might as well not even call stuff I Larry and because

725
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,000
we're those guys name on so much stuff.

726
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,000
I mean for that matter, I guess so does l'orange that half the time

727
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
you say the word doesn't even matter.

728
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,300
It's like although which of the twenty or other things we talking

729
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,800
about.

730
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,300
But in the specific case of talking about physical simulation, if you

731
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,700
said or Larry and Method versus lagrangian method, the person would

732
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,000
probably know what you were talking about, right?

733
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,300
They'd be like okay I see you're moving like particles through Spirit,

734
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,700
moving simulation through space or you've got to fix simulation grid

735
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,800
and you're moving quantities through the grid right?

736
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,500
And so, the reason I bring this up is because you can see how the

737
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,900
lagrangian method falls down be at certain things, which are about

738
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,000
density, right?

739
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,800
Lagrangian methods are very bad at handling density, because density

740
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,800
is about how much stuff exists per unit volume.

741
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,100
And the lagrangian method doesn't even have a notion of volume volume

742
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,000
has to be imposed on top of a lagrangian method.

743
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,900
So when you're

744
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,700
Going to go do a lagrangian method that has to take account of

745
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,100
volumetric forces.

746
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
You're constantly at a disadvantage.

747
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,200
Doesn't mean you can't do it, right?

748
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,800
It just means you're at a disadvantage and soy larian methods.

749
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
Have the opposite problem.

750
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,100
They have the opposite strength and the opposite problems basically.

751
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,900
They're, they're complementary schemes.

752
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,900
What happens in an oil, Aryan method is things that have to do with

753
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,600
volume are very, very easy, right?

754
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,900
Because we've already said that everything exists in these nice little

755
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,300
bounds.

756
00:36:59,500 --> 00:36:59,900
So if we

757
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Talk about the fact that if things get too dense they repel.

758
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,700
Well, that's really simple.

759
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,700
We just go, what's the density in this area?

760
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,000
If it's high, it needs to try and spread its density out.

761
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,800
So basically it's like look at two cells if the density gradient, you

762
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
know, if this one is higher than this one then it means it should flow

763
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,600
this way.

764
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,200
If the density here is higher than here it means it should flow that

765
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,600
way right?

766
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,700
It's really simple.

767
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,700
And even without even showing you how to do it you can imagine in your

768
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,300
head having a 2d array and going you know even the totally crap hacked

769
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:28,900
version of that.

770
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,800
It's like just looking at the

771
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,100
Cells.

772
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,800
Which ones greater or smaller.

773
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,000
And just moving some density from one to the other, right?

774
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,800
I mean, you, you can even imagine doing that.

775
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,100
That's not exactly how you'd want to do it, but you can imagine it.

776
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,500
Okay.

777
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,300
So why do I bring this up?

778
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,100
Well I bring this up because if you add these two guys together and

779
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,000
have them make a little love.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,100
Child flipper baby.

781
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,900
Right.

782
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,300
You get you know these kind of mixed methods.

783
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
Which can try to combine the two schemes, right?

784
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,500
And so, how would that work?

785
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,800
You know, how would we use that?

786
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
And of course we've got, I don't know, 20 minutes left.

787
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,300
So the answer of how it would work is like I said, I probably will run

788
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,400
out of time before I could actually Implement one because there's a

789
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
bunch of stuff we have to do there or whatever, but the point being

790
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,700
If you imagine how these things would, would combine together, you can

791
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,000
start to see how we might be able to use both scheme simultaneously to

792
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,400
produce an interesting effect, right?

793
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,700
So, let's suppose that, instead of using the or larian method for

794
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,500
everything, we use the lagrangian method like we're using now, but we

795
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,100
use the alerian method as an intermediate to try and get some of these

796
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,900
volumetric effects happening, right?

797
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,400
So, for example, if we were to do something like I have a lagrangian

798
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,000
method, the lagrangian method is shooting these particles up, right?

799
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
And now I want to know if somewhere.

800
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,800
Kind of bout.

801
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,400
I want to sort of introduce like some forces based on where they Bunch

802
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:04,600
up.

803
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,600
So when these things started start bunching up, I can poop, I can put

804
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,700
them out, right?

805
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,700
I can, I can make them start to disperse.

806
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,300
Well, what I could do is say, okay, I've got the particle system as we

807
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,900
have it now.

808
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,100
But first, before I do the simulation on the particle system or maybe

809
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,800
after depending how I want to interview the steps.

810
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,800
I am going to take a grid, right?

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,800
And I'm going to sum up

812
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
The quantities.

813
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,500
I might be using in an oil Aryan situation from the lagrangian, right?

814
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,600
So the lagrangian frame is here, the or Larry and frame is here.

815
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,200
The lagrangian frame says, here's all my points.

816
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,500
So what I'm going to do is just compute the density, so, the density

817
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,100
is like, really high here, right?

818
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm just going to add for every grid cell.

819
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm just going to add an account, the particles, every particle that's

820
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,900
are going to add it in, right?

821
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,900
You know, so I've got like 20 here and there's a 2 here.

822
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,600
2 here, 3 here, 2 here, 1 here, something like that.

823
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,000
Right, I'm going to do that.

824
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,300
And then what I'm going to do is, I'm going to do some kind of an

825
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,000
update step on the grid to see which cells are high density.

826
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,400
I could even decide if I was super cheese ball.

827
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,900
I don't even have to do that.

828
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,800
I could just just do the sum.

829
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,300
And then what I could do is say, well, when I go to do my simulation,

830
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,100
now my

831
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,600
Step, which is going to update these guys and move these guys

832
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
somewhere, right?

833
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,800
Instead of just updating the particle in isolation using the

834
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,000
techniques we just did, which are the kind of lagrangian way to

835
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
simulate it forwards in time, moving the point through, I'm going to

836
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,400
do an oral Aryan style, look up and say what's the the stationary

837
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:51,500
density at this point and if that density is high, I will, you know,

838
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,500
introduce a velocity that moves

839
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Of things from high-density to low densities.

840
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,500
So for example, maybe what I'll do is I'll take this cell and I'll

841
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,800
subtract the density of this cell from it.

842
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,900
And based on the gradient, I will add in a velocity this way or

843
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,800
acceleration this way.

844
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,200
I'll do the same thing here, I'll do the same thing.

845
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,000
Here to produce a final comment, like composite velocity or

846
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
acceleration that I add in as like an oil, Aryan term to my lagrangian

847
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,100
update, right?

848
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,600
And so that way, I can sort of do something where I

849
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,700
Do allow my particles to be considered as density.

850
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,000
Groups being a kind of relatively clean way.

851
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
That doesn't really hack it, right?

852
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,000
It doesn't really force it to be about a fountain.

853
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,800
We could do anything we want here, where we have, you know, particles

854
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,600
spraying around and where they happen to, you know, where the spray

855
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
happens to concentrate.

856
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,300
They will you notice verse from there or whatever, right?

857
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,500
So, you can kind of see how you can start to construct a more

858
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,000
physically accurate, part of the system, out of this without really,

859
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,300
having to do N squared Loops.

860
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
Because that's the real problem in the

861
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Ron G and right.

862
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,300
The real problem lagrangian is if I have to consider other particles,

863
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:09,500
what I could talk about one particle that ends up in a row N squared

864
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:09,800
land.

865
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,100
Right?

866
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,200
We have n particles and if each one of those n particles has to think

867
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,000
about all the other end particles that's n times n.

868
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,000
And that's a very bad run time for a particle Loop because n is going

869
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,100
to be high, right?

870
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,200
If we want four thousand particles, well, now we've got four thousand

871
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,600
times, four thousand things to consider, and that's no good.

872
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
Instead of what we'd rather do is say we've got four thousand

873
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
particles, right, and we've got

874
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,600
You know, some fixed number of 64 grid squares.

875
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,100
So now we know that we're four thousand times 64.

876
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,100
And we don't even if we drive this number up, this number gets no

877
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,000
worse, right?

878
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,300
We can have eight thousand particles.

879
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,700
This number still gets no worse, right?

880
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,700
Instead of the N squared minus where as we drive, the particle count

881
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,300
high, you know, this this becomes a disaster because it's 8,000 times

882
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,900
eight thousand or whatever, right?

883
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,700
So hopefully that makes some sense.

884
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,800
What does that look like in practice like I said, it's almost it's

885
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,500
completely unlikely that I'll be able to do anything remotely

886
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,400
resembling a mixed method.

887
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,400
Integration scheme here questions, education to my mix method physical

888
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,500
for stimulation but you know what would it look like?

889
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,700
Well it would look like something like this particle cell.

890
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,200
Right?

891
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,600
And in the particle cell, we just have something like density for now.

892
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,400
Right?

893
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,200
Density.

894
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,900
And you know what?

895
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,100
We probably have a velocity, right?

896
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,400
And and maybe I guess we'd have velocity times density, actually,

897
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,700
would be what we'd have, write something like that.

898
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,300
So, you know, as it comes in, we would get that sort of, we could

899
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,800
normalize the velocity out.

900
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,900
So something like this, right?

901
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,300
And what we would say is when we have our particle system, we would

902
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,600
then have our protocol cell, right?

903
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,700
And our protocol cell would be, you know, a two-dimensional array that

904
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,900
again, tries to capture this thing.

905
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,900
Who knows what it is?

906
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,000
It's 16 by 16.

907
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Let's say I'm not sure and then we would go in and do exactly what I

908
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,700
just said on the Blackboard which I could.

909
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,800
I said it's just a lot of code so you know.

910
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,700
Can we do it in a day in 50 minutes and a long day?

911
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,300
Probably not.

912
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,900
But you know, it's something like that.

913
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,700
So so we have something where we'd do, you know?

914
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,200
I don't know.

915
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,300
You know, X is zero.

916
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,600
X is less than 16 + 16 x, right?

917
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,900
Uther y equals 0 Y is less than

918
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:34,800
15 and this is really, you know, define particle, seldom something

919
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,200
like that so that we don't have to have a magic constant strewn

920
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:38,700
everywhere.

921
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,600
We can change easily, something like that, you know, we do this,

922
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,400
right?

923
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,900
And maybe I'll do it quick this way.

924
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
We do this, and we say particle cells.

925
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,800
Write YX.

926
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,500
We're going to clear it.

927
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,400
Clear it out, right?

928
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,000
We just want to be zeroed first, although I guess now, I think about

929
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,900
we wouldn't have to do that in the

930
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,100
We could just say 0, right?

931
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,700
We could just we could just zero that because they're all going to be

932
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
at you know, we know that there's no special values that have to that

933
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,900
it has to be initialized to.

934
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,400
So we could just say, you know what, go ahead 0 the whole thing,

935
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,300
right?

936
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,300
So we can do that.

937
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,300
And then what we want to do here is we would want to be able to do

938
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,600
that summation like I said, right?

939
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,000
So we want to figure out where all the particles are at the moment and

940
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,600
then we want to add that kind of force in instead, right?

941
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,900
So we know it's all 0 now.

942
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,900
So we're going to do in here is we're going to run through the

943
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,100
particles once taking their locations and putting them in, right?

944
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,700
So it's a little bit again.

945
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,300
You do, you don't pay N squared, but you do pay like a second pass for

946
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,000
example, because you've got to compute that grid first

947
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,400
What we could do.

948
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,700
There's yet another way we could do it which is you compute the Grid

949
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,500
on the previous pass.

950
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:56,300
So we can actually get rid of this and have a one frame lag in the

951
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,500
past.

952
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,000
There's there's all these other things we can do, but I don't want to

953
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,800
get too complicated.

954
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
I don't want to throw too much down just yet.

955
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,400
So let's just do it in separate pass first.

956
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,000
Right?

957
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:07,600
So what I would do here is I just need to know which cell I'm in,

958
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,400
right?

959
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,900
I just need to know for the game state for whatever the particle cells

960
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,600
are I just want to know which of these cells, I'm actually going to

961
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,500
land in.

962
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,900
So I'm going to say

963
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,300
Cell cell equals, you know, whatever this cell is.

964
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,800
And we'll figure out how to compute that wire next in a second.

965
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,000
So when I have that sell, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take

966
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,200
again, we've got the density, they're going to take the density and

967
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,300
I'm going to add our, whatever our density is to it.

968
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,800
And for now we'll just say that the density of every particle is one

969
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,900
but we could have particles that are like more or less dense.

970
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,900
And then I'm going to say the velocity times density is just going to

971
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,200
be equal to whatever our particles velocity.

972
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,400
It was going to be right times, whatever are particles.

973
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,800
Density was right.

974
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,700
So we're basically summing up those two things.

975
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,400
And what that means is that now

976
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,000
When we go to look at the cell, we know what the average velocity was

977
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,300
weighted by density in that area, right?

978
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,700
Because we can go ahead and divide.

979
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,000
We could take the density and divide out the velocity times the

980
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,100
density to find out what the average velocity was.

981
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,400
Right.

982
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,700
That makes sense.

983
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,800
So yeah so we could do something crazy like that and this would give

984
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,300
us a cell to sample from if only we knew the Y and X right?

985
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,300
But that's pretty easy.

986
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,900
We've done stuff like this a bunch of times before, right?

987
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,700
You've seen us take things that were not on grids and stick them into

988
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,600
grids, right?

989
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:43,800
And so all we really need to know is where the the base of the grid it

990
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,100
like how to basically map our coordinate space onto the grid.

991
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,300
So I'm just going to take

992
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Arbitrary thing and say you know, okay the base of the grid is is

993
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,600
going to be at like you know maybe - 50 or something, right?

994
00:47:59,700 --> 00:47:59,800
You know.

995
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,900
Here's where our fountains sprays things out of right.

996
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,200
So maybe it's negative 50 or something like that.

997
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,600
And this is going to go out to, you know, or I shouldn't say negative

998
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,300
5 because it was 16 or something, right?

999
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,300
So it's negative 80, or - the the span / to, right?

1000
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,100
So it's out there somewhere and then this is going to go to 80 and

1001
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,400
then this up here would be, you know, 8 comma 16 and this would be

1002
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,500
negative 8 comma 16, right?

1003
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,100
And so all we really have to do is take the position of the particle,

1004
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:28,800
right?

1005
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:29,900
And turn.

1006
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,200
Turn it into an integer and stuck.

1007
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,400
It s of the grid, that'd be fine, right?

1008
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
Because again, we're just, we're not trying to do anything,

1009
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,100
particularly fancy hear it, you know, nothing nothing, particularly

1010
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,700
weird, just something basic.

1011
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,900
So, what I want to do is I want to do a round.

1012
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,800
So I can just kind of see or actually, I guess I want to a truncate to

1013
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,000
put it into a cell it's probably a little more reasonable.

1014
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,600
So we have those that we've done multiple times.

1015
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,600
We've got our truncate so all this truncated right?

1016
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,200
Well the particle

1017
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,300
Well, it sucks to be P, right?

1018
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,800
Particle.

1019
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,600
Dot X and the particle .y.

1020
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,800
Now each particle.

1021
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,800
Its position is pretty much the exact thing we want.

1022
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,600
Only, it's offset by a little bit because remember our grid, our grid

1023
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,100
doesn't start at 8:00 as far as the particles are concerned.

1024
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
It actually starts over here.

1025
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,200
So all we really need to do is just first compute.

1026
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,300
What the P would be if we subtracted the origin of the grid, right?

1027
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,300
So we have the grid origin here and that's a really easy thing for us

1028
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,800
to figure out, right?

1029
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,600
Because like I said, only the x is really different.

1030
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,800
Everything else is the same.

1031
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,500
We've got.

1032
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,100
whatever this particle seldom here is, we just need to go ahead and

1033
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,300
say, okay, yeah, the particle sell dim

1034
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:56,300
We're just going to do - half of that.

1035
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,100
So we're so that way it's kind of centered around X.

1036
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,400
So that's our good origin.

1037
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,600
This will do all the summing and the only thing that we really have to

1038
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,900
do now is make sure that we clamp these guys to something reasonable,

1039
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,600
right?

1040
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,400
So if x is less than 0, it equals 0, right?

1041
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,300
If x is greater than that particle seldom, right?

1042
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,800
We need to to truncate that down.

1043
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,400
Like so right and the same thing would be true for y.

1044
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,400
So now we know we're always in.

1045
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,600
We're always in the cell.

1046
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,400
And we could also, after we do this scale, this guy.

1047
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,900
So if we wanted to scale the grid, we could do that too which is, you

1048
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,900
know, it's pretty easy.

1049
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,200
So, again, if we were doing this for reals, we think about more about

1050
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,300
how the grid has to get overlaid and all these are the sorts of

1051
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,800
things.

1052
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,900
But for now, that seems pretty reasonable.

1053
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,500
And that should sum up, that should like get our grid going just fine,

1054
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,000
right?

1055
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,200
Of course, we can't, that's going to change the data layout, so I got

1056
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,500
to rerun the program, right?

1057
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,400
And so now, we're actually Computing those grid values and, and that's

1058
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:57,900
all fine.

1059
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,200
We probably need to draw.

1060
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,900
Owe them a little bit.

1061
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,400
In order to kind of see what's going on.

1062
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,700
But you know what, that even even that is not particularly difficult,

1063
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,200
right?

1064
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,900
We could we could pretty easily just do a push wrecked here where we

1065
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,800
actually draw out what our grid looks like right.

1066
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,300
And so what I could do is say, okay, I'm going to do a quick spin just

1067
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,400
for our own like edification, right?

1068
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,200
So we can see it.

1069
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,100
I'm gonna do a quick spin over this grid right over the grid just so

1070
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,000
we can kind of see you know what we're even.

1071
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,500
In here.

1072
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,000
So I'll do that.

1073
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,000
I'll go ahead and say that will spin over the grid.

1074
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,300
Right.

1075
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:47,700
And yeah, and as we do that, I'm going to go ahead and pull out that

1076
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:53,400
particle cell and then I'm going to draw a rectangle that's is that's

1077
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,900
going to be centered, our I guess is going to show us the grid

1078
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:02,300
location and is going to maybe be colored based on the density, let's

1079
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,900
say of what's there again.

1080
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,500
I got about 10 minutes left on the clock.

1081
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,800
So I'll just or I don't even know if I think it's something like, 10

1082
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,400
minutes, 78 minutes, something like that.

1083
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,700
So I will go to about 60.

1084
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,100
It.

1085
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,800
So if I want to do that, right, I know that it's again, just x + y,

1086
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,100
nothing particularly fancy there but it's offset by that grid origin,

1087
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,000
right?

1088
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,800
And so whatever the grid origin is we need to add that in, okay?

1089
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,800
And the other thing that we need to do is recognize that this

1090
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
dimension thing here.

1091
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,800
We know that we're drawing something that's like that, but the problem

1092
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,400
is, I believe this was centered the way that we draw our Rex, right?

1093
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,700
We really need to like lock down the red or sometime soon in.

1094
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,500
Document it so that we know how our stuff works.

1095
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,700
So we don't have to keep looking at some point.

1096
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,100
That's, that's yeah, that's a good idea to do.

1097
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:55,300
Let's say, so anyway, but if we push wrecked here, I just want to see

1098
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,200
which one we do.

1099
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,800
So there's the offset and the dim.

1100
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,300
So it looks like scale times gym, so it's actually going to be up in

1101
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,200
the actual code.

1102
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,100
It looks like we're it.

1103
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,300
Does that displacement?

1104
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,100
So there's rectangle entropy entropy plus dim.

1105
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,500
So no, it's actually corner.

1106
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,200
It's actually corner and, and wit, and with tight.

1107
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,800
So that's that should actually be it, right?

1108
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,200
That should actually be the thing.

1109
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,700
What is this complaining about just these guys?

1110
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,200
We have that.

1111
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,900
All right, now we go.

1112
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,000
All right, so if I go ahead and make this happen, there we go.

1113
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,800
No use running conversion from.

1114
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,300
What are you talking about?

1115
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,200
This is just a B2, is the problem.

1116
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,800
There we go.

1117
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,500
All right.

1118
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,100
And so what I can also do here is I can make the density proportional

1119
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:51,400
to you know I can make I can make a alpha value here, right?

1120
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,200
Which is going to be like, clamp 0 to 1, whatever the density of this

1121
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,400
thing is and maybe we say that it's like, you know,

1122
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,800
No, it's a tenth of the particle count.

1123
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,900
Being like that, right?

1124
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,400
So we're just going to want to just kind of get brighter based on how

1125
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,900
many particles are in that cell or something.

1126
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,400
Just so we can see if this is working at all, right?

1127
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,700
So let's go ahead and okay, that great is way too big.

1128
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,800
First of all, I guess that makes sense because each grid cells and M.

1129
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,700
So let's start by by calming that down a bit.

1130
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,300
So we'll let's introduce a grid scale, right?

1131
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,000
And the grid scale should maybe be you know 0.2 or something.

1132
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Something a little bit more coherent there.

1133
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,800
Right.

1134
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,000
And so what I want to do now is I want to say that we got the grid

1135
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,400
scale times that, you know, just to kind of shrink things down

1136
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,000
properly.

1137
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
And so that does mean.

1138
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,100
Also that these values have to be multiplied by the grid scale as

1139
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,100
well, right?

1140
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
When we're drawing it.

1141
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,600
And similarly, this would also be multiplied by the grid scale rights

1142
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,200
because we're sort of shrinking everything down a little bit, right?

1143
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:02,200
Okay, that is not right.

1144
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,200
And the reason is because this of course, also needs to be scaled by

1145
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,100
the grid scale.

1146
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,600
If that makes sense, because it's going to be too far away right now,

1147
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
it's being moved as if there was no grid scale.

1148
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,500
So the the actual origin has to be computed knowing that that's how

1149
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,600
far it's actually going to go per step as well, right?

1150
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,400
Alright, so there we go so that's looking roughly, right?

1151
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,200
But are we're not getting the right density, calculation there at all

1152
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,200
as far as I can tell.

1153
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,100
So let's feel, let's figure out what's happening there.

1154
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,100
Why is that?

1155
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,300
Why is that not working properly density cell density, plus equals

1156
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,300
sell that?

1157
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,700
Why is that bad?

1158
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,600
Looks reasonable.

1159
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,900
And yet it is apparently not reasonable.

1160
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,900
Yeah, I don't know.

1161
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,400
I'm going to also I'm going to do

1162
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,800
this instead just to make sure that I don't have any weird things

1163
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,800
happening with Alpha.

1164
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,300
Yeah, that's just totally wrong.

1165
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,300
Well, that's okay.

1166
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,900
Let's step in.

1167
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,200
Got a few minutes left, you never know, this could still work.

1168
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,700
You never know.

1169
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,100
If you could get something in before the end of the stream, always

1170
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:37,800
kind of tricky.

1171
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,700
All right, so let's scoot on back here, too.

1172
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,400
Where is that?

1173
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,800
Particle fun.

1174
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,100
It is right here.

1175
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,400
Alright so let's come in here.

1176
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,200
And let's see.

1177
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
What we tend to get for X and Y values.

1178
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,800
Okay, well that's not helpful.

1179
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,500
What is going on there?

1180
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,000
oh,

1181
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
Okay yeah, wow.

1182
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:25,800
So obviously the idea here right is to scale you we want to map things

1183
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,100
into the space of the grid.

1184
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,100
So what I did here was I actually made the problem worse, right?

1185
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,200
I multiply by the grid scale, which will shrink the values.

1186
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,400
I want to make the values larger so that they move into more grid

1187
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,900
right spaces, right?

1188
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,500
If our grid, you know, if here is our X, you know, here's our origin

1189
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,700
right here, 0 0, and I've got a particle, right?

1190
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,300
And it's

1191
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,700
You know, it's going to the value like .7, you know, point three or

1192
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,900
something, right?

1193
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,600
If I want the grid to be smaller.

1194
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,200
So the grid is like point to on a side or something.

1195
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,200
If I want to know what grid Square, This falls into the last thing I

1196
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,400
want to do is make this value smaller.

1197
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,100
This value needs to be bigger because it needs to fall into three,

1198
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,600
right?

1199
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,500
So, I'm really supposed to be using one over the grid square, right?

1200
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,900
I'm trying to figure out where it actually Maps.

1201
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,100
We've done this before on the stream, multiple times.

1202
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,900
I just yeah.

1203
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,900
Italy space, right?

1204
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,400
So I actually need to know the inverse of the grid scale so that I can

1205
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,800
map it that properly.

1206
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,000
And that's actually what I, what I actually wanted their right.

1207
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,200
So that was just being stupid.

1208
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,800
So let's try that one more time.

1209
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,500
Okay, so now you can see a little bit better.

1210
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,400
What's going on?

1211
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,700
Of course, our heads are offset, which doesn't help.

1212
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:49,500
So we should probably use something that's actually centered, but it's

1213
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,200
kind of cool, right?

1214
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,400
You can kind of see that.

1215
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,700
Now we kind of know what the density is everywhere.

1216
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,400
And if I go ahead and make it draw after the fact, we can see it a

1217
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,300
little more clearly.

1218
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:01,700
Oops.

1219
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,700
Right?

1220
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,200
So there you go and so you can kind of see where the densities are.

1221
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,100
You can kind of see where they where they're sort of adding up.

1222
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,700
And so if we wanted to now, we could sort of have things that make

1223
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,300
them dispersed based on those densities.

1224
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:26,200
Yeah, so it's a little bit confusing to watch because as you're seeing

1225
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,900
it, you're seeing kind of not the true answer because this is the this

1226
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,400
is what the densities are without the fact that when they get to the

1227
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,700
top, they would start to disperse.

1228
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,000
So this part is going to be brighter than it should be because

1229
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,800
everything falls.

1230
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,900
Straight back down onto it, right?

1231
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,300
Which is not actually correct.

1232
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
But yeah, there you go.

1233
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,600
So,

1234
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
That is the start of a scheme, but we don't really have time to do

1235
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,700
anything anymore.

1236
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,500
Fancy with that, right?

1237
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,400
Because of well, because of the

1238
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,200
Lateness of the hour, shall we say?

1239
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,200
But what we would do is we would do the exact same thing in here,

1240
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:07,600
right?

1241
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,500
We would, we would probably we would pull this code out into something

1242
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,600
common, right?

1243
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,600
But then we would do you know exactly the same thing here, where we

1244
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,900
grab out whatever the cell is for this guy.

1245
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:23,800
And now we can use the cell cells information to do some whatever we

1246
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,100
want to do, right?

1247
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:29,000
And so, for example, even if we just were to take this thing here we

1248
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,100
could instead of doing

1249
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,200
The if statement like we were doing it before now we could actually

1250
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,600
just add something proportional if we wanted to do this thing

1251
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,000
proportional, we just add in the term here for whatever the density

1252
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:39,800
was in that cell.

1253
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,800
So the poofing Factor could now just be based on the cell density.

1254
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:43,900
Right.

1255
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:50,200
And off you go and hey that actually does roughly, what we actually

1256
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,100
wanted it to do.

1257
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:57,500
Of course, we're adding a little bit too much force there to say the

1258
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,100
least, but at least,

1259
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,300
East.

1260
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,200
Now we do have something.

1261
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,800
That's kind of dispersing those guys a little bit better.

1262
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,300
So we have one of the things that we need to do which is that uh no.

1263
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,700
We don't actually cap are like particles that have have gone to

1264
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,300
nothing.

1265
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,100
Don't actually are still counting for everything.

1266
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,100
So we might want to do to just temporarily is say that the particles

1267
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,100
Alpha since that's our kind of Life Time factor is is what the density

1268
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,700
actually would be there, right?

1269
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So now, you don't

1270
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,800
Have those ones that are kind of fading out don't actually count for

1271
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,700
for any kind of, you know, for any kind of a density Factor, right?

1272
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,200
So, yeah, so if we wanted to play around with that a bit, now we could

1273
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,200
actually try playing around with some forces there.

1274
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Of course, it's a little bit confusing because we don't have, since we

1275
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,100
haven't done work on the grid which is the important step of the rural

1276
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:53,900
area in part.

1277
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,400
We don't know what direction to shoot particles.

1278
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,000
We don't know how to move particles in any particular way.

1279
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,200
So it's kind of bogus and this is never going to produce anything,

1280
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,600
particularly interesting, but point being, you can see that we're kind

1281
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,200
of getting a start to it, where we can sort of start to get it, where

1282
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,100
things are kind of, you know, moving away from from where they should

1283
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,600
move away from.

1284
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,900
But of course, we also have things where they'll yeah, you can see

1285
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,400
them kind of bouncing off the things there and and part of that is

1286
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,300
just what happens when you get to the edge of the grid.

1287
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,900
Now I could expand the grid out a little bit, just to, you know, sort

1288
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:28,200
of prolong the bad or keep the Badness a little bit, a little bit less

1289
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,100
problematic.

1290
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,000
Again because we're still because we're not solving what the density

1291
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,400
says, you should do because we need to look at like neighboring cells.

1292
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,200
It's just going to keep accelerating guys, right?

1293
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,700
Anywhere there's density, it'll accelerate away from 0 which is just

1294
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,900
not particularly useful useful, right?

1295
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,400
It's not a particularly useful Force.

1296
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,400
So again, so we're still not quite to the point where we don't have to

1297
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:50,800
hack it.

1298
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,700
I mean, we could hack a little bit more of it, which is just to say,

1299
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,700
you know, if the cell density, you know, has to be higher than a

1300
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,600
particular value or something like this too.

1301
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,100
Before that happens or something like this and that would calm things

1302
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,800
down a little bit, but it's still not going to be, you know, it's not

1303
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,300
going to be good enough, right?

1304
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,500
It's not going to be good enough.

1305
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,100
It's still, it's still not going to give us the effect that we want,

1306
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:15,000
but it's starting to get there.

1307
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,800
In fact, you can already kind of see, even just from this.

1308
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,700
You can kind of see how it's how it's already starting to disperse at

1309
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,000
the top more, right?

1310
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,700
Where that density starts to build up.

1311
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,500
But again, there's a bunch of stuff we would need to do in order to

1312
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,900
make this more correct and they are operations on the grid.

1313
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,300
First of all, that would look to see because if first of all, you

1314
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,700
would look at the velocities and the velocities if things were already

1315
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,300
going to move out of the cell, right, you would not feel the need to

1316
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:44,100
disperse them if they were already moving into a place where there

1317
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,000
would be room for them.

1318
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,900
Right?

1319
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,200
And second of lie for density, you would only move things from places

1320
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,800
of higher density to lower density.

1321
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,700
Whereas, right now we're not looking at that at all.

1322
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:59,900
Right, so yeah, so again totally bogus, but you know, what do you do?

1323
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,200
I suppose the thing we could do even just quickly now, I think about

1324
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,000
it that that wouldn't actually be too hard to do is we could do the

1325
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,600
sort of like next door neighbor's.

1326
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,700
Sort of a look look up in the grid which is where we do.

1327
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,600
You know something, where we where we keep these guys a little bit

1328
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,200
more truncated.

1329
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:25,400
So we say something like, you know, you got to be you got to be inside

1330
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,800
the grid by 1 square.

1331
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,900
So there's a, you know, there's always an apron right or whatever.

1332
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,800
And then what we'll do is we'll actually check the neighbors, right?

1333
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,300
So what we do is when we look up the cell, right?

1334
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,900
We've got a couple here cells here.

1335
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:42,400
We've got a cell, you know, that's to the left, right?

1336
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,000
Right.

1337
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,000
Write something like this.

1338
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,300
And we would just basically have all the different all the different

1339
01:04:59,300 --> 01:04:59,700
cells.

1340
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,500
So we'd have y plus 1 which is the up.

1341
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,800
When we have y -1 we have y plus 1 which is right cell and and then we

1342
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,300
have our Center cell, right?

1343
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,700
And then we would literally just go through and instead of any of this

1344
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:14,700
nonsense here, right?

1345
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,500
We would do something like, you know, cell like this version.

1346
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,200
we would initialise it to zero and then we would say something like,

1347
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,200
okay, the cell center density.

1348
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,600
Going from the left cell.

1349
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,900
Going from our cell to the left, so what's the density gradient?

1350
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,500
Right?

1351
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:44,000
And we're going to add to the dispersion, some quantity, you know,

1352
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,800
some proportion of that, right?

1353
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,900
Which is, you know, whatever our whatever, our coefficient of

1354
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,900
dispersion or whatever is here, the debt, whatever the density

1355
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:57,100
difference is, We'll add a force in that direction, right?

1356
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
So if the density in the left,

1357
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Well, I guess I should really do it the other way around.

1358
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,400
If the density coming from the left sell to us, right?

1359
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,600
If we are higher than what we want to do is add a force that pushes us

1360
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,700
towards that cell, right?

1361
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,600
And we would literally just do this for each of those differences.

1362
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,500
Right.

1363
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,400
Or maybe down up would be the correct order there to keep parody.

1364
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,400
But right, does this make some sense?

1365
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,600
I'm literally just checking the neighbors to see.

1366
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:38,500
What the what the density gradient is between the two and then I'm

1367
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:44,200
just adding a force that moves things from a direction of low density

1368
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,900
to one of high density and I don't know what that's going to do again.

1369
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,000
It's like don't really you know this is this is very ad hoc.

1370
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,100
So all I need to do now is just kind of move that coefficient up a bit

1371
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,900
and see, you know, if that if that yields anything beneficial for us

1372
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,500
/, it's just kind of always the time.

1373
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,100
So I'll crank it up a bit.

1374
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,200
And we'll see.

1375
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,800
All right, that's not very much.

1376
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:12,600
Oh, it would help if I ever added the dispersion into anything hahaha.

1377
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:15,300
Awesome.

1378
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,400
Yeah.

1379
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Let's try that again.

1380
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,000
So yeah.

1381
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,400
Our particle acceleration, that's pretty funny.

1382
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,800
So, our acceleration is going to be whatever.

1383
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,600
The constant acceleration is for the thing.

1384
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,100
Plus our dispersion, right man?

1385
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,300
That was stupid.

1386
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,700
All right, you know, sometimes we're stupid.

1387
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,300
Sometimes I'm very stupid.

1388
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,700
I've been known to be extremely stupid.

1389
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:44,800
So there you go.

1390
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,300
Now we've got our dispersion going on and it moves things between

1391
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:49,100
ourselves.

1392
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,500
Based on that density, right?

1393
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,800
And so you can see that that actually works very it's very

1394
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,700
well-behaved now and does sort of sort of what we want but it's still

1395
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,500
not quite the right Fountain shape.

1396
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:04,000
And the reason that it's not quite the right Fountain shape is because

1397
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,300
we don't account for that velocity movement of the fluid, right?

1398
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,000
We don't account for the fact that the velocity was already upward so

1399
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,500
these particles were already going to vacate the cell that they were

1400
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:14,800
in.

1401
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:19,100
We don't have to move them out of the way because

1402
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,899
Is there going to a new location already?

1403
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:23,899
So we need to kind of think a little bit more about that, but you can

1404
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,600
already see it starting to take shape slowly, right?

1405
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,600
And so, we're getting somewhere.

1406
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:30,800
As always, I'm saying we're getting somewhere.

1407
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:36,300
Alright, so I hope you enjoyed that brief introduction to to physical

1408
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,600
simulation or Larry and lagrangian methods.

1409
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,600
It's a bit of a butcher job because we had to do it in one day.

1410
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,399
But what you gonna do it was kind of interesting.

1411
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,200
I had fun with it to be honest.

1412
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,700
It was kind of fun to just suddenly do compositor Larry and lagrangian

1413
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:55,399
simulation of a fountain today but it's overdue for the Q&A, it is

1414
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,399
overdue.

1415
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
So let's go ahead and go ahead and

1416
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Now I threw out a ton of stuff at you.

1417
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,500
So hopefully you've got some questions because I did.

1418
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,399
I covered it very sparsely and so I hope that you will

1419
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:12,100
We'll ask them questions so I can go ahead and clarify that.

1420
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,700
Now we got a good 50 minutes left here.

1421
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:22,700
And a see said, I suppose adding some friction to DPX might help.

1422
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,100
I agree with that, especially on that bounce.

1423
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,700
In fact, if you wanted to add that friction, it'd be pretty easy.

1424
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,100
There's a we're not really simulating the kind of contact area very

1425
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,000
well or anything like that, but on the bounce, we certainly could do

1426
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,399
it.

1427
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,100
You could say that the coefficient of restitution was actually going

1428
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,100
to be on the entire velocity, right?

1429
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,600
And so, instead of doing it this way, we could do something more like

1430
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,100
this, which might, which well, actually, typically you've

1431
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,399
To right.

1432
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:52,100
There's there's there's actually usually two of those, right?

1433
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,100
So, you know, maybe the coefficient of friction is something different

1434
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,700
or something lower, right?

1435
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
But you do it, I guess like this.

1436
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:04,900
Yeah.

1437
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,100
And that would be some friction to just slow that lateral motion down.

1438
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,100
Right.

1439
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,200
Oh, whoops.

1440
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,200
That I didn't mean - there we go.

1441
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,600
So that would be something that kind of dozens that lateral.

1442
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,600
You know, that lateral thing they're on impact, but there's a reasons

1443
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,600
why that's, oh, I should make that much weaker.

1444
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,100
There's reasons why that that's not exactly the best thing.

1445
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,600
But for particle system, it's probably fine, right?

1446
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:34,300
If that makes sense.

1447
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,700
Try reducing the size of the individual cells so you wanted to make

1448
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,900
more cells or something.

1449
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,800
Is that what you mean?

1450
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,400
Like you just want, you just want to see what happens if we have a

1451
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,100
higher resolution data.

1452
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,700
I mean, one of the things that we haven't done like this is very ad

1453
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,300
hoc, right?

1454
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,200
And so one of the problems is we haven't the volume.

1455
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,400
I'll run this and then I'll say what I was going to say.

1456
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:08,400
Right.

1457
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,200
So oh wait, I got change that grits to go down a bit.

1458
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:17,700
Where is my grid scale?

1459
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,100
Where am I grid scale?

1460
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,500
There it is.

1461
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,900
So I'll say, I'll say something about about that in a second here.

1462
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:29,700
Right.

1463
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,400
So there you go.

1464
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,300
That's with a denser grid.

1465
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,900
So let me say one thing about that briefly though.

1466
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,100
So if you were actually doing this like like if we actually sat down

1467
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,800
we're like okay we're going to make a full-on lagrangian or larian

1468
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,500
particle system for high and made hero that's going to be like a real

1469
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,900
thing that we use a lot and we care about it, right?

1470
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:56,700
there's a problem with the way I did this ad hoc the hosta is you

1471
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,800
can't just add a force that's like what's the difference between

1472
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,900
Through cells.

1473
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,600
Okay, there's the difference, add the force.

1474
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:06,700
The reason is because you haven't taken into account the volume of the

1475
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,000
cell because the volume of the cell and the distance, like between

1476
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
cells, right?

1477
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,600
Would change how big that for should be.

1478
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,800
If you don't want to look at the the Delta between two cells this way.

1479
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,100
And then a Delta between two cells that are this size and add the same

1480
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,400
amount of force for the for the density gradient, right?

1481
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,800
Because it would take more force to move.

1482
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,500
Things from this area to this area than it would to move them from

1483
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,500
this area to this area.

1484
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,900
So your you want, you need terms in there that account for the size of

1485
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,100
the cell, right?

1486
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,500
So, so I guess the way I would say is right now, the way we've written

1487
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:48,100
it, it's not would have to be tuned for a particular cell size,

1488
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,100
whereas you could write it in a way, that, although, it wouldn't be

1489
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:55,400
completely oblivious to the cell size because it's the resolution, the

1490
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,800
cells has real effects on the simulation, obviously, it would at least

1491
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,800
not require the constants.

1492
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,400
Retuned, when you changed it.

1493
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,400
Back of the head would make it better protocol than side of the head.

1494
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,300
That's probably true.

1495
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,800
If you want something even freakier, we could do something way

1496
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,300
freakier than this actually though.

1497
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,800
and that would be instead of doing first asset from

1498
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:52,200
we do get random bitmap from and then we would need to pass the sea

1499
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:56,200
and handmade asset.

1500
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,800
Get random groups, random bitmap from.

1501
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,400
Where is it?

1502
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,500
Get random pick, Matt.

1503
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,300
From so be assets type ID series.

1504
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,900
Game state facts.

1505
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,000
To that.

1506
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,800
Why did not oh, oops.

1507
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,700
That was a mistake.

1508
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:39,500
okay, so if I go down here and where we are actually asking to, you

1509
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,700
know, get

1510
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,100
we're we're actually gas going to get the bitmap, but I could do is

1511
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,700
say get random bitmap from

1512
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,300
game state.

1513
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,600
Affects entropy.

1514
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,700
and that way we just have random heads and they'd be flickering all

1515
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,500
In crazy, right?

1516
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,900
So yeah if you want some like crazy shit that's that's that Loop.

1517
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:10,300
Then third swear if you want some crazy stuff, that's what it would

1518
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:10,700
be.

1519
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,800
And and you can also add variety the particles to like if you wanted

1520
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,700
to write, you could do something where that this bitmap ID, so the

1521
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,000
bitmap ID would actually be on the particle.

1522
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:31,900
Frank.

1523
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,500
And if you did it that way, then what you do is when you actually

1524
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,400
spawn the particle.

1525
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,700
The thing would get picked at that time.

1526
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:44,900
So the bitmap ID for the particle will get picked when it actually

1527
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:50,200
when it happened and then the bitmap ID would be something that was

1528
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,300
stored with the particle.

1529
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,700
Again this is all about again making trade-offs of like how complex do

1530
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,700
you want the particle system to be how expensive is it versus how

1531
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,800
versatile are any individual things.

1532
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,500
And so then you got kind of the, the various like, you know,

1533
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,400
Particle.

1534
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,200
All the different heads in there.

1535
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And student in 73.

1536
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I see that you said if you're going to alter the grid scale you

1537
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,500
probably need to scale DC by a to I'm assuming you type that before I

1538
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,100
said the explanation of that.

1539
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:38,500
Yes like I believe you work in these kind of a field in general.

1540
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,800
So you know probably better than I do exactly that thing.

1541
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,600
Which is that yeah like

1542
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,000
If you actually want to do this right?

1543
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,800
You have to work out the forces based on the actual meaning of the

1544
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,600
grid cells.

1545
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,800
And so the dimension of the grid cell is a critical component of the

1546
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,200
scale so that you don't have to like change things like DC, right?

1547
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,700
Did you ever add a way to tell the music to shut off or to just

1548
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,300
disable it?

1549
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,200
I just disabled it.

1550
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,400
What happens if the particles respond between two cells?

1551
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,800
Will that cause and effect?

1552
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,500
Where everything will just not bounce off each other anymore.

1553
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,100
I'm not sure what that means.

1554
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,900
There's really no way to put a particle in between two cells.

1555
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,500
It's going to fall into one cell or the other because yeah.

1556
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,200
So I'm not sure what that means.

1557
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,700
Sorry.

1558
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,000
On API design.

1559
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You recently emphasized right?

1560
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,500
The usage code first and then the implementation later,

1561
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,500
Compression oriented programming is about writing code first and then

1562
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,300
compressing it pulling coated two functions where necessary allowing

1563
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,100
the API to evolve out of that process.

1564
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,500
They seem like two contradictory methods are they how do you decide

1565
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,100
when you're using one or the other?

1566
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:16,200
So, no, I don't actually think of them as contradictory at all

1567
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:16,700
actually.

1568
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,400
Which is weird.

1569
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,200
I know.

1570
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,500
what they actually are is

1571
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,800
if I sit down at the computer,

1572
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,300
And my goal is to reduce the amount of duplication in the code that I

1573
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:40,800
have.

1574
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,800
So, I'm looking at a thing and I'm like, I have to reduce the

1575
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,800
duplication of this thing, right?

1576
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:52,100
Then I already have all the information that I need to do that job,

1577
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,000
compression, or interpreters tells me.

1578
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,800
Here's what I need to do, right?

1579
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,500
So the always write the usage code.

1580
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,300
First thing

1581
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,700
the way that it would be contradictory would be if you said you should

1582
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,400
do that.

1583
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,600
Then meaning I sit down and I have all of the working stuff that I

1584
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,200
need like my code is doing what I wanted to do and then I sat down and

1585
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,500
wrote, you know, the usage code for it first or something like this,

1586
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,000
right?

1587
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:25,800
I said well okay I was going to write a bunch of usage code and then

1588
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,600
try to reverse map that onto the thing.

1589
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,900
That's not usually how I think about it.

1590
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,400
The way that I think about it is if I don't have anything yet meaning,

1591
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,000
I don't know what it is that I'm supposed to be writing.

1592
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,900
I have no idea, right?

1593
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,800
Or I could make up ideas, but I haven't yet, right?

1594
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,600
That's when, when right, the usage code, first is the thing to do so.

1595
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,900
In other words, what we did on the

1596
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,400
I like the, I think it wasn't like I had a bunch of code working.

1597
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,700
That was loading in the Assets, in the streaming way or whatever,

1598
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,600
right already.

1599
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:03,300
And I was just saying, okay, what I need to do is make this reusable,

1600
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,100
we just didn't have an API, we didn't have any, we didn't have or

1601
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,000
sorry, any code that was doing it, right?

1602
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,900
And so when I say it was right to use this code first, I mean it's

1603
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:15,100
okay.

1604
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,900
So now I need to do is I need I need a thing that does this whatever

1605
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,700
it is and I don't have one

1606
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:26,800
So rather than going and starting to formalize, something like go in

1607
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,900
writing an API without having any idea what the thing, you know, who's

1608
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:32,800
going to be calling it?

1609
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,100
I prefer to do the opposite which is to like go at the usage code.

1610
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,100
That is the thing that I wanted to have and then I'll go implement it,

1611
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:40,600
right.

1612
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,400
So I really see them as not actually being contradictory because

1613
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,000
they're actually not doing the same thing.

1614
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:52,800
this not like you could get I don't think of it as being possible to

1615
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,200
get to a point in the program where you could where you could do

1616
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,800
either one, you can only either do one or the other and it's based on

1617
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,100
What you have in front of you, right?

1618
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:07,600
And so if you don't have anything, you write the usage code first.

1619
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
If you do have stuff, then you do the compression reprogramming.

1620
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And another way this there's top-down versus bottom-up.

1621
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Programming is another way to think about that, right?

1622
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,400
Like that.

1623
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,300
Those are phrases that are used a lot in the olders in older school

1624
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,400
literature, right?

1625
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,900
Where it's like you just have to, you have to go the direction.

1626
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,700
From stuff that you have to stuff that you don't have.

1627
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,800
And if the stuff that you have, is that the bottom, you need to go

1628
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,400
upward.

1629
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,800
If the stuff that you have is at the top, you need to go downward.

1630
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:46,400
And so compression oriented programming is saying you have a bunch of

1631
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,000
bottom stuff you're trying to fix.

1632
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,900
That's compression do compression.

1633
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,100
Look at it go.

1634
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:55,500
How do we pull out pieces that do the thing that do the same stuff

1635
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,300
here, right?

1636
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:01,400
If instead what you have is an idea of how things are supposed to

1637
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,900
happen but you don't have anything to make them happen.

1638
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,800
Then you need to go downward and that's like when I say right, this is

1639
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,200
code first, right?

1640
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,800
So, I don't know if that maybe that didn't explain it very well, but

1641
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,800
that's the way I usually tend to think about it.

1642
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,400
It's like there's an empty spot.

1643
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,100
Avoid of information.

1644
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,600
And if that void of information is more specific than the code you

1645
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:27,800
have.

1646
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:31,600
Right now, then you are writing the usage code first if that void of

1647
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,500
information is less specific than the code you have right now, your

1648
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,900
compression compression, or any programming, right?

1649
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,600
We another there's like there was Snuffleupagus.

1650
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:49,600
But then, I don't know what the with the other way it, what the other

1651
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,400
direction would be.

1652
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,400
Would it be possible to split the food competition across two frames?

1653
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,900
Like use the first frame to accumulate velocity momentum changes and

1654
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,000
the second one to resolve them.

1655
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,200
Yes and I think I mentioned that when I said it before, I was like we

1656
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,900
could I'm going to split this in two passes, but we don't have to, we

1657
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:13,200
don't.

1658
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
Yeah, we can we can make that a little bit.

1659
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,800
We can make that not, you know, not do that by using two of the size

1660
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:24,800
of the cells, right?

1661
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,000
One from the last frame, the rest sample from and one from the new

1662
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:32,000
frame, but sometimes that actually is a lose because you because now

1663
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,400
you have more memory and so, your cache performance can be worse,

1664
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:34,600
right?

1665
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,900
So you don't typically want to do that stuff, unless you really know,

1666
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,600
that's a good idea.

1667
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:46,100
Does the size of the grid relative to the to each particle of matter,

1668
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:46,400
much?

1669
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,300
Yes it does.

1670
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,700
And that's what that's one of the problems with these kinds of systems

1671
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,300
to be sure.

1672
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,300
Is you know all computational physics stuff is kind of ad hoc in that

1673
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:55,600
way.

1674
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,400
Where it's like yep.

1675
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,800
It's like we're just making approximations that and so it

1676
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,100
I think that it is sensitive to it.

1677
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:07,100
If the cells are 22, large the simulation won't be accurate enough and

1678
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,700
you won't be able to capture some of the phenomena you need.

1679
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:12,400
If the cells are too small then you will never accumulate enough

1680
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,900
particles into them to actually have them do anything, right.

1681
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,800
Say you're deciding whether to bounce the particles off.

1682
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,500
Based on the density.

1683
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,600
Now then if the particles respond between two cells, wouldn't the

1684
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:36,900
density?

1685
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:39,100
Be halved and not bounce off anymore?

1686
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,900
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1687
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:45,300
You're just saying if the width of the particle stream is wider or as

1688
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:52,300
moved and the answer is, yeah, the again the VIS these schemes are not

1689
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,100
awesome, right?

1690
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,800
There are things you can do to help mitigate that.

1691
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:03,600
For example, you can give particles actual area and add the, you know,

1692
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,900
add to all four.

1693
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,700
So the way that you can solve that or not solve it, but mitigate it is

1694
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,300
to do the bilinear thing again.

1695
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:15,300
So, if a particle is here you add its density to these four centers

1696
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,600
based on its proximity to each of them, right?

1697
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,100
And that gets you out of the business of the in-between to sell

1698
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,100
spawning problem, that you're talking about where you got some

1699
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,000
particles in here and some particles in here and now you're trying to

1700
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,200
talk about the density there, right?

1701
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,900
So, there are some things you can do to help mitigate that.

1702
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,100
But again, discretize all methods that involve discretizing things to

1703
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,800
a grid, have a lot of problems like that.

1704
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,500
And so you just have to be, you just have to be okay with knowing that

1705
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,400
the goal here is to / to produce some kind of effect.

1706
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:53,300
And if you can produce it with a district ization, it's okay.

1707
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,900
But is it going to be perfect?

1708
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,100
No.

1709
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,600
It's going to be very far from perfect.

1710
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,400
Let's see with simulated annealing work for this issue.

1711
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:32,500
What?

1712
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,400
What issue?

1713
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,600
I'm not sure what the issue was.

1714
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,900
Doesn't writing, usage code.

1715
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:42,000
First imply, Simplicity in API calls, well, yet, try.

1716
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,900
I mean, it it that's one of the metrics that you would be trying for.

1717
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:51,300
Doesn't this box you in when trying to create persistent things on the

1718
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,100
stack?

1719
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,900
I don't see why those are even related.

1720
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,600
All complex initializations for persistent.

1721
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,700
Have to be done somewhere.

1722
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,800
That is true.

1723
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,600
If done on the stack how do you persist complex data structs without

1724
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,600
using static?

1725
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:16,900
Well, if you're persisting it, you wouldn't put it on this stack.

1726
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,700
If by the stack, you mean the program stack, you would put it on.

1727
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,200
It's appropriate lifetime stack, right?

1728
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
Like, we've been doing and handmade hero.

1729
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,000
so, I'm not sure, I understand those questions, really

1730
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:47,200
Bring Cruise.

1731
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,900
Our current simulation is in pixel space.

1732
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,200
No, it's in meters.

1733
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,400
Our pre-rendered effects viable.

1734
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,000
Wow.

1735
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,200
In handmade hero there, probably aren't something I would want to do

1736
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:11,600
because it's is about programming.

1737
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,800
And so we want to do things that are programmer e.

1738
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,100
And so, I would say, most of the time, what we want to do is do our

1739
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:18,500
effects dynamically, right?

1740
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,600
Because this is more learning that way, like, we learned a bunch of

1741
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,900
stuff today, even just hacking around with this and like, you know,

1742
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,700
are you ready to go an off and write your own physical simulation

1743
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,000
code?

1744
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,900
No, because we only just kind of brushed against it in a very, very

1745
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,800
quick and dirty way.

1746
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,300
but,

1747
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,400
you know, you can see that that doing effects like this.

1748
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,500
When we say, let's let's make, let's figure out how to program them

1749
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,800
rather than having an artist make them or something, and then just

1750
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,800
didn't display them back.

1751
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,500
You learn a lot of programming that way.

1752
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,000
So I think that's pretty important, and that's kind of where what I

1753
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,200
would like to stick to on the stream as much as possible, Right?

1754
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:04,100
So there's our lovely fountain.

1755
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,100
It's kind of cool.

1756
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:07,700
Actually.

1757
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,200
I feel like I'm liking it.

1758
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,500
I feel like our d alpha is maybe a little high though.

1759
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,800
I feel like our d alpha maybe wants to be smaller.

1760
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,300
So we can kind of see it.

1761
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,200
It's just kind of fun to see it pile up a little more, right.

1762
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,500
Do you see how it's doing some pretty cool stuff there?

1763
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,800
Like the water isn't getting near the nozzle because the nozzle is

1764
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,300
very high density down here, right?

1765
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,100
It's just kind of fun, like, even already.

1766
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,400
Like that's what's cool about about, leveling up your physics

1767
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,100
simulations a little bit, not that.

1768
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:51,700
We've really done much of a physical sensation are.

1769
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:54,400
We've done the simplest dumbest possible thing right.

1770
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:58,900
But that's already so much cooler than the hack we were doing.

1771
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,300
Because now it's actually starting to capture some of the phenomenon

1772
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:06,400
that you might want, which is the water staying away from other water,

1773
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:06,700
right?

1774
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,900
And dispersing itself out in that way.

1775
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,900
And so, you know, it's just, it's cool.

1776
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,400
All right, so we're over time for about 8 minutes overtime, so I'm

1777
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,300
going to call it.

1778
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,500
I'm going to call it a day.

1779
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,800
That is that's kind of cool.

1780
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,700
That is just fun.

1781
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,400
I mean, you know, you got to admit that a spewing head fountain, that

1782
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,900
that sprays heads into the air is, is pretty cool.

1783
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
At some level, I wonder what would happen?

1784
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,100
This is always what you get.

1785
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,300
If I decrease the spawn rate a little bit too.

1786
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,400
I'm interested to know what would happen.

1787
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,100
There looks roughly the same but you kind of get a little more.

1788
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,700
It's like less force on the nozzle.

1789
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,800
So it gets a little more.

1790
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,100
It's kind of throws up.

1791
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:02,800
It throws them up a little bit more as they kind of get into spurts.

1792
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,700
That will ya got its physics?

1793
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,200
Stuff is just cool, it's just cool.

1794
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,900
And so there are you know if I spray it out more at a time again,

1795
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:14,100
haven't given them any more upward velocity.

1796
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:19,700
I've just I've just increased basically the hose the, the pressure on

1797
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:20,400
the hose.

1798
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,200
This is fun, right?

1799
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,500
I mean that's just fun is nothing.

1800
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,800
There's nothing better than the crazy physics stuff like that, it's

1801
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,600
just amusing, right?

1802
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,700
That's great.

1803
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,300
So I think, you know, what else?

1804
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:38,900
It would be nice to do at some point, too.

1805
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,900
I mean, it's, we're we're not only supposed to be working on particle

1806
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:42,500
systems right now.

1807
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,300
So maybe we'll revisit this in a while, but we'll also want to do a

1808
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,100
thing so that, you know, they could kind of be more stationary.

1809
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,100
It's kind of fun.

1810
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,700
I wonder if we should just do like on next week as particle systems

1811
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:54,200
week.

1812
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:58,200
Probably not probably not do those later.

1813
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,000
All right.

1814
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,300
Okay.

1815
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,700
I'm going to close everything down.

1816
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,800
Particle systems who doesn't love particle systems.

1817
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,800
Alright, so here we go.

1818
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,000
Thank you everyone for joining me, for another episode of handmade

1819
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,500
hero.

1820
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:18,900
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1821
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,100
As always, I hope you enjoyed our brief foray into particle systems

1822
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:25,600
and the discount, in your interest peaked in such things which we will

1823
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,700
maybe talk a little bit more on later on in the project when we want

1824
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:32,900
to focus on effects for a bit, but until then if you would like to

1825
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:35,000
play around with the product source code or any of the other source

1826
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,900
code, if you preorder the game on handmade here at or get does come

1827
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,400
with the source code so you can check that out and download it every

1828
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,600
night after I'm done, I upload new zip file so you can always have the

1829
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:44,200
latest

1830
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,300
Also, we have a forum site, if you'd like to come ask questions, or if

1831
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,800
you want to download ports to Mac and Linux that community members

1832
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,600
have done, they post them.

1833
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,600
There there's also an antidepressant guide maintained by the

1834
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:54,900
community.

1835
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:55,600
That's pretty cool.

1836
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,400
We have a patreon page, you can subscribe to if you want support the

1837
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,800
video series and we have a tweet.

1838
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,500
Art, which treats the schedule at you.

1839
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,400
So if you want to catch the series live you can do that.

1840
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,100
And speaking of catching it live, we will probably be back here

1841
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,100
Monday, 5 p.m.

1842
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:13,100
Pacific Daylight time next week, but just to be sure do check that

1843
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:13,600
tweet Bacchus.

1844
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,500
Sometimes we have to do other schedule things depending on my schedule

1845
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,100
for the week, just to make sure we can all fit in.

1846
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,800
So that's about it.

1847
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,800
I hope you will have a particle filled weekend and have fun coding.

1848
