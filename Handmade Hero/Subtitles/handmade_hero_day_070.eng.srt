1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,300
Are you okay?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,300
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to handmade hero the show where we could a complete game from

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,300
scratch live on Twitch.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,600
We of course do not use any engines or libraries, we write everything

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,100
from scratch so that we can have one full path through an entire game.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,200
So we've seen at literally all the code from the thing that puts the

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,000
pixels on the screen, all the way up to high level stuff like AI.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,900
We've tried to basically say we're going to cover every last bit of

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,200
it.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,600
So right now what we're doing is we're kind of wrapping up some stuff

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,300
that we did.

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,000
We're at a point where we need to kind of decide what sort of things

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,100
were going to push into.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,000
So, you know, we're probably going to do on today is do some sort of

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,900
remaining issues and then maybe try to think about what the next big

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,300
step is that we want to make because we've been trying to do is

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,400
basically build out, essentially a prototype, functional version of a

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
game engine that has all the

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,300
Pieces in it so that we can see how they all fit together so that we

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,200
can start to make sort of final implementations of individual pieces

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,000
as necessary.

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,100
And this is a very flexible process.

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,500
Obviously we've done some parts.

25
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,800
That may be totally what we end up shipping.

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,200
Like we've done some parts that maybe are just fine.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,100
We've got other parts where we sort of said okay yeah this this is

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:27,900
kind of a bad version or a half-baked algorithm but we know that it

29
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,100
does the things that we needed to do so later we

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,700
Come back and do a good industrial strength pieces of code here and be

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,200
done with it, right?

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,100
And so our goal in this passed through things because we need

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,400
something start with is to get a sort of a version of everything in

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,700
the game that we want happening, everything that we think the engine

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,700
needs to do so that we can start writing the game.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,500
And if we need to add things later, that's always fine too.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,800
And if we need to build out pieces of the engine, that need to the end

38
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
up needing to be better or more complicated, than what we thought.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,100
That's all

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,600
Fine.

41
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,400
And that's all totally par for the course.

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,300
But what I wanted to do first was make sure of course the released

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,500
have one pass through because it's very important to be able to see

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,900
how things work by experimentation and exploration.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Before you try to go spend a lot of time building, robust code for any

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,300
individual purpose, for example, with the renderer, we want to get to

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,700
a point where we know how we want to use the renderer with before we

48
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,100
would actually write industrial-strength renderer because otherwise,

49
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,700
Guys, we would run the risk of writing a renderer that doesn't do the

50
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,900
things that we need to do or doesn't do them quickly.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,100
So if we know what those things are right ahead of time, we know how

52
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,600
the interface looks, we know how everything should flow through there.

53
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,800
That just puts in a much better position to succeed.

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
And the same is true for everything else.

55
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,100
The Collision detectors, the same way we've kind of been working on

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,700
what the, what needs to happen there and how that needs to work path,

57
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,900
finding things like that, that we're going to probably talk on the

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,400
future.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Those are the same kinds of things.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,800
We need to know what our needs are.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,800
And how our code wants to use things like pathfinding before we would

62
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,400
want to go and write some really nice system that does fancy stuff,

63
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,000
right?

64
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,600
So that's what we're doing today is we're sort of continuing down that

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,400
road and so we don't have any specific bullet point item, but we've

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,500
got some things that we can take a look at.

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,300
So that's that's kind of what we were going to do.

68
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,200
All right, so let's take a look.

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,700
If you are coding along at home today is Day 70, which means you will

70
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,400
want to.

71
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,400
If you pre-ordered the game, you should have got Link in your email.

72
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,900
And that link should allow you to download the zip file which has Zips

73
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,500
inside it.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,900
It's like are you know, matroska dollar whatever they call them little

75
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,400
nesting dolls, you can open up that zip file and there will be a zip

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,900
for day, 69, which was yesterday if you unzip that into a directory,

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,800
you'll be starting off with exact same code that I'm starting off with

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,200
now.

79
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,300
And so if you want to follow,

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,200
Long at home.

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,900
That's that's the way to do it.

82
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,800
All right, so I wanted to say something at the outset today, I don't

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:06,900
know.

84
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,600
Maybe this will be the something that we do today because it just it,

85
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,700
it's not really something that necessarily I would be concerned about

86
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,100
right now, but I thought of it and I thought that it might be a neat

87
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,900
thing to just kind of show for, you know, sir because it's a

88
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,800
programming thing.

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,500
Let's put it that way.

90
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,300
So basically, you know, we were talking yesterday

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,700
and we implemented some stuff about base Collision rules list, right?

92
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,600
It was a list where I could add rules to it.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,500
And it would allow people to either Collide or not Collide based on

94
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,600
the rules, right?

95
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,500
And so, one of the things we did was like, you know, when, when

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,700
something hits something else, you can tell it to keep going.

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,600
And the reason we did that was, we wanted to have projectiles, like

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,900
that that little test projectile that I added the other day to be able

99
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,300
to go through that guy.

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,000
But still have the event recorded.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So we wanted him to be able to recognize the fact that it hit our

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
little torso monstar.

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,700
There we want people to respond to that as a collision event, but we

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,700
didn't actually want the Collision system to do anything about it.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,900
The, we want to let it, you know, let them direct I'll sail through.

106
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,100
So we added that but then we also want it to no.

107
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
Don't keep giving us notifications about the fact that these two guys

108
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,500
are touching because we don't care.

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,900
We only want to know when it.

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
And so we wanted a system for adding rules.

111
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,600
So what we did is we made a little hash table that you could add

112
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,000
things into, and we said, all right, when two objects touch each

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,500
other.

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,700
If the response to that Collision says, I don't want to hear about

115
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,200
this anymore.

116
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,500
It just can add a rule to that table and then it will never get that

117
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,200
response anymore.

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Now, we don't know if that's actually a good way to handle this.

119
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,900
It was just sort of something that I thought I was.

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,200
Like let's try it that way and so we made that little hash table but

121
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,100
we did have a

122
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,900
A thing that I mentioned which was I was like, I'm not sure how we

123
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,800
pull things out of this hash table.

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,700
Right.

125
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm not sure how we clear this hash table effectively because there

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,900
was a very specific point which was basically a go ahead and jump to

127
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,500
it, which was that, for example, with things like the sword are sword,

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,600
going to quote that you throw their when it, you know, when it starts

129
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,900
traveling, we want to say, okay, it's got a collision rule.

130
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,900
It can't collide with the hero at all and when it hits them, the

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
monstar, we want it to just go ahead and

132
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,700
Do that once.

133
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,700
So on collision, will add a rule for that.

134
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Obviously that's not going to work.

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,600
If we do that every time, this sort of storm because we keep adding

136
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,700
more and more rules and every time it went through a different monster

137
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,100
that be a new rule and we just proliferate the number of rules.

138
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,000
We just have thousands of rules as the player played the game so there

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,200
need to be a time when the rules are removed.

140
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,800
So we have this clear Collision rules thing but the problem was in

141
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
order to clear the Collision rules for a particular

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,400
For a particular entity, there was no good way to find where those

143
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
rules exist in the hash table.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Because the hash table was essentially a duel in the lookup, hash

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,600
table, where you pass, two indices, The Entity one, The Entity, you

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,900
know, in any Collision, there's two entities, entity a entity be.

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,300
And the way we made the hash table work is we just look it up on

148
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,900
entity a, right?

149
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
So, if the entity that you're happy,

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,500
To be clearing, always showed up as entity, a, well that would work

151
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,000
fine.

152
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,100
But if sometimes, it shows up at nndb, there'd be no way to use the

153
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,500
hash table to quickly, find those entries and remove them and that's a

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,700
problem, right?

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,500
so,

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I said, well,

157
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,600
We need an effective to do here, need to make it better data structure

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
that allows removal of collision rules without searching the entire

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,500
table.

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,600
I was thinking about it afterwards, when I was walking to work, and I

161
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,300
realized there actually was a really obvious solution.

162
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,800
We could have used here, we could have made a trade you and still used

163
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,500
exactly the same hash table but had Direct removal of entries, right?

164
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,800
Sorry, I'm so sick today.

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,500
Hmm.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
It's also allergy season here.

167
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,299
Spring has come very early to Seattle.

168
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,100
It's been an extremely Sunny normally.

169
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,400
We have a rainy season and we didn't really, it's been really sunny

170
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
and nice in Seattle, which is good in some sense.

171
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,800
But it also means I think that the trees are pollinating me which

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,000
never goes well anyway.

173
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,900
So what I was thinking is we did we could have made a trade-off that

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That work and I wanted to talk about it and maybe we could maybe we'll

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,900
implement it, I don't know.

176
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,000
But basically, here we go, let's say here, we are on Day 70.

177
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,100
So we've got a hash table, right?

178
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,500
Hash, Hash Hash Hash Hash.

179
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,100
And the problem is, however, we compute the hash key, right?

180
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
So we've got incoming, we've got an index a and an index, be right.

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,700
And however, we insert this into this table, we're going to have a

182
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,300
problem.

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,500
If we want to be able to clear all of the entries, that involve some

184
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,700
entity e because we don't know how to compute.

185
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,400
The hash key just for me and it doesn't matter what rule we pick,

186
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,100
right?

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,800
If we only inserted them using a, then if he happens to show up in the

188
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,900
b key, we can't find it right without searching, but if we base the

189
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,500
insertion off, be the same would be true of a, if we base it off the

190
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,900
combination of A and B, then we can't find it at all.

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,400
It doesn't matter if it's a or b, we can't find it.

192
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Because when we look up on E, we don't know how to produce a combined

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,400
hash key from that, right?

194
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
So the question is given a hash table that supposed to store things

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
that you look up on a and b?

196
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,500
How do you make it so that we can just look up on one of them?

197
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,200
And without it being too onerous, allow removal, right?

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,700
How do we do it?

199
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,500
So there's actually a couple different ways that we can do it, and I

200
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,700
mentioned, one of them and I want to mention the other one which is

201
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,600
kind of amusing.

202
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,300
The reason it's kind of amusing is because it would work without a

203
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
hand coded structure, right?

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,600
So basically, if you think about it, we've got this hash table, right?

205
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
And in the hash table, we've got an external chain, right?

206
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,200
And so we've got basically, this is just a pointer.

207
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,600
These are Pointers in here, they're not

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Entries and these are the actual entries.

209
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,500
So these store like a bee, you know, another, A and B, whatever.

210
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,400
I guess we should call this c and d, right?

211
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,800
And so, you know, somewhere else down here.

212
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,600
I may have something which was a rule that was, that was like, C and

213
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,900
A.

214
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
And so, that's the problem there.

215
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
The problem is, is that the a shows up secondarily.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,600
So if I was going to look, even if I do it off of a, I'm going to find

217
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,900
this one.

218
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm not going to find that one, but I should have removed them.

219
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,300
Both right?

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,800
So another option that we could do is we could add two more pointers

221
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,300
right to these which are basically ways of chaining off of the

222
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,400
elements, right?

223
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,300
We could put another chain through here which is that every one of

224
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,400
these guys also has two pointers on them.

225
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,100
Right?

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,800
And those pointers point two for each of the slots like a linked list

227
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
through the hash table.

228
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:00,800
Right.

229
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,800
So basically on the see, you know, we come through here, it would

230
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
point to this guy on the a it would point to this guy or whatever,

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,900
right?

232
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,000
So that you could go through them and remove them.

233
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,200
So we'd store with each entity a pointer into the hash table, so that

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
to the first thing that have them, or we would just look up in the

235
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
hash table, some way.

236
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,700
I don't know, right?

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,100
But you see that, this gets pretty messy because we have to add two

238
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
pointers to everything.

239
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,500
And when we get there, how do we remove it?

240
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,900
Because

241
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's say we end up with this guy.

242
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,600
If we point to this guy, we don't actually know which hatch slot he

243
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,100
was in.

244
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,200
So removing it, we don't know how to fix up this pointer because we

245
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,300
can't get back.

246
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,300
Right?

247
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,600
So it's kind of ugly and confusing and it's like, what do you do,

248
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,400
right?

249
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,000
So there's another option and I just want to point it out because it's

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,200
kind of interesting how it works.

251
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,500
And one of the things I want to show on the stream again, and that's

252
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,800
why I've been writing all the data structures by hand, for example,

253
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,400
as I want to show how to write data structures because oftentimes if

254
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,100
you are fast that if you don't, you know, if your answer to how you

255
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,800
store stuff is not always, just open up the standard template library

256
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
and grab something.

257
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,900
If you actually code them by hand, a lot of options, open up to you.

258
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
If you have that kind of practice and that facility with the

259
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,400
instructors, it means you can make purpose-built stuff in cases where

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
you need it, right?

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,200
And so in this case, if we have another way of thinking about it,

262
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,300
but,

263
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,800
When you actually think about it, too.

264
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
You'll also, this is not a good.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,100
This is not a good demonstration of reasons to code things by hand,

266
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,800
because this is the actual method that I thought of as something that

267
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,500
would work.

268
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,700
Even if you were using a off-the-shelf component to store them, I'm

269
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,500
pretty sure anyway,

270
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,700
I don't actually know.

271
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,100
But I assume you could combine.

272
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Yeah.

273
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,600
You could, you could combine like an STL map and an STL list to do

274
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,800
this.

275
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,300
Let's say.

276
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,200
So what I realized was well

277
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You know, we're if we're going to spend some extra storage like two

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,100
extra pointers, right?

279
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,700
And and we do to exercise and then still get a system where we don't

280
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
even know how it would work.

281
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,200
Right to extra pointers on a 64-bit system is like 16 bytes, right?

282
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Because each one is 8.

283
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Bytes each point is 8, bytes.

284
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,900
So that's pretty expensive, right?

285
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
Concerning the fact that these were two un.

286
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,900
So actually, there was only eight bytes here and then the Boule, you

287
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,100
know, was another four bytes or whatever.

288
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,700
But we could have made that smaller if we wanted.

289
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,200
To.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,400
We could even probably snuggle it in some way by using the high

291
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,800
bidder, some weird stuff like this.

292
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,500
So, these were actually pretty small these things, then there was an

293
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,900
eight by pointer to the next field was actually, you know, pretty big.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
So adding this though

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,300
Wouldn't.

296
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,600
We're not quite double the size but it would make a size quite

297
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,600
considerably more.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,200
So the question is, if we were going to to go that big, if we were

299
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,500
going to look at two x sized things, which is what you have to do, if

300
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,200
you were going to start to do some of that, chaining version is there

301
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,600
something else you could do?

302
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,400
That would be much easier and work more in a more straightforward

303
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,700
fashion and the answer is yes, I think there is so when we insert a

304
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
and b and we know that we want to be able to search for e,

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,900
In our hash table.

306
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
What we could do?

307
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,500
Is we could say, whenever we do an insertion, instead of inserting

308
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,800
just on a key, like, what we're doing now that we're doing just based

309
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,500
on a or on something else like that, insert it based on a so insert it

310
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,100
this in a position based on a.

311
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,700
So this would be the A's hash lat, right?

312
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,200
So here is the a b that we insert, right?

313
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,700
So that goes in there, then insert it on be as well.

314
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,600
So if this is where B goes be Collision rules, go right?

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Also inserted here, right?

316
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,100
And we insert it the other way round if we want to as well, right?

317
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,500
So we just insert, we insert the two versions.

318
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,800
We insert a b and we insert be a right now.

319
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,900
If we want to remove something entity e, we can look up on end of the

320
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,300
E.

321
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,800
And we know that no matter whether it was in this position or this

322
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,600
position, we know that we will find, let's say we come in,

323
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,800
We get B, which before would have failed.

324
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,700
We know that we will find one of the two in the pair.

325
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,700
When we look

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,800
When we find that one, we now have the information necessary to remove

327
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,200
the other one because this gives us the a that we didn't have.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,500
So we can then do the removal by calling the exact same routine on the

329
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
pair flip the other way round.

330
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,400
Right?

331
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
So the algorithm for doing this removal then becomes pretty

332
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,300
straightforward.

333
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,200
We do one pass on the removal of a b that will

334
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,200
Remember, all the things we remove go on to the free list, right?

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Here's the free list that will put the things on the free list, right?

336
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,400
So be a goes, it gets inserted onto the free list, and here's where

337
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,300
the free list was before and and be a goes on here, right?

338
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,600
All we have to do now is basically grab a pointer to that free list.

339
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,000
Remember before we start before we do that pass, remember the top of

340
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,600
the free list beforehand.

341
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,700
Whatever it was.

342
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,200
So this is the previous top of the

343
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,900
Free list.

344
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,800
We just Loop through from there to until we get to the top of the free

345
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,300
list.

346
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,100
We Loop through and call remove on the reverse of each of these

347
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,600
things.

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
Problem solved.

349
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,600
Now we have direct removal from our hash table, right?

350
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,400
It works.

351
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,400
In all the, in all the cases, there's nothing weird there and we don't

352
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,400
actually have to write a different routine, right?

353
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
It's totally fine.

354
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,300
So that's kind of interesting and it's a neat way to do this.

355
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,000
So I mean that might be the best way to do it after, I mean, I don't

356
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,800
know, right?

357
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
And again there's a there's a cost to it.

358
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,800
It doubles the entry count to our hash table, right?

359
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:33,200
So if this thing was really big, then then that would probably be a

360
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
bad solution, right?

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,900
Like if this if

362
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,400
Concerned about the storage cost, for this hash table.

363
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
That wouldn't be good.

364
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
We don't really know if we're concerned about that yet.

365
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,600
So it's a little premature to even say one way or the other I suspect

366
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,200
we probably will never be concerned about it because compared to our

367
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,900
add a start asset size, I suspect this probably will be pretty tiny.

368
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,900
But we now know that for a to excise cost, we could totally make that

369
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,000
happen, right?

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,900
And then we wouldn't have to bother

371
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,400
sorting the indices when we look them up either, we just look up,

372
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,700
whatever.

373
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,300
However, they came in because we know we'd always find the rule, no

374
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,000
matter which order.

375
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,500
We look things up because they're both in there, right?

376
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,400
So I thought I'd point that out because it was just kind of neat, and

377
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,700
I'll put a note in here as in case.

378
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
So if we do decide that we want do that eventually we can

379
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Say one way to make removal easy, would be to always add both orders

380
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,700
of the pairs of storage indices to the hash table.

381
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,900
So, no matter which position The Entity is in.

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,300
You can always find it then when you do your first pass through for

383
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,100
removal, you just remember the original top.

384
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Of the free list.

385
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,700
And when you're done, do a pass through that list.

386
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Pass through all the new things on the free list and remove the

387
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
reverse of those.

388
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,200
Pears.

389
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,700
So you go, so I was kind of happy with that and I was like, I should

390
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,800
probably talk about that in stream because it's kind of fun.

391
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
All right, so,

392
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's take a look here.

393
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,500
Somebody reported a bug.

394
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
That was I'm very glad they caught because this would be one that, you

395
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,400
know, I don't even know.

396
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,300
It might never have B us, but if it had been us, we would have been

397
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
very grumpy because it would have taken a long time to find because we

398
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,300
just wouldn't have thought to look here for a while.

399
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:54,800
Probably.

400
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,900
So in our ad radius to remember which

401
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,600
I basically wrote to enlarge or rectangle, we these are wrong, right?

402
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,000
It's supposed to be that we add the width and the height, and subtract

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
the width and the height respectively, but I had type.

404
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,400
I totally typed them in wrong total typos.

405
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,300
And so that would never have cause us any problems with the way we're

406
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,000
using it now, because we were passing the same value for a wh.

407
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,800
But if we ended up in the case eventually, where we were weren't

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,500
Ain't doing that right where we were passing different values for wh

409
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,500
it would have stopped working properly.

410
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,700
And we would have been like, what is happening, right?

411
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,700
So, thankfully, someone who had been working along with the videos,

412
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,000
notice.

413
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,400
They were like, wait, is that right?

414
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
And I'm like nope, that is not right?

415
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,600
So again thank you to everyone who actually does go and work through

416
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,000
the code.

417
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's really awesome to have that help again.

418
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,400
Like it's hard those are mistakes that you know I that's a mistake I

419
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,900
would make

420
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Just day-to-day programming, even right?

421
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Sometimes you make typos, but I definitely even make them at a higher

422
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,700
rate on the stream to because my concentration is split between the

423
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,000
explanation in the code.

424
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,800
And so it really is helpful.

425
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,300
When people point out stuff like that because it's not that

426
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,100
interesting usually to show how you find a bug like that, right?

427
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,600
It's like oh it was just a typo and we were right.

428
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
And so, you know, it does save us time on the stream if people can

429
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,700
point out like, oh hey, you know, you made a typo here.

430
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,800
It's like, that's probably better than watching me to bug it.

431
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,900
It most of the time because, you know, like I said, I try to show

432
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,600
debugging on the stream for any hard problems.

433
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Obviously it's good.

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,300
And so, I always do all the debugging myself, which is how I think it

435
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,100
should go, but it is helpful to have people, write in and catch those

436
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,400
things.

437
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,200
I think because, you know, we don't need to hunt down every typo on

438
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,700
the street.

439
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,600
Alright, that's it for my to do notes.

440
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,500
I got so you had a little post it to remind myself of those two

441
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,900
things.

442
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,100
So that's it for that.

443
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,100
So now we got to talk about a couple things.

444
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,200
First of all, we got talking about where we're at now.

445
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,900
We've got a couple things to do.

446
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,700
So, you know, one of the obvious things that we need to fix, is

447
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
sorting, we're not sorting.

448
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,400
So, we draw just in whatever any order which allows this do.

449
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,100
You know, this guy goes behind those trees, which is nonsensical.

450
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,400
I've been kind of putting that off just because I think that's just

451
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
best to go in the render and it's not really causing us any

452
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,800
consolation.

453
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,400
It's annoying me and probably people on the stream but it's

454
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,900
Not really impeding our ability to code forward.

455
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,000
So I'm not going to do that till we get to the render because the

456
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,700
render is going to have to do that and we might as well just put that

457
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,300
in the right place instead of packing it in now for no apparent

458
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,500
reason, right?

459
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
So when we're actually going through working on the renderer we'll

460
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,200
just do that and that won't be too long anyway so there's that so I'm

461
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,500
going to continue to put that off.

462
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,500
The other thing that we need to do is give our monstar some behavior

463
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,800
and also figure out what we want to do when like a month star dies.

464
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
For example, those sorts of things.

465
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,800
So that's on the table.

466
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:12,200
We also have to start thinking about a couple things like so world how

467
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,600
we're going to sew

468
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,500
I added that Collision real stuff and I said this would might be

469
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,800
interesting because you can add those rules.

470
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,600
We're going to need something a little fancier to, you know, in the

471
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,900
Collision detection department.

472
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,500
And I'm wondering, if maybe we should do, even though, you know, the

473
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,600
time might not be right to do the full closures, ha, I'm wondering if

474
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,400
we need to just even go a little further on that.

475
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Because here's another thing that I was thinking about.

476
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,300
So, with our Collision rules, it was an interesting thing and I kind

477
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,700
of like the fact we implemented it we may use it, it may be a good

478
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,100
thing but I

479
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,700
Wonder if we're going to maybe have to lean more heavily on some kind

480
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,700
of a system that does have a little bit more of a geometric

481
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,300
interpretation.

482
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,200
Because one of things I was thinking about is let's say we want to

483
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200
make a pressure plate to step on, right.

484
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
One way to do that, would be to make the pressure plate.

485
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,100
Entity we step on it, right?

486
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
And you know, it opens a door.

487
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,200
Look at removes some enemies or something, right?

488
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,900
So I can get walk through a door.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
In fact, maybe that's what we should make.

490
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,200
The problem with that pressure plate is that I need to add a collision

491
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,500
rule so that I don't keep getting called back about the fact that I

492
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,900
stepped on the pressure plate.

493
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,200
Potentially like maybe I only want to get notified once that I stepped

494
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,600
on it.

495
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,400
Well.

496
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Obviously we can use a collision rule for that.

497
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
It would work fine.

498
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,600
But when do you remove the Collision rule Collision rules are really

499
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,700
only effective if there's a defined time like with this sword thing

500
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,900
that I was talking about a defined time window where they operate in

501
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,400
so that they can get removed because if they never got removed like

502
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
with a pressure plate, I step on it.

503
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,300
How do I know when to remove that Collision rule, right?

504
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,500
And I guess you could say as well when you step off the pressure

505
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,500
plate, we could remove the Collision rule but I don't know how to know

506
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,700
when we would step off the cushion.

507
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,400
The the pressure plate if our whole definition of doing Collision,

508
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,700
testing is based on these rules.

509
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,700
Now, maybe what we could say is well, okay, we have two ways of

510
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,200
testing things.

511
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,100
The question sector, which is something we would have any way, which

512
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,200
is are two things overlapping currently.

513
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,800
And then there's the weather things go into or out of stuff.

514
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:39,200
But if we go that route and that has to work properly, then we might

515
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,000
as well maybe just use that for most of the things we have entry and

516
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,900
exit you know ideas of collision.

517
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,600
Do we even need the rules anymore?

518
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
At that point?

519
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,100
Or can we just use those and the answer is?

520
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Well, I don't know, maybe we still want the rules for extra

521
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,900
robustness, because in the case of

522
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,500
S of where things are kind of numerically.

523
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
Fiddly, maybe we don't want

524
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Accidentally record multiple hits.

525
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't know, but those are just the kind of things I was thinking

526
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,000
about.

527
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
And so I don't know if maybe we want to go back through the Collision

528
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,900
detection, one more time, clean those things up.

529
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,400
And maybe say, all right, let's get a real notion of entry and exit in

530
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,100
here, which you probably want to have anyway and maybe start using

531
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
that for some of the things.

532
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,600
I don't know.

533
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,500
So those have been the kind of things that are on my mind right now

534
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,900
and I'm not sure which ones we should do, I guess maybe.

535
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,900
Maybe just for a little bit of a change of pace.

536
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,900
Maybe let's go do pathfinding or something and then, we'll, we'll come

537
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,700
back and maybe we'll do some Collision detection after that.

538
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,200
I don't know.

539
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,100
I think about that.

540
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,400
It's just something to think about.

541
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,700
So, for example, like one thing that we could do is, we could go ahead

542
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,100
and Implement having the familiar be able to get through a more

543
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,800
complicated, sort of, you know, having the familiar be able to get to

544
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,800
us even through.

545
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,500
More complicated sort of arrangement of trees, right?

546
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
So we can make a more complicated Arrangement or week.

547
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,700
I could just do this sort of thing and then we could see that it could

548
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,200
find its way around, right.

549
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,600
So that's a pretty difficult problem in might take us a while so that

550
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,000
might be a good thing for us to do to write.

551
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,100
So I'm just thinking aloud here because we're getting to the point

552
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,500
where we need to sort of pick a new major thing to do.

553
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,600
All right?

554
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,700
So

555
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,800
beyond all of that obviously is also animation.

556
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,500
That's the last thing that we definitely need to do and that would be

557
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,900
like getting this guy to hop.

558
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,600
I've kind of been everywhere all the time.

559
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,700
I've been like, oh, we should go do animation next year, summation X

560
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,600
but I never actually quite get to it.

561
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,000
We keep deciding that there's something else we might want to do ahead

562
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,500
of time.

563
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,800
And so I don't know.

564
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,200
That's the other thing that we could go get that we could go tackle

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,200
and that's going to be, you know, kind of a whole

566
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,300
Separate branches.

567
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Well I should probably be listing these things out, right.

568
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,200
So let's go ahead and take a little piece of handmade dot h here.

569
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,500
And I'm going to go ahead and say put it to do up here.

570
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,800
So let's see.

571
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,800
We want to do animation, right?

572
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,200
So we want to do our animation.

573
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,900
I guess what I would say is animation should should probably lead into

574
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,300
rendering because animation will motivate our renderer quite a bit.

575
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,700
You know that would include particle systems probably as well systems

576
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,300
and skeletal animation basically what we want here.

577
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,000
So this is kind of our graphical effects sort of a stuff that we got

578
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,500
to do.

579
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,800
So, we'd want to put in some of that, and then that will lead directly

580
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,600
into rendering.

581
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,700
So we know that these two come in this order because we'd want to have

582
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,000
animation going first so that we have a bunch of motivation to get our

583
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
rendering doing the things that we need to do.

584
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,600
So, for example, when we add

585
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,500
Animation in there, were we're going to want to rotate pieces of the

586
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,700
guy and we're not gonna be able to do that right?

587
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,900
Because our bitmap drawing code right now doesn't support that and so

588
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,500
that's going to be like animations going to be this nice thing where

589
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,300
there's all these requirements we generate and then that's going to

590
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,800
lead replacing the renter were like okay we know we need scaling, we

591
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
know we need rotation and then we you know know what we have to build

592
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,200
for the renderer so I think we probably want to put animation off

593
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,100
until basically the last thing we do before the renderer and the

594
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,800
renderer probably

595
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Is the last thing we do before we start actual coding.

596
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,100
So the game goes here, right is what I would say.

597
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,700
So the game, I would say, we probably also want to push off the entity

598
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,900
system until then because the entity system is going to come up

599
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,500
concurrent with the game.

600
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,600
And so I would say that like,

601
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,700
Really the only stuff we need about the a system right now is all the

602
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,800
scalability stuff and how that sort of goes and so probably, what

603
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,000
we'll do is we'll leave our piggy entity right now are giant entity

604
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,100
thing that doesn't really do anything in terms of being smart about

605
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,700
anything.

606
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,900
We'll just leave that and then so basically the entity system will be

607
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,000
what we do this.

608
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,200
You know, the game we start doing the game, you know, World Generation

609
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,600
and the entity system will kind of come up together as we build that

610
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:18,900
game.

611
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,500
And those will be components that, you know,

612
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,500
Evolving continuously, throughout that time right now for World

613
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,300
Generation, we do need one thing up here before we do any of this

614
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,300
stuff which is like rudimentary World Jen.

615
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:44,400
So basically no quality, just what sorts of things.

616
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,400
We do.

617
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,200
And so right now we have essentially no ability to generate world's

618
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,000
whatsoever.

619
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,900
We just make a bunch of connected rooms.

620
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,700
So what we would want to do, here is a rudimentary World.

621
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,300
Jen that basically did what we need to do to actually make real world

622
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,500
stuff.

623
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,600
So if we look out here, right,

624
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,100
We don't have any ground cover.

625
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,000
The trees are all in a weird line.

626
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,700
Like, you know, it's there like wall rooms, you know, it doesn't make

627
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,300
any sense.

628
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,300
We don't have any notion of like where stuff is or any of that stuff.

629
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,700
So we'd want to make a screen that looked sort of like, the game

630
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,700
should look with trees and rocks, placed in the in reasonable.

631
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,500
You know, not like using good algorithms, but just some trees, some

632
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
rocks, some grass down there.

633
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,200
So it was like, a full looking screen so we know roughly what we have

634
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,500
to do to make that happen.

635
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,900
so that

636
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,600
we want that so that we at least know how that's going to work roughly

637
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,100
so that when we do World Generation, what we're focusing on here is

638
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,600
just going to be okay in this particular situation World Generation,

639
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,800
we're just focusing on how do we make algorithm?

640
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,000
That generate the kinds of Worlds that we want and that will come up

641
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,600
with any system?

642
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,800
But not how do we actually write the code?

643
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,400
To support World Jen, right?

644
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,500
So we probably want to do that here, right?

645
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,500
And that'll do stuff like placement of background things,

646
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,200
connectivity.

647
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,000
Probably just, you know, non-overlapping things like that.

648
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Just some basic stuff.

649
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,800
So we know what has to happen.

650
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,100
So that we make sure that our structures of things support the kinds

651
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
of careers that we need.

652
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay, so I already said we needed some AI stuff here.

653
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,200
Right.

654
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
So we need like pathfinding

655
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:43,000
And then we I guess need like a i storage for lack of a better term

656
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,700
but you know, for things that are supposed to have some agency in the

657
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
world, we're going to need some notion of what it is that they're

658
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,900
trying to do at any given time, right?

659
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,500
And those might be variably sized.

660
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Like if a guy has some goals, he's trying to accomplish or whatever

661
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,500
standard sorts of things, you know, you might see in a game, eai

662
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,400
We probably want to figure out, you know, what do we have a plan for

663
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:09,600
that?

664
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,100
Is there anything we need to plan for that?

665
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,400
Or is it just, hey, there's a linked list somewhere or whatever like

666
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,199
doing is there?

667
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Is there anything special we have to do to make that happen?

668
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,100
Just make sure that there isn't anything strange and weird there that

669
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,000
we got to deal with.

670
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,500
Yeah.

671
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,000
So that all looks good.

672
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,699
Collision detection, we sort of got the Collision detection problem,

673
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
which is hey, you know, on collision detection.

674
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,400
Do we need entry exit, right.

675
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:57,200
What about what's, what's the plan for robustness?

676
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,000
So we don't get stuck in things that sort of stuff and and I guess

677
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,200
shape definition, you know, we don't know exactly how we want to do

678
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,800
that.

679
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,100
So that's something.

680
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,300
Let's think about what else we got here.

681
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,200
It's nice to have this list so we can basically kind of look at all

682
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,400
the things that we need to do.

683
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,900
We've got some stuff.

684
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,400
Oh, I guess.

685
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,700
One thing.

686
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,400
Do is Implement multiple SIM regions per frame, right?

687
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,500
So basically like get, you know, a rudimentary thing going where we've

688
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,800
got these images and now, that's in multiple things.

689
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,600
And in that would be entity, you know, per entity clocking, right?

690
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,400
So, we know when things have been updated, and how far they need to

691
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,500
get updated for each individual step and and maybe Sim region merging

692
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,900
for multiple players.

693
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,700
Right?

694
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,400
So if you imagine two players are playing in their different places in

695
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,900
the world and they come close together and we want to simulate them in

696
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,300
one region, maybe so, you know, I don't know.

697
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,000
Stuff like that.

698
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,800
It's pretty easy for us to merge those things.

699
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,700
Yeah, I'm not sure.

700
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,900
What else do we got here?

701
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,400
What am I forgetting?

702
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,900
What am I forgetting?

703
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,900
Let's think if I were playing this game.

704
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,900
Yeah, I just kind of I guess we have one sort of thing which is

705
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,500
metagame save game, right?

706
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,100
Which is basically just saying like Okay, we need some story about

707
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,400
Do we even, you know, do even allow savegames.

708
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,600
Do we allow save games probably?

709
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,000
Yes, right.

710
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:57,000
Just not just only for pausing basically.

711
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,800
So since this game is supposed to be, you know, Rogue alike right.

712
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,400
We don't want the user to be able to actually save their game

713
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,600
volitional e, but we may want them to be able to, like close

714
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,500
The game in the middle of playing and then come back later and

715
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,100
continue.

716
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:21,000
So, you know, we might want that or, and, or crash recovery as well,

717
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,500
right?

718
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,400
Like, if the game crashed because remember, even if we do a perfect

719
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,800
job and have no crash bugs in the game when we ship it, there's always

720
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,400
the graphics driver to go ahead and help you out and crash anyway.

721
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,300
so, it's usually nice if you can

722
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,500
To build something into the game where if it crashes, because even if

723
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,800
it's, you know, like I said, there is no way to ensure Windows game.

724
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,200
For example, won't crash, because even if you're perfect somehow

725
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,500
you've made a perfect program, someone else will just go ahead and

726
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,200
crash for you.

727
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
So it's nice.

728
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,000
If we can maybe save the game periodically in some nice way.

729
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,100
So, like continuous save for crash recovery would be a nice feature to

730
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,800
have because it means that especially if you want to scale the game up

731
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,400
to 20 hours of play time for tea.

732
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,300
As a play time, if we do weird stuff like long and generate huge

733
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,900
worlds to take a really long time to play.

734
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,800
It would be nice for the person to know that 30 hours in the only way

735
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,800
they can lose all that work is if they're bad at the game and die, and

736
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,200
not because the graphics driver crashed, right?

737
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,600
So be nice if they could load up and only be like one room back from

738
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,500
where they were, you know, a couple, you know, you know, 30 seconds or

739
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,100
a minute back from where they were just something that allows that

740
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,300
would kind of be nice, right?

741
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,800
So thinking about how we want to do, you know, persistent online

742
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Locks etcetera, right?

743
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,700
Thinking about how we want this structure to work.

744
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,400
That's something that we probably want in the game for sure.

745
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:57,100
And so just, you know, it's not anything magical, but it would just be

746
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,400
nice to kind of go through and go.

747
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,900
Let's think about how

748
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Going to handle this because we do have some kind of nasty elements of

749
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,900
that, like are saved games might be huge, right?

750
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,700
Because if we generate the whole world every time,

751
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,200
And that world may be fairly expensive to generate and the user may be

752
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,300
able to modify large amounts of things in the world.

753
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,600
We do have some things, you know, we may have to do some creative

754
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,500
stuff there, it may not be obvious how to make all that work, well,

755
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,100
right?

756
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,800
At the very least, even if we have a giant save file like, hey, for a

757
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,000
giant world, you know, the savegame files, 60 megabytes or whatever,

758
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,400
right?

759
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,300
Even if we do that, we

760
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,600
And say that's just the way it is.

761
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,900
So forget Cloud saves right, the save game file on the local machine

762
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
for saving that play session.

763
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,100
If even if we do that, we wouldn't be able to save continuously 60

764
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,000
megabytes of data.

765
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,200
That's too much traffic.

766
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,700
Probably to not impact the framerate at all.

767
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,500
So, what we'd want to do is maybe only save incrementally or

768
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:07,900
something.

769
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,000
Like, we'd want to have some smart stuff that did like.

770
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,700
Okay, we only update the part of the save game.

771
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,200
We actually need to update or something like

772
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,000
This right.

773
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,700
And so, I don't know.

774
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,000
So that's one way to think about it.

775
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,400
And the other thing is, you know, we probably want to split them apart

776
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,600
because if we have to have giant, save files to support huge

777
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,000
modifiable worlds, or something like that, then we certainly don't

778
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
want the persistent stuff to be part of that, because we would want

779
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,300
the persistent stuff like unlocks to be part of a cloud save system,

780
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,100
which isn't going to want to upload, 60 MB every time, right?

781
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,600
So we'd want to split that off so that, you know, your Steam account

782
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,800
or something, whatever can sink your persistent part, at the very

783
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,700
least because we know we could make that small because the number of

784
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,000
like unlocks or whatever, is it going to be 60 megabytes, that's going

785
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,800
to be, you know, you know, 200k or something at, you know, worst-case,

786
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,300
right?

787
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,600
So yeah.

788
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So got most of the stuff here, let's seek out the metagame.

789
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,600
We've got.

790
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:20,700
So we've got a I so let me know rudimentary monstar Behavior example.

791
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,300
So all right you know what else we got Z.

792
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:34,000
So we want to clean up things by using Vector 3, we want to figure out

793
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,500
how you go up.

794
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,000
And down.

795
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,000
And how is this rendered, right?

796
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,100
Like how do we show going into something going and or going up?

797
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,500
It

798
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,600
You know, and it might be interesting to to ask people on the stream

799
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,900
people who have played a lot of games might be interesting to ask to

800
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,700
what are good examples of games 2D.

801
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,800
Where you can go up and down stuff and it looks good to do it.

802
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,400
You know, like I think about Binding of Isaac or something.

803
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
They really, you can't ever really go up.

804
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,000
So they never have to deal with the fact that you walk upstairs and

805
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
then switch to another level or something.

806
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,400
And you can't really go down either because when you go down something

807
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,600
it just shows us a little like jump up and go animation and then it

808
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,700
just cuts so they never really show you going down into something

809
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,200
either.

810
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,900
And so I don't know like render wise how we want to what we want.

811
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,600
To show in terms of somebody walking up a stairs or something, you

812
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,800
know, what do we want to do?

813
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,600
Obviously we can do something real cheesy, where you just, you know,

814
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,900
touch the stairs and instantly, you're on the next screen or

815
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,500
something.

816
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,300
But is there some better rendering, like some better way of animating

817
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,500
that that looks nicer or something?

818
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,200
You know, what do we want?

819
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:46,600
Think of?

820
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,300
Is there a game that did it particularly?

821
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,300
Well, that we should be looking to, for guidance, you know, that sort

822
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:51,600
of thing.

823
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,300
So there's that.

824
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So yeah, we want to kind of get our Z situation.

825
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
That's not particularly hard, but it's something we should go through

826
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,300
and do trying to think

827
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,700
What else we got here?

828
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,400
Architecture.

829
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,000
Exploration is here.

830
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,300
And then this is you know, production basically.

831
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,200
What do you guys think?

832
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,200
Am I forgetting stuff?

833
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,700
Am I forgetting stuff?

834
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,500
And I don't, I don't know.

835
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,600
I would say out of these things, you know, some of them are big, some

836
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,500
of them are small.

837
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,000
I would basically say that that's, that's a pretty rough one.

838
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,500
I'm not sure how we're going to do it.

839
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,100
That's pretty tough I would say.

840
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,800
Yeah, I would say this one's probably going to be a pretty big one.

841
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:08,300
These are probably not except maybe this one will see.

842
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,200
Yeah, yeah.

843
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,000
So let's say we've got got some hard work to do here, some of this is

844
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,300
pretty easy.

845
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,200
Some of its not if anyone I should check the stream, o.o audio.

846
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,800
Yeah.

847
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,000
Somebody said audio.

848
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:28,900
so,

849
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,100
Got sound effect triggers ambient sounds and music.

850
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,600
I guess are things, we should sort of get in there audios usually

851
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,800
pretty trivial, it's just not that hard, especially not in a game like

852
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,300
this one.

853
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:53,500
Where, let's be honest, we don't have a huge budget for this game so

854
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,300
we don't need to do something like make a huge Studio editing system

855
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,800
where people can dial all kinds of crazy, dials and have weird

856
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,500
Facts of stuff.

857
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,700
It's like, you know, we're going to have the money for basically

858
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,800
buying sound effects that play, When the Game needs them to play and

859
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,000
music that plays, you know, an ambient sounds like, oh, there's

860
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,900
running water, we play the running water, right?

861
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:18,200
We're not going to have the ability to have like a sound guy.

862
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,600
Be sitting there doing all kinds of sound scaping stuff for needs to

863
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,100
happen so we're probably not going to have that much work to do on

864
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,400
audio, you know, will support the basics and then we'll be able to

865
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,900
kind of put the assets in but there's

866
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,800
Not going to probably be a whole lot more than that.

867
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Although I guess we could play around with some of it later.

868
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,000
There's always places to add stuff but yeah, we need the basic audio.

869
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,600
What else?

870
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
What else we got?

871
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,500
I should take a look at the stream here and see if anyone else has

872
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
ideas ideas.

873
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,900
Doesn't look like anyone else mentioning anything in particular on

874
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,400
there.

875
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
So we go through it one more time, make sure we've got everything.

876
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Which of the metagame we can go, I guess.

877
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,700
So one thing.

878
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,900
Yes, we start up.

879
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,600
We've got the metagame, they're sort of, I guess there's sort of a

880
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,000
so,

881
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,800
In the metagame I guess there's one of the thing we might think about.

882
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:53,100
So, there's kind of the concept of you know, how do you enter a save

883
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,300
slot or whatever?

884
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:55,600
Like

885
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,300
This kind of this concept when you start playing, you know do I want

886
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,500
to have multiple versions of my like this persistent unlocks and stuff

887
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,000
right?

888
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,300
What if I want more than one version of those persistent unlocks the

889
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,100
simplest example.

890
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:20,600
Being if I'm playing on the same game you know as as Garland oh Bloom

891
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,300
because we are sharing computer you know like it's the living room

892
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,600
computer or something and

893
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,100
And he and I are like both want to play this game and were like, let's

894
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,300
do this, but he wants to keep his savegame separate from mine so that

895
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,000
he can unlock stuff separately from me, or whatever, right?

896
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,100
And we can, each play the game without having to play the other

897
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,200
person, say file.

898
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:50,100
So if we go in there and you know, do that, what's a, what's a, what

899
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,800
does that impact?

900
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,300
The implications for that in the game?

901
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,600
How do we make sure we keep those separate and what's the way that

902
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,500
they get picked?

903
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:56,800
Because

904
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,900
Has maybe we want the game, maybe we want that to all work.

905
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,600
Games, there's not like a menu, it just kind of like, you know, you

906
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,700
have your character than the first thing you do is move to, you know,

907
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,000
that you can imagine like, a spatial version where you like, walk down

908
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,300
three, there's three different stairs or something and you go down the

909
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,600
one, that's the save slot that you wanted to play on.

910
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,500
If we want to do something like that, there has to kind of be this

911
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:24,400
notion of multiple worldy things where it's like, we're in a world

912
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,000
that isn't really a real world.

913
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's a world that for picking worlds, and then we picked one and now

914
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,800
we have that were right.

915
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,700
Right, there's this kind of thing that goes on there that creates

916
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,700
complexity in the code.

917
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,600
And so we probably, before we go any further to would want that to

918
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,600
work properly.

919
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,100
Right?

920
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,600
So that's will get that in there as well.

921
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,200
Let's see anything else.

922
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,800
Any in-game you?

923
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,500
I needed.

924
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,200
Hopefully not.

925
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
I hate in-game you.

926
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,600
I I'm so I'm hoping that we won't have any in-game UI.

927
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,900
That's my, that's my hope.

928
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,600
I mean we may float a few things I guess.

929
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,700
That's one thing we could do which is like just a floating thing for.

930
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,100
Well, you know I'm hoping we don't have any I guess that's what I'd

931
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:11,500
say.

932
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,200
I'm hoping that we don't have any of that so I'm just going to see if

933
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,300
we can get away without it.

934
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,700
Logging should be on the list so I guess.

935
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,400
Yeah, debugging write, debug code should be on the list.

936
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:30,600
So, yeah, logging diagramming switches sliders that sort of thing,

937
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,500
right?

938
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,100
Some kind of stuff for getting debugging working.

939
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,400
Let's see.

940
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:49,300
Can we please do gooey?

941
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,200
So I guess we'll do a little gooey here.

942
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,800
We'll do a little

943
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:57,300
Gooey.

944
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,600
But only a little, because games.

945
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,800
Games with gooey are.

946
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,900
I don't really like

947
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,300
So, I don't know.

948
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,500
I mean, I feel like we'll do, you know, if you want to do handmade

949
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,400
some point, you do handmade like a RollerCoaster Tycoon or one of

950
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,700
those old games that had like tons of Windows that with that, where it

951
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,800
was like, it looks like some kind of a nap, right?

952
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
That's where you kind of want to do the GUI coating but so we'll see.

953
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,400
But yeah, Maps is a good point.

954
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,400
Maps is a good one.

955
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,900
I'm not sure how we want to do maps.

956
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I wonder if we could.

957
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,700
Yeah, Maps is interesting.

958
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,300
Maps is very interesting.

959
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,400
Yeah, let's go ahead and add that.

960
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,700
App display.

961
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,300
Magnets, how they work?

962
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,600
So basically yeah map display.

963
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,700
I thought a little bit about that and that actually may be a

964
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,800
technological problem.

965
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,500
Meaning maybe we really do kind of want to think about that a little

966
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:17,800
bit.

967
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,000
And I'm going to go ahead and put that underneath rudimentary real Jen

968
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,400
like so.

969
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,400
Because I do have some thoughts about that.

970
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,500
And so, yeah, let's think about that.

971
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,700
Will you be carrying multiple items?

972
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,400
So, yeah, my I've got ideas about how I want to do that.

973
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,200
Let's put it that way.

974
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,200
So I think we can get away with very little UI in the game if none at

975
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,500
all.

976
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,400
But yeah, we'll get to that part later.

977
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,900
I don't think map is a good point.

978
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,300
And map is a thing that's Q&A time.

979
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,400
I think, I think we're done mostly with this.

980
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,800
Because it's a pretty good list.

981
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,900
Yeah, so let's sort lets you know, I started a little late so let's

982
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,700
just take a couple minutes and let's sort this because we're starting

983
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,500
fresh next week.

984
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,600
I've see will be starting Monday time for a new topic.

985
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,400
Let's think about what we want to do here.

986
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:27,200
So I would say that like Z and multiple SIM regions is kind of an

987
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,500
example of cleaning up, sort of stuff.

988
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:38,700
So I think I might say, let's just do, let's do this stuff.

989
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,800
Let's do this stuff next week.

990
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:48,100
Maybe try to do some of this because we're going to take the week off

991
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:48,700
the following.

992
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,200
We know the first week of March, I said, we take off, give people a

993
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,400
chance to catch up and stuff.

994
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,600
I'm going to be traveling that week, so it'll be easy.

995
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,300
They'll be best for everyone because people have been asking for a

996
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,900
week off, they'll get a week off, I won't have to.

997
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,900
For how to stream from locations, where the internet might be even

998
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,700
less likely to get to Twitch than it is here.

999
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
So that might be a good one.

1000
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,400
So maybe we start with these next week because we don't want to start

1001
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,700
something big next week.

1002
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,100
Be right in the middle of it, and then take a week off, that seems

1003
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:14,600
bad.

1004
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,700
So maybe we stick with things that are just stuff.

1005
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,600
We've already done that, we just need to clean up.

1006
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,800
Get them off the list, get them done, right?

1007
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,500
So maybe we break it up, we try to do that.

1008
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,700
And then, you know, if we break in the middle of that and for a week

1009
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,900
it doesn't matter because these are things.

1010
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
We've already mostly done.

1011
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,100
So we're just kind of like updating them and that that would be fine,

1012
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,700
right?

1013
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,900
Then if we take a look at this stuff, I guess I would say metagame and

1014
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,400
save game maybe would be a good thing to think about.

1015
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
They kind of go together with rudimentary Royal gen like you know

1016
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,500
right like making worlds and

1017
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,200
And how we persist things that's kind of to me, those kind of go

1018
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,700
together, right?

1019
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,800
Audio is just totally a separate thing.

1020
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:06,000
As is debug code, these are totally separate entirely separate.

1021
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:25,400
So maybe we put, maybe we put these up here and, you know, like that

1022
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,300
maybe we'd be do debug cut enough.

1023
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,800
I really care about doing debug code that early on

1024
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,600
It's hard to say.

1025
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,300
It's really hard to say.

1026
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:35,900
Yeah.

1027
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,000
All right.

1028
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,000
And then we would sort of do it in this order.

1029
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,500
This would be, this would be the order.

1030
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,000
I don't know what you guys think about this.

1031
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,700
So basically, we do this stuff which I don't think I'll be too much

1032
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,300
work.

1033
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Pretty straightforward.

1034
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,300
This would be creating all new code which is just stuff that allows us

1035
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,800
to debug our stuff more easily.

1036
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,100
This would sort of be finishing up that Collision detection code.

1037
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,800
I wonder if

1038
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,300
I feel like that's probably a little bit more of a cleanup thing to,

1039
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,400
so maybe let's let's let's do it in this order, right.

1040
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,900
So here's our clean up stuff, right?

1041
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,500
And maybe maybe we do that first because I don't like leaving it

1042
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,000
broken and we sort of haven't really finished that stuff.

1043
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,700
So maybe we just kind of do one more pass in the Collision detection.

1044
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,400
Get that stuff.

1045
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,100
Feeling good, right?

1046
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,300
Then we do this stuff, we do this stuff.

1047
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,300
Yeah.

1048
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,800
I like I like, I like the way this is.

1049
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,000
Galloping, let's move AI down to here.

1050
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,300
So that, that kind of dovetails into the animation system and well.

1051
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,700
Okay, yeah.

1052
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,800
And and AI in the, the world Jen kind of go together to because the

1053
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,800
pathfinding may have to, kind of understand some of those things.

1054
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,000
All right?

1055
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,300
So that that's looking pretty reasonable.

1056
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,800
Yeah, I like that.

1057
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,400
That looks like a pretty good hit list.

1058
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
I feel like by the time that we got through all of this stuff we would

1059
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,200
basically have what amounts to a completely playable engine thing, you

1060
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,200
know, that's pretty decent actually, and that certain components are

1061
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,200
not industrial strength

1062
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,100
But we'd be in perfect position to go ahead and start doing exactly

1063
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,500
that which is going through and making things industrial-strength.

1064
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:31,900
So we started on the renderer, which is the only real huge one and

1065
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,200
then we could actually go through and do you know, do it for reals?

1066
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,800
That seems pretty good.

1067
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,400
I could see that can see that being good.

1068
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,700
All right, so I'm happy with that.

1069
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,000
Let's go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1070
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,400
I don't know.

1071
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,400
They'll be much Q&A today because of the fact that basically what we

1072
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
did is sort of do our planning.

1073
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,900
But, you know,

1074
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,500
I can't predict whether they'll be cure or not.

1075
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,300
So I'll go ahead and hit the little Q&A button.

1076
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,100
Is please prefix your questions with Q: so I can see them and please.

1077
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,800
Well you know what, I don't even care just ask whatever questions you

1078
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,800
want today but I reserve the right to say that something is a pre

1079
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,700
stream question into a skit on pre stream instead.

1080
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,300
Yeah, go ahead and leave that up there.

1081
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,600
Isn't doing this list thinking, too.

1082
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,700
Far ahead are thinking too far according to your compression oriented

1083
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,200
programming.

1084
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,300
You look ahead with this table for weeks ahead.

1085
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,200
No, because I often do stuff like this.

1086
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,400
I don't feel like this really has anything to do with the programming.

1087
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,600
If that makes sense.

1088
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,500
This is just listing the things.

1089
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,000
We know we would need to have right, so this isn't a schedule.

1090
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,200
We don't have to stick to this in any way but it's just like guidance.

1091
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,100
It's like okay what do we do?

1092
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,000
Like I was at a point today where I was like, I'm not

1093
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,400
What we do next, this is just a list we can come back to any time,

1094
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,500
we're at that point, where were like, okay, we finished thing X, we're

1095
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,000
pretty happy with where it is.

1096
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,100
We don't think we need to go any further on it right now.

1097
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,200
What do we do next?

1098
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,400
We can just pull something off the list, right?

1099
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,600
So we go back to the list and go, what else we got?

1100
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,400
Oh, right.

1101
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,500
We know we wanted to, you know, get Z handling.

1102
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,400
Let's go start looking at Sea handling, right?

1103
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,800
And so definitely don't think of this list as something we have to do

1104
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,400
in order.

1105
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,900
At any time, you can go ahead and ignore this entirely.

1106
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:28,000
All right, it's just sitting there as sort of a brain dump where we're

1107
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
like these are all the things that are gonna have to get done at some

1108
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:31,700
point.

1109
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,100
So that we just kind of don't forget them, right?

1110
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,900
And I just kind of wanted to get that out there.

1111
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,100
So yeah, so definitely don't think of this as something that has to be

1112
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,500
adhered to and I pretty much in guarantee you that it won't be like

1113
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,800
they'll be plenty of things in here where we're like, oh we started

1114
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,100
working construction and we noticed this thing.

1115
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,000
Let's go do that or whatever, but just kind of was a nice little plan

1116
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,500
where I can can say.

1117
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,000
Okay now I know all the

1118
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,400
Major areas.

1119
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,400
So when we get to a point and we're not sure what we should do next,

1120
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,200
we just grab something and say.

1121
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,700
Alright, let's do that because we've sort of said, oh yeah, we

1122
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,100
probably should do that at some point.

1123
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,200
In the get, hash from Storage index function, you do some bit

1124
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,400
twiddling to map.

1125
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,200
Hash value into hash index.

1126
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,100
Is there a reason that you didn't just compute hash index, as hash

1127
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,700
index equals hash value mod array count.

1128
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,300
Yes.

1129
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:36,300
So mod is very expensive, compared to.

1130
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,900
And so, basically, a mod requires integer division, right?

1131
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,400
And integer division is slow compared to an end.

1132
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,100
In and is usually one of the fastest operations, the CPU can do.

1133
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,500
It's rare that like an and takes really any time at all.

1134
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,600
And so for the most part

1135
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,900
reason to avoid mod is because you don't want, if the whole point of

1136
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,900
the thing that you're doing is to make accesses quick, you typically

1137
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,800
don't want to have a mod in there now,

1138
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:18,300
That said really, we don't know which one is the most appropriate for

1139
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,500
any given situation.

1140
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,700
So just to show the example of the person was talking about they were

1141
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,800
saying this, right?

1142
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,400
Hash bucket.

1143
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,000
Why are we doing it?

1144
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,200
And instead of a mod

1145
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,700
And so really, we don't know, because it may be that using a, non

1146
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:40,400
power of 2 size is better for a particular circumstance, because if,

1147
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,800
when you do this, look up, if this stuff isn't in the cache, then it's

1148
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,500
probably true that the mod cost is not expensive enough to matter,

1149
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,600
right?

1150
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,400
Because the memory fetching to get the hash table into memory.

1151
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,300
If it wasn't in the cache at the time is

1152
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,100
To dominate that runtime, right?

1153
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,100
And so really this is just, I tend to write them as Anne's to begin

1154
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,600
with just to make sure that I'm not relying on mod, but sometimes when

1155
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,900
we go back in there, we might decide that mod is fine.

1156
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,900
And that it's that we would rather have the non power of 2 sighs for

1157
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,700
some other reason.

1158
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
And so really the answer is just, it's a trade-off.

1159
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:25,300
It's a trade-off between complete flexibility of sizing versus the

1160
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,700
cost to the CPU to compute the hash bucket,

1161
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,600
And trade-offs like that or not something we really can make up front.

1162
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,800
We have to see how they run in practice on our Target platforms.

1163
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,200
And then the side chances are

1164
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,500
This will not really be an important part of the program.

1165
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,600
Anyway, and really, you could probably use both either one because

1166
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,100
chances are we just won't be dealing with Collision rules enough to

1167
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,300
make them be an important part of the runtime cost of the system, but

1168
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,100
it's worth understanding those trade-offs anyway, because sometimes

1169
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,800
they are sometimes your hash tables are very important.

1170
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,800
So that's just something to think about.

1171
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,700
And that's, that's why I tend to write them this way and also, because

1172
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,900
obviously, I learned programming at a time when the cost was far more

1173
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,700
exaggerated than it is.

1174
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:20,700
Now when obviously, when I started programming, the concept that you

1175
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,800
would do an integer, divide ever was kind of ludicrous, like you never

1176
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,700
ever, ever, ever wanted to do an integer divided into divide was a

1177
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,800
disaster because in those days memory accesses

1178
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,600
It was a similar cost to doing an instruction memory, wasn't the super

1179
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,800
slow thing, compared to the processor that it is now.

1180
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:46,100
And so, you know, you had these situations, we're doing a mod,

1181
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,500
literally meant that, you know, the code got 40 times slower or

1182
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,400
something, right?

1183
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,800
Because it was so expensive to do that that divide or something.

1184
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,700
Whereas, now that's not necessarily the case, because things don't

1185
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,300
work that way.

1186
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:04,000
And so, the trade-off change and again, the only really way to know is

1187
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,200
to have a good sense of what your target platforms.

1188
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,000
Are am actually test to see if you care,

1189
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Right now, the familiar lags behind since move slower than the player.

1190
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,000
There may be, many legitimate situations where the player and the

1191
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:26,500
familiar may be.

1192
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,300
Separated have you considered implementing a proportional?

1193
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,900
Integral derivative controller for its speed.

1194
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,200
Well again we're not trying to code a familiar at this point, right?

1195
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,100
We just wanted something in there so we can see what the architecture

1196
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,800
should look like.

1197
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,100
We don't need to make a good familiar because that'll be for later on

1198
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,500
when we have the whole game running and we're implementing the

1199
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,200
familiars and how we

1200
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,300
Nothing to work for Chanel.

1201
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,300
Integral derivative controllers are interesting, except they do have

1202
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,200
some drawbacks and so you know, we'll probably use them for some

1203
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,800
things.

1204
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,900
I don't know about the integral part is usually not as interesting for

1205
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,500
games.

1206
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,900
Proportional derivative controller, as are usually more fun because

1207
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,300
they have sort of a little more springy.

1208
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,300
Unpredictable behavior.

1209
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,400
That usually is a little more fun and games.

1210
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,800
So proportional derivative controller might be more likely than

1211
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,300
proportional.

1212
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,200
Integral derivative controller like the

1213
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:24,100
Integral term we probably wouldn't use but also for things that we

1214
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,700
want to have very predictable, Behavior, proportional, integral

1215
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,400
derivative controllers.

1216
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,800
Actually, probably also aren't what I would use for that.

1217
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:36,600
I would probably use sort of direct direct spline interpolation.

1218
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,900
So hard to say but that's coming down the road.

1219
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:45,700
My connection drop.

1220
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,100
Could you briefly go over the solution for the kitchen table again?

1221
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,300
Actually you can just watch it on YouTube.

1222
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,900
These get uploaded immediately after so you can watch Day 70 again and

1223
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,300
see my complete explanation.

1224
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,100
Do we have to do, is eat or Z?

1225
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,000
Sorting for a game like this.

1226
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,600
Can't we just sort on the y-axis and do things to simulate climbing,

1227
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,900
stairs, change the velocity as the character moves up, something like

1228
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,000
stairs, and what have you?

1229
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,900
So, that's what I mean, when I say Z, sorting though is sorting on the

1230
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,200
y-axis.

1231
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:20,600
Obviously, once you sort on the y-axis, though, like once we do the

1232
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:25,000
Sorting to handle the fact that, you know, I should be behind these

1233
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,500
trees instead of in front of them once we do that.

1234
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,200
Sort.

1235
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:29,000
It's free.

1236
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,300
Usually for us to also sort by Z correctly as well.

1237
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:37,200
Because you know when you're doing a sort, you can make the sort, be

1238
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,400
the sort comparison be compound.

1239
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,600
It doesn't just have to sort on one thing, so we'll get Z sorting for

1240
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
free when we do the, why sorting as well, probably.

1241
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,600
So the problem isn't so much the Sorting though, the problem is what

1242
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,000
should happen when the guy goes up and down stairs.

1243
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,300
Like what do we want to look like, right?

1244
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,400
It's a presentation issue.

1245
01:05:59,500 --> 01:05:59,800
Not a

1246
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,600
What issue?

1247
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,700
I'm sure we'll be able to code whatever it is.

1248
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,900
We said to think about what it should look like when it goes up and

1249
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,100
down the stairs, like like, how does that work?

1250
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,700
You know, it's just kind of go up them a little and then it flips to

1251
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,700
the next one or it's just, it's what should it look like, you know,

1252
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:14,600
and I'm not sure.

1253
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,700
I heard you talking about animation see right down a skeletal system.

1254
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,200
Do you have plans on importing from a premade program or making an

1255
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,900
animation program for the artists to use?

1256
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,600
So I don't know whether we'll just kind of make the animation be

1257
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,700
procedural mostly, which I think is probably what we'll do.

1258
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,200
But I also I noticed this thing.

1259
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,900
Where is it?

1260
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,200
Yeah, this thing looked kind of interesting.

1261
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,400
It was like a little skeletal animation thing, that was pretty cheap,

1262
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,300
there's like 60 bucks and there's a free version so people would be

1263
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,900
able to do simple things in it without having to pay as well.

1264
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,400
So that seemed like a potentially,

1265
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:20,100
Uh, potentially reasonable tool to import from because it could do

1266
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,700
skeletal animation authoring and then we could load it right?

1267
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,100
But I don't know that will actually use any authored animations.

1268
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,700
If we do, that's probably what I look at that was the tool that came

1269
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,700
to mind because I saw that that was released recently and looked like

1270
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:37,500
a low-cost thing that could output data files that we could use for

1271
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,000
the game, but I don't know that we actually will need that.

1272
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,500
It may be that all of our animation is always procedural.

1273
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,500
So, I don't know.

1274
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:48,700
We'll see.

1275
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,200
For the list superfish.

1276
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,100
So superfish, I have a text file on computer which has all of my game

1277
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:08,700
design things that I want in the game in super fish is already on

1278
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,000
there.

1279
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,400
I added it when I tweeted about it the other day.

1280
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,100
So so there will be a superfish enemy and I think what we'll try to do

1281
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,600
at the superfish enemy, my thought about that was the superfish enemy

1282
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,000
will be like a mimic, like indirect Dungeons and Dragons like, you

1283
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,800
know, a chest that attacks you or whatever.

1284
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:27,600
It'll basically

1285
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,000
Do you like, it'll impersonate other things?

1286
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,700
And because that's basically, you know, it's basically root

1287
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,500
certificate of you.

1288
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,300
So it'll impersonate things and then turn into a monster.

1289
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:45,100
When you try to use those things that you normally would that to me is

1290
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:45,800
super fish.

1291
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,899
Asset loading management is missing from the list.

1292
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,800
You are correct.

1293
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,700
That is a good one.

1294
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,300
Thank you.

1295
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,600
Where's my handmade .h?

1296
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,000
There it is.

1297
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,600
That is a good one, so we totally should do that.

1298
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,500
How do we want to do that?

1299
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,800
So we probably want to do that.

1300
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,100
Probably want to do that in here.

1301
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,800
Asset streaming that in there.

1302
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:32,899
Yeah.

1303
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,500
What 2-D game.

1304
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,000
Can you think of that did good Z movement?

1305
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,500
I personally always liked Prince of Persia.

1306
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,700
When he climbed the steps at the end of the level.

1307
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,600
I don't know that's why I was thinking like I can't think I'll go

1308
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,500
watch some Prince of Persia videos, I don't know, I None kind came to

1309
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,600
mind really actually

1310
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:03,100
Prince of Persia, doesn't is a little hard because Prince of Persia

1311
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,300
was not top down or isometric.

1312
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,500
So going up was much more logical to them because it was actually up

1313
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,100
on the screen was actual upright, so they had an easier time of it,

1314
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,100
where it's clearer.

1315
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,100
I think to the player, what's going on because there aren't three, you

1316
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,600
know, axes basically.

1317
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,100
Have I seen watch people co.com?

1318
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:39,500
Yes, someone sent it to me, I thought it was kind of funny, that's

1319
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:45,200
that, it started like a month or so after we started doing handmade

1320
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:51,500
hero and the things that they put on there, they've never put us on

1321
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:51,800
there.

1322
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:57,100
But we have way more viewers than anything that I saw on there.

1323
01:10:57,100 --> 01:11:01,300
So I feel like we're, I feel like we're being snubbed or something.

1324
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,400
I don't really feel like we're being snow.

1325
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,400
But it was kind of funny.

1326
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,100
I was like, well, alright, you could watch these people code, but

1327
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,200
we've got the real actions over here, on handmade here, on my friends.

1328
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,400
We know where the stuff that.

1329
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,700
What is your opinion on using existing code?

1330
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,500
Someone else wrote as a learning tool, totally fine.

1331
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,700
I actually don't have any problem with using like, I don't think it's

1332
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,100
anything wrong with using libraries or engines.

1333
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,300
That's just not the goal of this series, right?

1334
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:42,700
You know, I feel like there was too much of the sort of.

1335
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm not really sure how to program and I'm making a game in something

1336
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,600
going on.

1337
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,100
And so, I thought it was important to have a Counterpoint that was

1338
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,100
like, let's

1339
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:55,100
Something where we show how you actually can code everything because I

1340
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:59,200
feel like you want like both of those things especially because, you

1341
01:11:59,200 --> 01:11:59,900
know, I see a lot.

1342
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,600
Games.

1343
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,700
I play a lot of games where I'm like, it's pretty clear that the

1344
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,700
person who made this doesn't really know how to program at all.

1345
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,900
Because there's these obvious really bad programming mistakes in it.

1346
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,900
And the game would have been ten times better.

1347
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,700
If they just know how to do this one thing, it would have taken them

1348
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,900
like two hours to do this thing or whatever.

1349
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,400
Right?

1350
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,000
And you know instead it's this really bad experience as a result.

1351
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,700
And so I thought like it was important to put something out there with

1352
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:29,000
it was like hear a thing that shows how to do all the real coding for

1353
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:29,700
reals.

1354
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,600
With a z.

1355
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,400
So that maybe there'd be more information out there about that.

1356
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,400
Even when people go to use a premade engine or existing code, they

1357
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,500
know what's going on.

1358
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,700
So they can fix those obvious mistakes that I keep seeing games all

1359
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,100
the time.

1360
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,800
Now by people who just use an engine but don't really know how to

1361
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,900
program, you know, I'm so

1362
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,600
Spread his file format is completely open and documented.

1363
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,400
Yeah, exactly.

1364
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,400
So that's why I was thinking.

1365
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,300
It might be a good one to use.

1366
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,800
If we decide we need animations that are authored.

1367
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,800
But I think doing procedural animation is more interesting because

1368
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,200
it's more about code, which is what the series is about.

1369
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,800
So I feel like we may just want all our animation to be procedural.

1370
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,000
Do you want to have quests in the game?

1371
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,200
In this case, how are you planning to Define them?

1372
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,500
Well, that's, that's really more of a thing.

1373
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,900
When you're just building the game, that doesn't, that isn't really an

1374
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,100
architecture concern.

1375
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,700
To me, Lisa, doesn't sound like something that would imply much in the

1376
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,800
architecture that we wouldn't already have.

1377
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,500
So I don't think we need that to be in architecture.

1378
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:49,200
Exploration pass where everything sort of brought up and running.

1379
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,500
I don't I don't think that would really have any bearing on it,

1380
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:53,900
really?

1381
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,600
I think we dropped the check for entity.

1382
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,900
Equals hit entity, inclusion, code last time.

1383
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,400
Or did I miss something?

1384
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:21,500
No, you may be right because I think I may have forgotten to put it in

1385
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,000
the place where it should have gone.

1386
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,600
That's a good point.

1387
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,700
Let me double-check cuz I think I said I was going to put it somewhere

1388
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,100
in that I didn't actually put it somewhere.

1389
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:36,500
So when we do, this should Collide should have had it in here, and I

1390
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,400
think we may have forgotten to do that.

1391
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,900
So, yes, you're correct.

1392
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,000
This should have looked like that.

1393
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,200
So that we don't waste time checking against itself.

1394
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,800
So we only want to do Collision, if a equals, if a is a different

1395
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,200
entity than be, so that's a good thing.

1396
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:56,800
Yeah.

1397
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,000
Okay.

1398
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,800
Thank you for catching that.

1399
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,700
Will you patent the monstar pathfinding algorithm?

1400
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,900
Of course?

1401
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,200
You can't just make an algorithm, you have to patent the algorithm

1402
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,600
because you're so brilliant.

1403
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,800
That you've come up with this brand new algorithm.

1404
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,100
No one's ever thought of before, you should be the only person who can

1405
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,000
use it for 17 years.

1406
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,600
Yeah, I hate patents.

1407
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,000
In case you didn't know that, I think they're absolutely ridiculous.

1408
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,600
I have no idea.

1409
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,400
who came up with the idea, but

1410
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,300
Whoever came up with the idea for patents.

1411
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:42,800
Yeah.

1412
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,600
An idea that has ruined so many things.

1413
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:08,900
For Z axis movement, would it be feasible to resize the Sprite to be

1414
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:14,500
larger as they move up and then resize the Sprite to be smaller once

1415
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:19,500
it reaches the level while doing some Parallax stuff on the wall

1416
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,600
textures for the second resize.

1417
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,000
I don't know.

1418
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:28,600
I'm not sure.

1419
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,300
I know exactly what that would look like.

1420
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,100
What you're saying.

1421
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:47,600
I think making the guy get larger would be a little bit wrong because

1422
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,400
if you think about.

1423
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:52,200
So, if you think about what's happening here, right?

1424
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,400
Going upwards is not actually moving you closer to the camera.

1425
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,000
Really?

1426
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,100
Like that's going upwards, right?

1427
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,100
And that would not make sense if he got bigger there because it's kind

1428
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,300
of going like, what is this?

1429
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,100
Looks like it's sort of perpendicular to the camera as far as the

1430
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,200
viewers concerned.

1431
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:10,900
So I

1432
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,700
think scaling the guy up would really make sense if we were straight

1433
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,500
top down

1434
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,800
Then I think it would look correct to make the guy get bigger as he

1435
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,700
went up the stairs.

1436
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,800
But since we're kind of head on in that sort of Zelda e style where

1437
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,500
for some reason even though you're sort of top down, you're still

1438
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:33,900
seeing everyone side on who knows how this game convention happened,

1439
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,700
but that's how we do things in the game world, nowadays.

1440
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:42,800
I feel like that's probably not what we would want.

1441
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,100
Just my guess hard to say, though.

1442
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I think Pokemon 3rd, gen first, gen did, good stuff with the Z axis.

1443
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,400
what is 3rd gen / 1st Gen mean

1444
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,900
Post a link.

1445
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,200
If you can post a link to a video either on the handmade here, our

1446
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,500
forums, or on the chat here, if you happen to have it handy.

1447
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,400
So I can look at that because I don't know which I don't follow

1448
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,700
Pokemon super closely.

1449
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,400
so, I'm actually know that that one

1450
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Will the monster encounters be random based like Final Fantasy Dragon

1451
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,500
Warrior, or will they be more static Zelda, style Zelda style?

1452
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:46,900
So the idea is, you know, you walk around and fight monsters that are

1453
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:47,900
actually on the map.

1454
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:52,800
You're walking around on not like you kind of touch a sort of

1455
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,600
Representative monster and go into a monster battle.

1456
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,600
I was thinking that former not the latter,

1457
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,700
Should there be a time limit as well as a distance limit on the sword

1458
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,100
possibly.

1459
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,000
But that's much more straightforward to implement.

1460
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,900
That doesn't involve the clothes intact or anything.

1461
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,400
So if we want to add stuff like that later we can do that again.

1462
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,800
The sword was just an example object.

1463
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,100
We're not trying to make it good.

1464
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,100
We're just trying to do some stuff to see what would be necessary in

1465
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:32,900
the Collision system.

1466
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,800
So basically like, you know,

1467
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,400
I did the movement constraint because it basically puts something into

1468
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,500
the Collision architecture.

1469
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,400
Time constraint would be as simple as during the update called

1470
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,300
looking, how much time was left, which is really easy, right?

1471
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,700
So, I didn't really feel the need to test that, but it'd be pretty

1472
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,700
easy for us to put in.

1473
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,800
And I don't think it really has any bearing on on things.

1474
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,700
Minish Cap handles the Z actually.

1475
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,300
Well okay, I'll check out some Minish Cap videos.

1476
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,100
How exactly does your question sorting plug-in work?

1477
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:23,500
Basically it just anything with a q: or see me.

1478
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,100
Oratory or handmade hero?

1479
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,300
I think shows up on my screen.

1480
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,600
I believe Ultima Online did some stuff with Z axis, but I'm not sure

1481
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,100
if it's good though, you know, II saw I've solved my online back in

1482
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:48,000
the day, I never really played it myself, but I saw people play it at

1483
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,300
the gas powered games office, in fact, but I never really played it

1484
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:52,900
myself.

1485
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,900
They probably would have had a doozy stuff though, wouldn't, they have

1486
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:59,500
because they had houses I think that had like upper right like that,

1487
01:20:59,500 --> 01:20:59,800
you know,

1488
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,000
Upper, floors and stuff.

1489
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,600
And so they had to be able to go upstairs to get things in the

1490
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,200
downstairs.

1491
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,000
And so, yeah, I should probably take a look.

1492
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I don't you might be bad like you said, but at least I would know.

1493
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,600
What's the biggest game project?

1494
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,700
You personally worked on.

1495
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,500
Personally worked on, would have to be the witness because most of the

1496
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,500
games that have code in it, that I wrote was licensed.

1497
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,700
So I didn't work on the game directly write, like, you know, there are

1498
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:34,100
much bigger games that had my character animation system in them, when

1499
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,000
I worked at Rad, but I work on the game.

1500
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,200
I worked on the characteristic and then they license characters

1501
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,400
animations before the game.

1502
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,900
So the witness is probably the game that I've like, worked directly on

1503
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,100
code.

1504
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,000
That's only for that.

1505
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,300
I'm not licensed.

1506
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:48,100
That would be the one.

1507
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,200
That's the largest because that game is huge.

1508
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:55,000
Now, John is not kidding when he says it's big.

1509
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:55,700
It is

1510
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:01,800
It is a big game if you choose to try and solve everything it's not

1511
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,900
one of those games that forces you to solve everything.

1512
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,400
But if you choose to tackle all of the problems that it presents to

1513
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,800
you all the puzzles, it's huge

1514
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,800
no remark on handmade animations or did I miss that?

1515
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:23,200
So I don't consider animations being any more handmade just because

1516
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,300
they've been made in art tool.

1517
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:26,900
In fact I consider those less handmade because then there's a tool in

1518
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,100
between us in the animation so I feel like if we do procedural

1519
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,000
animations that's actually a lot more interesting code wise and a lot

1520
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,900
more handmade loading animations.

1521
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,700
From a tool is just an import problem.

1522
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,900
It's like can you parse a file format?

1523
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,800
We already showed how to do that with bmps so I'm not sure there's

1524
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,600
really and we'll do it.

1525
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:49,000
With web files at the very least for the sounds.

1526
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,800
And then we'll probably when we get to stuff when we get to shipping

1527
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,600
stuff, we'll have to do compression for assets because I'll be too

1528
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,100
big.

1529
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,700
So we'll have some more of that.

1530
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,300
So I'm not sure it's interesting to parse another file format.

1531
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,900
so, unless we find

1532
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,500
We really need to be able to import these animations.

1533
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,100
For some reason, it doesn't seem like an interesting aspect to me.

1534
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:25,200
I've been writing my own platform layer in my own code and I found

1535
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:29,200
that I've been poisoned by your approach, I have, I have poisoned

1536
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:29,700
somebody.

1537
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,600
Okay, by this.

1538
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,900
I've been heading down a path.

1539
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:35,800
Very similar to yours, simply through knowledge of a possible solution

1540
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,400
to it.

1541
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,500
This leads me to a very narrow way of thinking about problems.

1542
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,200
Do you run into this as well?

1543
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,200
How do you break through the wall?

1544
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,900
It takes me a very long time to get solutions that fit my needs when I

1545
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:47,000
see someone else's.

1546
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:57,500
Well, first of all a, it's very good question.

1547
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,800
I see what you're saying, you don't really mean poisoned in a bad way.

1548
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,000
You mean in some sense, you mean biased.

1549
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:12,700
I guess like you are biased towards a solution that I have presented

1550
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,800
because hey it's a solution and now you know, a solution.

1551
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,800
So when you go to do something, you use the solution that you know,

1552
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:24,800
and I am definitely not one of those people who believes that.

1553
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,000
I should tell you a solution and then you should go do the solution

1554
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,800
that I told you.

1555
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,800
That is definitely not the

1556
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,900
goal for this stream.

1557
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,900
The goal for this stream is to show you how to solve problems and to

1558
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,500
encourage you to solve them in whatever way you feel works best for

1559
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:37,900
you.

1560
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:42,000
That's totally, that would be my dream scenario of people coming away

1561
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,700
from the stream, not with a prescriptive list of do, X, Y and Z

1562
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:51,300
because Casey said so that is not so interesting, right?

1563
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,500
What's much more interesting is 0.

1564
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:56,700
We watched how Casey solve these problems, I get how to solve

1565
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,400
programming problems.

1566
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,800
Now, I'm going to go solve my own problems in my own way.

1567
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:00,900
Doing my own stuff.

1568
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,900
That's way better, right?

1569
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:04,600
Because now, you can solve problems that.

1570
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,900
I didn't show you how to solve.

1571
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,500
Now, you can solve problems, I did show you how to solve but in

1572
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,700
different ways and maybe get better Solutions or at least different

1573
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,400
solutions.

1574
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:16,900
You know, either one is fine because they kind of increase the options

1575
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:19,300
that we have in programming, which is always good.

1576
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:19,600
Right.

1577
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,700
More options of how to solve problems is always a good thing because

1578
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,400
each one of them probably makes different trade-offs and then people

1579
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,900
will be able to pick from different solutions based on the trade-offs.

1580
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,100
But the question of how you learn to do that,

1581
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,900
You know, without being biased.

1582
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,400
Because you know, I showed a solution or you read someone else's

1583
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,600
solution online and go.

1584
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,600
Okay, I should do that.

1585
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,500
It's tough, right?

1586
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:50,100
I try to show as much as possible, how I work through things and

1587
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,500
I don't know really what to say Beyond, that's how I do it.

1588
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:56,900
Right?

1589
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,400
Is I look at problems, like oh what are the what are the things I want

1590
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,300
to get out of this?

1591
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,000
What are the benefits?

1592
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,700
What are the drawbacks, what's wrong?

1593
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:08,900
You know, one way of asked say setting it up, is, what's wrong with my

1594
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,800
Approach with this current approach, right?

1595
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,100
Like look at how I did the platform layer and instead of thinking

1596
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:20,000
about it as a solution think of just okay, what is wrong with this?

1597
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,100
What don't I like

1598
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,500
About this architecture.

1599
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:26,700
What are the things that I think are causing problems are what?

1600
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:32,000
You know is you can't come up with anything then maybe it's a bad

1601
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,200
thing to even be spending your time on, right?

1602
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,800
I mean maybe it's just fine but if you can come up with things then I

1603
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,600
would say you know that's obviously the first step come up with some

1604
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,700
problems you think it has once you have those problems, then you can

1605
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:50,800
start focusing on what our design changes that would alleviate these

1606
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:51,100
problems.

1607
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,700
Problems.

1608
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,400
How would I code something that didn't have these problems and push

1609
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,200
towards that?

1610
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,800
That seems like a pretty sane way.

1611
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,600
To go about it.

1612
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,500
If you can't come up with problems for an approach that I presented,

1613
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:14,700
I think, then you're going to be in tough shape in terms of guiding

1614
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,500
your approach towards making a different solution, because it's hard

1615
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,000
to make a different solution without having a goal, right?

1616
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,200
You need a goal.

1617
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,400
You need to say, here's some stuff.

1618
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,400
Casey solution didn't do or things that I didn't like about it,

1619
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:37,700
because that's what kind of gives you the, the metric, the goal to

1620
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,800
sort of start iterating towards it gives you something to work.

1621
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,900
And you kind of need that it's hard to come up with a different

1622
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:47,200
solution, strictly by measuring it against whether it's not my

1623
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,700
solution, right?

1624
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Or someone else is solution because that just is an aimless Wanderer

1625
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,200
and you're liable to not really get anywhere, interesting.

1626
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,100
If all you want to do is be different.

1627
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,900
So I think what you want to do

1628
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:07,700
Is pick different goals and then achieve those goals and see how

1629
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,000
achieving those goals changes, the solution.

1630
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,100
That would probably be my recommendation.

1631
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,100
She is me.

1632
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:21,600
All right, my voice is is going, so we should probably end things

1633
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,200
shortly.

1634
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,400
But yet.

1635
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,000
Let me see if there's anything else on here.

1636
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,300
How long do you think a good game should be?

1637
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,100
I'd say 20 hours is minimal.

1638
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,600
Well, I guess what I would say is that's a game design question.

1639
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,300
That's game design question and I'm not really qualified to answer it.

1640
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:03,500
But what I would say is I think as a player I would probably object to

1641
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,800
the question because I don't think game should be about length.

1642
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,900
I think they should be about the experience.

1643
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,700
And I think a game should be as long as the experience warrants.

1644
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,700
I don't think a 20 hour minimum as a definition for a Dame is good

1645
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:23,300
because I don't think quantity has anything.

1646
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,200
To do with quality in certain circumstances.

1647
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,400
It is about quantity.

1648
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,800
I think Binding of Isaac is good because I play it.

1649
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,200
You can play it for 20, 40, 80 hours, whatever, and it evolves with

1650
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,500
you.

1651
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:39,100
And in some sense, that's sort of where I would like to see this game,

1652
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,500
go as well.

1653
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,000
I'd like to see this game, be a game that's about many play throughs,

1654
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,700
so yeah, 20 hours of handmade hero play, makes sense to me, because

1655
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,400
it's about that kind of thing.

1656
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,100
But at the same time, you know, if you're talking about an interactive

1657
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,000
story, kind of

1658
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:59,100
variance, or if you're talking about, you know, a game that's not

1659
01:29:59,100 --> 01:29:59,800
about

1660
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,000
Learning Jamie systems like that.

1661
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,700
And seeing how they evolve, then, 20 hours.

1662
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,800
Why do I want to take 20 hours?

1663
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,800
You know, why do, why do I want length?

1664
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:18,100
As a thing when I go to a movie, I don't want the movie to be 20 hours

1665
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,500
long.

1666
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,500
I want it to be a nice good story told in two hours, right?

1667
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,400
Maybe three.

1668
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,500
And so I feel like

1669
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:32,600
When you're trying to do other things with a game than expose deep

1670
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,700
Dungeons and Dragons, like interaction systems or something.

1671
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:41,900
I think that those games don't necessarily want to be super long, you

1672
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:46,600
know, if you're playing The Walking Dead or whatever or whatever those

1673
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:49,700
games like a Telltale Game or something like that, I don't think I

1674
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:54,400
want that to be, you know, 20 hours long I think I want that to be

1675
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,300
less than that.

1676
01:30:57,100 --> 01:31:02,100
You know, I would say that I don't I don't love the question.

1677
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:07,400
I think that it should more be about how long should an individual

1678
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:07,900
game be?

1679
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,700
That should be the question.

1680
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:13,600
Was this game the right length for the game design?

1681
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,800
Did this game design have 20 hours worth of good stuff or not?

1682
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,400
And a lot of times I feel like there are games that do take 20 hours

1683
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,300
like Final Fantasy is a great example of a game that takes

1684
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,500
XT H to play, even though there was only five hours of gameplay in it,

1685
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,700
right?

1686
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,700
Like I would say that you could condense Final Fantasy 10 down to five

1687
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,800
hours of awesome gameplay.

1688
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:44,300
Instead, they spread it out over 70 and that wasn't better, right?

1689
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,700
I don't think that was better because I play, you know, I did a lot of

1690
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,300
battles where I did exactly the same thing and as a player that's just

1691
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,100
not that interesting.

1692
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:57,000
I want to do that, I want to experience.

1693
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,700
The evolution of those battles and forcing me to play through 100 of

1694
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,200
the same battle to get to a point where now it's time to change up my

1695
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,600
strategy because I got new things and I'm finding new monsters.

1696
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,000
I don't I don't think that adds to a game.

1697
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,900
I think that's basically just wasting the players time, right?

1698
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,600
And so I feel like asking that question for every game is a good idea.

1699
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:26,000
Does this games game design actually benefit from this extension of

1700
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,400
gameplay or doesn't it?

1701
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:31,600
And let's make the game, the right size because some games should be

1702
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,300
20 hours.

1703
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,300
Some games should be two hours and some games should be somewhere in

1704
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,100
between some games, should be 80 hours, right?

1705
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,500
And I think that's the way to ask that question.

1706
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,300
All right, so let's let's go ahead and wrap things up.

1707
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,600
I think we've done a good bit of talking for today.

1708
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:57,900
So, thank you everyone for joining me for handmade hero.

1709
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,900
Kind of wrapping up the week.

1710
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,700
I think we

1711
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,100
Some good stuff today.

1712
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:02,200
So that kind of went out.

1713
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:05,300
We've got a bunch of stuff we can pick from Monday.

1714
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,300
We can open up that list.

1715
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:11,300
Pick something from the list and go to town and kind of start our next

1716
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:15,000
aspect of exploration, which I like I said, I think it's been going

1717
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:15,500
pretty well.

1718
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:18,300
I like the way things are shaping up in the game so far, we haven't

1719
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,200
had any real serious things that the called me to kind of go.

1720
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,700
Like, we haven't really addressed this thing.

1721
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,200
So we're kind of getting there.

1722
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,600
I'm happy about the way things are going.

1723
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:29,800
Yeah.

1724
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,900
Yeah, I'm pretty optimistic.

1725
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,700
So I like it.

1726
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,100
I like what we broke down on the list.

1727
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,200
I think all those things are useful things to do and I think they'll

1728
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:38,200
be fun to tackle and we'll see where it leads us.

1729
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,500
So as always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can

1730
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,500
always pre-order the game.

1731
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,600
It comes with the full source code right now, you can always download

1732
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,300
the source code.

1733
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,000
I upload it every time after we finish.

1734
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:51,600
So if you'd like to play around with it at home or if you just like to

1735
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,200
follow along with the code as we code on the stream, that's a good way

1736
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:54,500
to do it.

1737
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,600
You can pre-order it on handmade here at dot org.

1738
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,800
