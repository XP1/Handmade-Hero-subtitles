00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me for handmade hero.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,700
Welcome to the only show on Twitch where we coded complete game live

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,700
from scratch.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,300
No engine, no libraries, no nothing.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,600
We do it all here, it's like one of those weird fancy restaurants

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,500
where they like grow all the herbs in a garden on the roof, right?

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,100
You know, the kind I'm talking about and it's very strange and like

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,900
when you read the menu, you don't actually know what any of the things

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,600
are because the descriptions don't really

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,900
If anything, they're filled, both mostly with words that you've never

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,100
heard of before or that you have a vague sense of what they might be.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,600
But you really just aren't sure.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,300
And you kind of have to wait for the waiter to come over and when they

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,700
come over you have to be like.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,100
So the salmon and like you kind of let your voice Trail off like that

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,900
and that lets them know that you really have no idea what you were

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,700
looking at.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,100
That's sort of what we're doing here, you know?

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,500
I'll admit that but we do not have a garden on the roof.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,599
I've actually never been on the roof of this building.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,300
I suspect it's probably very dangerous.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,100
It's actually rather tall building but we do grow all of our code

23
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,700
ourselves.

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,000
And all of our pixels are hand selected by us for the finest quality

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
and that is something that we're going to get back into today.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,100
We have gotten to the point where we're doing our own texture mapping.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,100
We wrote our own texture, mapped renderer and

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,500
We have a bunch of things that we kind of need to look out into now in

29
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,300
terms of picking, what our next step is.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,100
So I think today is a good day for us to kind of, like, figure out

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,500
what it is.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,200
We want to accomplish with the rest of the renderer and make a plan

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,800
for getting there.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,300
So if you have pre-ordered, the game on handmade hero dot-org and you

35
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,500
would like to follow along with a source code at home today, it is day

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,200
96.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
So you want to unpack day 95 source code, because that is what I am

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,400
working with today.

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,100
And so if you want to

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,900
Line up with what I'm doing that is the code to start with all right?

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,800
So you know we we had a little bit of something that we needed to

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,100
address at the end of last episode and we kind of got to think about

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,800
how we want to do that.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Exactly.

45
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,300
I don't remember exactly which state we left it in here but I guess we

46
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
left it in the optimized Village.

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,800
So as you can see, even with are completely unoptimized renderer where

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,400
we were now doing gamma correction everywhere and we were also

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,100
supporting scaling and texture map.

50
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,100
And rotating and all that stuff and we got all that working things

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,300
were very slow when we compiled our build without optimizations on,

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,700
but they're plenty fast with optimizations on.

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,500
But as I was pointing out, it makes a little hard to do a teaching

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,400
stream if we compile with optimizations on because it makes stepping

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
through the code, be very jumping.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
It's hard for me to show you things.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
I want to show you when we do that.

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,200
So what I do want to do is figure out some way that we can start to

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,400
address that and really we've got two ways that we can do that and I

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,000
feel like

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,700
There's certainly some, they're certainly.

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,600
I agree.

63
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,200
There's there's a certain part of me that philosophically wants to

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,000
say, let's not optimize the code ourselves right now, because if we

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,200
start optimizing the code ourselves right now, we haven't really

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,800
necessarily gotten to the point where we know everything that we want

67
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,500
to do with it.

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,800
And so the optimization may have to be changed or may, you know, be

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,300
sort of rendered obsolete.

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,700
When later we decide we need to do other things with the renderer.

71
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,800
But another part of me says well I don't know how bad that really is.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
At the end of the day because we haven't introduced optimization

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
really at all on this stream.

74
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
We haven't talked about it at all, and so optimizing something and

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,200
then having to optimize it again.

76
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,600
Later is really not a big deal because maybe we kind of need to do

77
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,300
that just to let everyone have a chance to kind of see what goes on

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,500
there.

79
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,600
So I don't really know which way I should tackle that if I was doing

80
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,900
the code myself, I certainly wouldn't optimize it now but you know

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,500
that's you know, certain things happen differently on the stream here

82
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,700
just because it is a teaching stream.

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,500
So there's that.

84
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,300
So what I was kind of thinking we might do in terms of moving forward

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,700
on this, we've got to sort of directions we can go one is, we can add

86
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,300
some features to the renderer right now, meaning we can go, what are

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,600
some, what are some of the other features that we might need?

88
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,899
Can we get them in there?

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,500
And can we do that with letting the code be unoptimized?

90
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,899
We can step through it and all that.

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,300
And the features that I think that we don't have in there right now

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,100
that we might need really.

93
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,600
There's two.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
And one of them is not so much.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Teacher.

96
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,300
The first one is making sure that we have a sort of a rigorous

97
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,600
definition of what filling a pixel means and where the texture is come

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
from for those pixels, right?

99
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
Because we were kind of ad hoc with it.

100
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,200
When we just we're getting things working, which is a good idea

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,900
because you really don't want to be too hung up on any one thing where

102
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,700
you just trying to get something working, so that's fine.

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,600
But before we start building a bunch of stuff on top of this, it would

104
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
be nice to know that we had really dotted the eyes and

105
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,800
Cross the t's, in terms of where, you know, what is our pixel fill

106
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,900
rule, how does it?

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,000
And how does it operate?

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What is our rule for Gathering texels?

109
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,100
And all that sort of stuff.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
So that would be nice.

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,700
The other thing that we haven't tackled because we have tinting and we

112
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,200
have Alpha control and we have scaling, we have rotation, which is

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,100
most of, I think what we probably will use for the game, but one thing

114
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,600
that we do not have is we do not have any sort.

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,700
Of lighting control in here.

116
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,800
Meaning that if you wanted to change the pixels of a Sprite in here,

117
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,100
in some way that had to do with a directional or area based light

118
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,400
source, we don't really have any way of doing that effectively.

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,700
So the other thing that I thought that we probably would want to

120
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
investigate before.

121
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,700
We start optimizing our actual texture filling routines, is to take a

122
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,400
look and say what can we do?

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
You know, we've got our little tests right here, that's rotating

124
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,900
Around, and it's nice.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,900
Move and does all the things we wanted it to do.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
What can we add here?

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,400
That would allow us to do some more Dynamic Lighting on this thing,

128
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,100
right to sort of give it a little more of that liveliness and so that

129
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,300
we allow our game to kind of be a little bit more fancy.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,900
So you know I'm differing about it and to be honest, I don't really

131
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,700
know which one we should do.

132
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,100
But here's what I'm going to say I think that if I just turn off

133
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,800
everything else.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,600
The game and just where to render just the tree.

135
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,000
Obviously, we would not have a lot of performance problems anymore, I

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,700
don't think right because having completely unoptimized code, if we're

137
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,200
only running it on a very small subsection, that doesn't seem like it

138
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,100
would be a problem.

139
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,200
So maybe what we should do, is turn all this stuff off just stop

140
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,100
rendering entirely which is Trivial for us to do only render one or

141
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,300
two things put in our lighting, get that working.

142
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,200
Get our

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,900
So sort of math.

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,400
Correct?

145
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Like exactly the way we're going to do that.

146
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,900
And then button that down, say that's the renderer.

147
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
That's the features that it supports.

148
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,800
And now let's go ahead and optimize it seems like a pretty same path

149
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,100
to me.

150
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,700
It's very similar to the path that I would take if I was doing this

151
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,100
for real.

152
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,400
So that feels kind of good.

153
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,400
And so that's sort of what I'm thinking we might do.

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
So, let's just take a look at that.

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's see what that would entail.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,100
As a start to today.

157
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,800
So, if I open up the code here, right?

158
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,500
You remember that we have our render or kind of builds up groups of

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,100
things that it's going to render and then it issues them after the

160
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,300
fact.

161
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,100
So we kind of have this push buffer scheme.

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,100
It builds up a list of things that wants to do and then it renders

163
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,200
them.

164
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,700
Now, our test thing that we were working on with rotation and scaling

165
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,100
that we got working was in this render enter entry coordinate system

166
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,200
thing which is really just a test thing that allows a specified

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,300
coordinates and then it would kind of work or rectangle so that we

168
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,600
could learn

169
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Do that and that all went very well but what we can do is recognize

170
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,000
the fact that right now, all of our fancy code is running through this

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
path, right.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,700
And so the other code, which you modified it be gamma correct and

173
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,900
which is kind of slow now.

174
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,000
But that doesn't do any of the fanciness in terms of the stretching

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,700
and rotating.

176
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,400
And that sort of stuff is going through these other code paths, right?

177
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,400
So this drawbitmap code path, for example, if I were to just get rid

178
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,500
of it, right?

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,700
So we just we just fully get rid of it.

180
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Oops, that's that's a good type out and V.

181
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,799
Like so so if I just got rid of it entirely, then when we ran the the

182
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,700
program we would end up with just the tree on our hideous, pink

183
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,000
background, right?

184
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
And of course, if I left in the outline rectangle stuff so we're still

185
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,200
seeing those.

186
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,600
But we have our hideous, pink background and we have our little guy

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,500
and of course, we can make our hideous pink background, not such

188
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,200
hideous, pink for the moment, certainly we can go in and change that.

189
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,500
So

190
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,500
I've got our.

191
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,100
Let's see.

192
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,000
Where was that guy?

193
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,100
There's are clear.

194
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,200
And that's the ground chunks.

195
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,100
So here we have our clear right here, so if we wanted to clear the

196
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,200
screen to black or to gray or something, in fact, I guess maybe I'll

197
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,100
pick a gray here.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,800
Like so if you wanted to clear to a gray, we could do that.

199
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,000
And then we have a pretty open, you know, ability here to kind of to

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,300
kind of play with this and if I go ahead and take out the optimization

201
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,600
request to the compiler.

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
So we go from having that owed.

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,500
D2 that 02 to have them that OD cure is the slow version running and

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
that again is totally fine speed-wise, I think, right?

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,600
So I feel like, for the most part, right for the most part, this is

206
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,800
probably good for us and we can just work on this for a couple days,

207
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,500
get in the new features that we want.

208
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,500
And then switch over to optimization at a time when it's probably a

209
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,200
little bit better.

210
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,800
So unless anyone has some

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Reservations about that.

212
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,800
I think that's what we're going to do.

213
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,900
So.

214
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,500
All right, let's start with first of all, we don't really need this

215
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,700
guy to be rotating anymore for the moment.

216
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,100
We can stop with all of the rotation.

217
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,600
So I'm going to go ahead and here and just have that rotation stopped

218
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,300
entirely.

219
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,100
So there we go and and now our tree is they're just kind of sitting

220
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,100
sitting upright.

221
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
So, what I want to do is kind of introduce what the

222
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,700
Of lighting here are we won't go to into detail about some things but

223
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,800
then we'll kind of start to try and figure out what it is that we want

224
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,900
to implement in terms of lighting, okay?

225
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,100
Here we go.

226
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Where is the Blackboard?

227
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
There is the Blackboard.

228
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, so here we are on day, 96.

229
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,500
And we want to talk about lighting because Lighting in fact, I'll

230
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,800
quote Doug church here.

231
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,400
One of the primary, you might even say the primary person who made

232
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Ultima underworld lighting.

233
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,600
Is the sound?

234
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,500
Of graphics.

235
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,100
And that is Doug Church.

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
The doctor is very smart and you should listen to him but I can

237
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,600
understand why taken out of context.

238
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,900
This quote, might seem a little strange.

239
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,200
What he was trying to say at the time and it is now absolutely classic

240
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,100
quote, in my opinion, what he was saying at the time, it was actually

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,600
John Carmack.

242
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,500
Had given a private demo of Quake before anyone had seen it in the

243
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,100
public.

244
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,400
And one of the big things that he had added, since the last time the

245
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,100
people in this sort of private demo had seen it was, he had added

246
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,500
The shadow Maps, right?

247
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,700
And the shadow Maps, really dramatically.

248
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,800
Change the look of a game.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Because when you look at something with no lighting, it just kind of

250
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
looks like this flat, but, you know, arrangement of colors on the

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,700
screen, it just doesn't have any sense of place or any sense of depth

252
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:11,900
to it.

253
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,000
And when you put in that sort of realistic shadowing or even not that

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
realistic shadowing at some level.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,500
Just some degree of allowing your eye to kind of see that, that, that

256
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
sort of way in which the light plays off the space.

257
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,900
It really you know, changes dramatically

258
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,400
How present that spaces and how much that space feels alive and feels

259
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:35,900
real?

260
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,400
And it gives it a lot of dimensionality there because a lot of depth,

261
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,000
right?

262
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,900
And so, what he was saying with this quote was, he was referring to

263
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,200
the kind of alt well-known sort of similar sort of thing to this,

264
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,700
which is that if you play a game without sound, you'll be shocking at

265
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,500
how much worse.

266
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,700
It feels, even though you're not really consciously aware of it.

267
00:12:59,700 --> 00:12:59,900
This

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,500
Sound.

269
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,300
Add so much to the look that, you know, you feel like a game just

270
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,500
doesn't look as good, right?

271
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,000
If there's no sound with it or if the sound isn't good and if the

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
sound is great, it makes the game look better in this weird way

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,300
because all of the actions are accentuated with these sound effects

274
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,100
and it really sort of brings it to life.

275
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,200
And so what he was saying with lighting is the sound of Graphics, he

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,900
was sort of likening lighting to sound in that way, which is,

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,400
Like you can do all this great modeling and you can have these great

278
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,300
art assets but if you don't like them, well you lose this.

279
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,500
This very important accentuation that really makes things come alive

280
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,800
and so it's true in a 2-D game.

281
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
It's not as big of a deal in the 3D as it is in a 3D game because the

282
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,900
artists do a lot of baking of the lighting into, you know, the the

283
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Sprites that they do but we still would like to have Dynamic Lighting

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,800
in the game because there's a

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,400
A lot of accentuation that Dynamic lighting can do just to give some

286
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,600
simple examples of why we might care about Dynamic lighting.

287
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,300
We might, for example, want to have, you know, with, given our tree

288
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,500
example, you know, if we've got a bunch of trees in the world and

289
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,700
they're around, you know, a little campfire kind of thing that's

290
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
happening here, right?

291
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,300
We might want to have that campfire flicker against the trees.

292
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,000
That's just a really it sets that scene really nicely, that sort of

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,400
thing.

294
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,500
Similarly, if someone is is, you know, if some kind of wizard here,

295
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,100
you know, with, with a long kind of beard or something like this and

296
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,500
who's very angry because of some reason that like j.r.r.

297
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,100
Tolkien took, 5,000 pages to explain and that maybe still doesn't make

298
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,600
a whole lot of sense but you know you can ask some parents about it

299
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,900
and they'll

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Explain to you all the backstory.

301
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,700
He casts some Fireball, right?

302
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,200
And so here is the fireball that's that's there and it's going

303
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
forwards and as that fireball move

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
By the trees for example right?

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
You want to kind of see that light playoff them and animated way.

306
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,100
First letting up here and here and then here and here, right?

307
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,000
You want to see that and that really accentuates the motion the thing.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,400
And again, it makes it feel like they're all in the same space

309
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,100
together.

310
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,100
You can also have the absence of light tell a story and similar way.

311
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,200
If you have you know the shadow of something that's very large, come

312
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,500
over space, that's all that sort of stuff is examples of how in 2D

313
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,600
games you still do want to have some control flooding if you can

314
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
If you can, if you can't help it, right?

315
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So what are the ways that we can get lighting into our game?

316
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,300
Let's talk about lighting in a sort of abstract sense and sort of then

317
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,200
we'll talk about how we can actually get our Sprites to have some of

318
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,200
that because again we don't have full fully 3D representations here

319
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,800
coming in.

320
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,800
So we don't have the complete information, we would need to do full

321
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,200
lighting.

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,100
Okay.

323
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,600
So, lighting is fundamentally.

324
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,500
A directional effect, right?

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,300
And what I mean by that is light is traveling in lines.

326
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,800
This is true in the real world for the most part, right?

327
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,900
When you think about light in the real world, we're talking about

328
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,500
photons that travel in straight lines.

329
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,100
I mean, modulo relativistic effects and all these other sorts of

330
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,300
things.

331
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,600
But traveling in straight lines, between two points bouncing off and

332
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,200
traveling in another straight line.

333
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,900
Eventually, you know these light these photons they all start at

334
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,600
I'm light source, right?

335
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
You know, I'm saying they all start at some light source and they

336
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,200
bounce off a bunch of surfaces in the world and they fundamentally

337
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
eventually come back to your eyeball, right?

338
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,700
That's your eyeball where you collect those photons and in the process

339
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,300
of collecting those photons, your eye constructs and image.

340
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,800
And what that means is, all of the effects that have to do with

341
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,900
lighting are very much about the direction

342
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,599
In which the light was coming from at any given time and what this

343
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,300
unfortunately kind of means when you extrapolate it out, far enough is

344
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,800
that doing lighting correctly is actually extremely difficult and I'll

345
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,599
try to give you a little bit of a picture of why.

346
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,300
Real lighting if you were to do it, completely correctly is

347
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,800
extraordinarily difficult.

348
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,600
So if you were to compute the lighting what actually happens with

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,900
lighting and let's take out everything from this equation, except the

350
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,400
Are Necessities.

351
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,100
Okay?

352
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,700
So all we're going to have is we're just going to have the sun here is

353
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,900
the sun, right?

354
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,300
This is the sun, we are going to have one surface.

355
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
That's it, right?

356
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
So the light comes down, it hits this surface, right?

357
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,900
And we're going to have just your I just just your eyeball.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,300
There it is, right?

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Light comes down it hits.

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
It it comes back in here and it hits your retina back here and

361
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,500
produces an image of your brain, right?

362
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,000
So let's suppose that that's what we've got.

363
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,800
So, even in just this situation where this is the only thing that's

364
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
happening, Computing, the lighting for this effect, no matter what

365
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,100
this surface is, is still incredibly difficult.

366
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,500
There are a few services that can make it easier.

367
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,000
But for the most part, it's incredibly difficult because the way that

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,300
light bounces off a surface is highly chaotic.

369
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Most surfaces that you see in the real world, actually scatter light

370
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:38,700
in

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,300
Need directions when it hits.

372
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,000
So when the Sun hits this surface, right?

373
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,000
It bounces in all directions.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Typically?

375
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,400
Right?

376
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,900
So photons come in you know billions of photons come in from the Sun.

377
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,400
They strike this surface and they bounce off in all directions.

378
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
Some of them bounce off in the direction of your eye and those are the

379
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,900
ones you see, others don't others, bounce off in other directions and

380
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,600
there they go, right?

381
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,300
Now when it bounces off a surface right?

382
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,100
The photons.

383
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
They actually have a wavelength.

384
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Okay, and so for those of you don't know anything about light, light

385
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
has wavelengths.

386
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,500
And wavelengths are essentially, you know, I am not a physicist.

387
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,900
So when I am leaving to say what wavelengths are, I'll say, what I

388
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,000
think of wavelengths are but I'm sure a physicist would correct,

389
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
whatever, I'm about to say.

390
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,900
But point being light, the photons that come in there is this whole

391
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,000
notion in physics of particle, wave Duality and all this stuff that I

392
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
don't even pretend to understand.

393
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,500
But basically what happens is you can think of the the light as

394
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,000
oscillating, you know, like a sine wave kind of thing.

395
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,300
It's

396
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,000
Lighting.

397
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,300
So, when it's coming down this line, it's actually oscillating and the

398
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:59,900
speed, which oscillates is actually changes, right in there is the

399
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,500
wave length, the distance between when it crosses the same point, it

400
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,800
changes depending on the light source.

401
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,900
So when the light is emitted, it has a certain wavelength.

402
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,800
And those wavelengths are the colors that we perceive, there's

403
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,700
infrared.

404
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,400
Which is colors.

405
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,600
We can't perceive down in the heat Spectrum, then it crosses into red,

406
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,400
right?

407
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,600
Goes through all of the colors in the Spectrum until it gets to

408
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,300
Violet.

409
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
And then ultraviolet, right?

410
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,400
Which we can't perceive.

411
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,500
So there's more wavelengths in both directions but we can't see them.

412
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,300
We might be able to feel them, or we might be able to see them once

413
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,200
they hit something and change back into visible light.

414
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,900
But for the most part we can't see anything on either of those two

415
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,500
sides.

416
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,200
Okay, but everywhere else in here, we actually see this light and the

417
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
way that we see this light and incidentally, this is why monitors if

418
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,800
you ever wonder why our monitors RGB, you know, what's the

419
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
With that, right?

420
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,300
Because honestly RGB isn't a thing in the real world, it's not a

421
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,400
thing, right?

422
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,800
We actually have continuous wave lengths of light that can represent

423
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,700
any color.

424
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
It's not a question of their being red light, green light and blue

425
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,500
light.

426
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,900
That's not, that's not a thing, right?

427
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,200
There's actually all of the colors are real and have their own unique

428
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
wavelength, right?

429
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,600
Well, the reason RGB is the thing that we use is because our I

430
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
actually only has receptors at those points, right?

431
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
So basically in your retina

432
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,700
Okay, in your retina, you have sensors for red, you have sensors for

433
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,300
green, and you have sensors for blue, okay.

434
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,300
And the way these sensors collect light is they collect it in, sort of

435
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,100
a, you know, an overlapped fashion, right?

436
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,900
Like this.

437
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,400
And so your green receptors.

438
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Don't only catch one specific, wavelength of light, they respond more

439
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
strongly or more negatively.

440
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,500
I was are more strongly or less strongly depending on how far the

441
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,600
wavelength from light is that hits them is from Green.

442
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,900
So by looking at the combined activity of your red green and blue

443
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,800
sensors, what your brain is effectively doing is trying to figure out

444
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
where the light

445
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Six were, you know, that actually hit.

446
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
So like something comes in here, right?

447
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,500
And it, you know, it's cyan or something, right?

448
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,200
And, you know, it sort of is, is or, you know, I don't know what color

449
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,400
it is.

450
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,900
I drew that line in a place that I'm not sure exactly what it is.

451
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,100
But it's registering on both the green and the blue, let's say, right?

452
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,200
And so, you know, it's there and there it's registering you'll

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,100
perceive that as a color that's that's, you know, a mix of green and

454
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:01,500
blue.

455
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,800
One of

456
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,200
Those colors that's in here, right?

457
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
And if you happen to have light that's coming in at multiple

458
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,100
wavelengths, right?

459
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,100
You've got you can have light coming in that Scott photons of all

460
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
sorts of different wavelengths.

461
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,200
That's you know you know maybe a light source is emitting lots of

462
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,100
different kinds of photons.

463
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Some like this, you can have things like white where there's some

464
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,300
coming in here and some coming in here and some coming in here and

465
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,300
whatever and it's it's affecting all of these sensors evenly etc, etc,

466
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,800
right?

467
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
So RGB tends to be a very effective way to represent colors because

468
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,300
that is basically just us saying, all right?

469
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,800
Just output light at the three things you can perceive and we'll just

470
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,800
fool your eye into thinking it seeing something like yellow.

471
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,000
For example, by highly triggering the red and the green light with red

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
Wilt by Heart, by putting out, red, and green light that triggers,

473
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,500
those two sensors and not putting out any blue.

474
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,000
So your eye goes oh that must be some yellow light coming in but

475
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,400
surprise wasn't yellow light.

476
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,000
It was red and green light in the real world.

477
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,800
There may be such a thing as yellow light.

478
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
You may actually be seeing yellow.

479
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,200
When you see yellow, not a combination of red and green but you'll

480
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,600
never know because you can't see it.

481
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,500
Now, there are other animals that have more sensors in here.

482
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,900
And in their world, they can tell the difference.

483
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,700
So, if they were to look at a monitor, they would be like, your

484
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
monitor is awful.

485
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,400
That doesn't look anything like the world looks.

486
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,100
You guys don't know anything about technology.

487
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
That's what they'd say.

488
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,600
And we would look at the picture and go.

489
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,300
What are you talking about?

490
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,800
Looks exactly, right, it's just like, you'd like you went out and took

491
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
a photograph, right?

492
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:29,800
So

493
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,900
Don't talk to those animals, okay?

494
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,200
That's if there's any lesson that you take away from a day.

495
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,100
It's don't talk.

496
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,300
Two animals.

497
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,900
With more color receptors.

498
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,200
Or more color, wavelength.

499
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,800
Sensors.

500
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,700
Venu.

501
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,300
Okay.

502
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,200
Because frankly, it's not worth the hassle.

503
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
So I think that's the main takeaway, but let's compress on and

504
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,300
continue, we've got about how much we got.

505
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,600
We've got 35 minutes so I'm going to press on, try to get to the

506
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,900
actual lighting even though this is really the main takeaway, okay?

507
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,300
So back to our picture.

508
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,900
So we have wavelengths of light, wavelengths of light are coming in,

509
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,700
they're hitting the surface, and they're scattering in all directions.

510
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,600
Some of which come to your eye.

511
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,400
Now the problem and the reason that I said, it's such a fantastically

512
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,300
difficult problem is because this is true for any incoming Direction.

513
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,200
Okay?

514
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,900
So if there was light coming, if you had a second son, for example,

515
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,400
and there was light coming from there, maybe it's the Dark Crystal, if

516
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,600
you got a

517
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,400
Concerned.

518
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,800
There's coming here it would also scatter light towards your eye.

519
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,500
Okay?

520
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,800
So what you see when you look at a surface is, you actually see the

521
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,000
aggregate effect of all of the light sources scattering light towards

522
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,400
your eye.

523
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,600
And the reason that this is a problem, even if you only have one son,

524
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,100
is because everything else in the world is also reflecting all of

525
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,500
those photons.

526
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,400
A lot of them are bouncing right back to that.

527
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Point that you saw and then scattering to your eye.

528
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,300
So in order to compute even the lighting the correct lighting at just

529
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:24,900
one point in the world, effectively requires Computing, what the

530
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:30,100
light, what the incoming light was for all of the directions emanating

531
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,000
from that point.

532
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,000
It is an incredibly, incredibly difficult problem.

533
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,600
It is why accurate lighting is probably the hardest thing to do in

534
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
computer Graphics.

535
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Now if that wasn't

536
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,900
Bad enough, it actually gets even worse.

537
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,200
For reals.

538
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,100
The light doesn't actually just bounce off the surface.

539
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,800
The light actually travels into the surface then back out.

540
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,700
Okay.

541
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,800
If we were to talk about a real

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,500
Fast.

543
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,700
It is actually has some thickness to it and let's say it could be

544
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,900
something very complicated like Wax.

545
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,600
And what happens is when photons hit the surface anywhere, not just,

546
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,200
the point you're measuring, but anywhere the light goes into the

547
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,700
surface and the photons actually pass through.

548
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,300
They maybe don't hit anything, but then they do hit something inside

549
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
the surface, right?

550
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:28,000
They bounce, they bounce again, then they hit the exit point and

551
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,700
happen to scatter back to your eye.

552
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Right.

553
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
This is called subsurface scattering.

554
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,600
So technically, if you really wanted to do light incorrectly, not only

555
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,400
do you have to know all of the light in all of the world that could

556
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,300
possibly come back to you, right?

557
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,500
You need to know all of this but you also need to know all of the

558
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,900
light that could have come at you from inside the object that you're

559
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,100
talking about now.

560
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,600
Fortunately, a lot of objects are so opaque that you just don't have

561
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,200
to care.

562
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,400
But if you really want to do it, right, and you want to support wax

563
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,500
and you want to support Waters and you want to support dr.

564
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,000
Pepper

565
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,300
Or a flashlight.

566
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,300
You got to handle all of this, right?

567
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,000
Now, what makes surfaces?

568
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,100
Look different.

569
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,800
It's good question, right?

570
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,600
Because you look around the world and all the surfaces.

571
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
They look different, they have different colors.

572
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,700
Okay?

573
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
They have different shininess.

574
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,100
We talk about, some are translucent transparent.

575
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,200
We've got all these sorts of things.

576
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
What makes surfaces look different right.

577
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And the answer is what they do to the photons during this process,

578
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,000
okay?

579
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,900
So there are a couple primary aspects that you want to think about.

580
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,600
When you're thinking about lighting, the first one is for any incoming

581
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,100
Direction, okay?

582
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,400
And we can start to talk about these directions, very specifically.

583
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,600
I'll do the 2D version here, and I'll draw the 3D version in a second,

584
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,200
but for any incoming Direction.

585
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,000
And any outgoing direction, right?

586
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,700
And so maybe I'll draw that a little bit differently.

587
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,000
Let me draw them this way, so that they're both kind of on the same

588
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
angle system due to that way, right?

589
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,400
So, here is one angle in here.

590
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Is another call that fee, will call that Theta.

591
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,600
So, for any two angles and one, I have we'll call this the angle of

592
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,300
incidence.

593
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,700
So this is the way the light is coming into the surface, right?

594
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,900
So here's the light source.

595
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,400
And then the angle that were viewing, right?

596
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,700
So here is our viewing angle.

597
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
The thing that we're actually trying to measure along so there's RI

598
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,800
for any two angles.

599
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,900
Every given surface in the world will have a different amount of light

600
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,500
that they tend to reflect back.

601
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,400
Right?

602
00:29:59,700 --> 00:29:59,900
And

603
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
So if light is coming in at this angle Theta, right?

604
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,400
If it comes in at Theta, right?

605
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,800
We know that it goes out at fee for some percentage, okay?

606
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Some percentage of the photons will go out and for every surface in

607
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
the world that percentage will be different.

608
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,800
And that is what controls the shape of this lighting.

609
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,200
If you imagine, now, we need to Define it for every one of these and

610
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,400
every one of these combined.

611
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,900
So it's effectively a function of both Theta and fee, right?

612
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,800
It's a 2 dimensional function, saying for every angle that I've you

613
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,600
and for all of those angles every angle of incidence, there's a

614
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,000
different percentage of light that I'm going to reflect in that

615
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
direction, okay?

616
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,800
And obviously, this percentage should all some up to the total amount

617
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,200
of light.

618
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,100
So it's they should also add up

619
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,100
Hundred percent.

620
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,900
So all of the light that comes in, you know, should go out.

621
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Well, I shouldn't say that should sum up to that or less because it's

622
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,900
going to absorb some amount of light as well, right?

623
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,100
So, it's not gossip to understand, it's going to be less than that.

624
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,400
It can't emit more light than it takes in unless it's photo active.

625
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,500
In some way, which I suppose you could also simulate, right?

626
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,300
So this is what controls the look of that surface.

627
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,600
And if we extend it to the full range so that you could actually talk

628
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,100
about in here as well, then you're talking about

629
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,500
Doing what it looks like interior but you need a few more things, such

630
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,200
as How Stuff, scatters internally.

631
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,900
So you need a few more parameters to talk about how light bounces

632
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,800
around in here as well.

633
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:33,600
But this measured along say r g and B is what defines all the

634
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,000
services?

635
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,800
Although if you really again wanted to be absolutely precise about it.

636
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,900
You would actually have to say, well also the wavelength because

637
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,100
technically different surfaces can handle different.

638
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Wavelengths differently.

639
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,300
They don't have to obey our break down into RGB that we use an

640
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,600
approximation, right?

641
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,200
So you know, people will often use things like spectral calculus and

642
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,600
stuff like this if they're really trying to do accurate rendering to

643
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,600
handle things where different wavelengths of light behave differently

644
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,300
when they hit, right?

645
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,200
So this is an incredible, incredibly difficult problem.

646
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,600
And again I just want to kind of impress upon you how difficult

647
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,100
lighting is if you wanted to do it correctly and to set the stage for

648
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,200
saying we will not

649
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Not attempt anything like this because first of all you don't usually

650
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,900
do anything like this.

651
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,300
In real-time you often are going to use some approximation, but we

652
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,600
will be using much, much more simplified models of how the lighting

653
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Works in order to be able to achieve results in real time.

654
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,300
Okay.

655
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,100
so,

656
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,100
What sorts of surfaces do we tend to actually want, right?

657
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,300
Because that was all of them.

658
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,800
Let's talk about ones that we want.

659
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:56,300
So typically what we want to have in our the ability to simulate most

660
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,000
of the time, right?

661
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,400
If we're just talking about simple artistic concerns here,

662
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,500
What we typically want to have is diffuse surfaces you know, I guess I

663
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,600
would say glossy surfaces and reflecting it surfaces you know and

664
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,700
these are just my terms here.

665
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,100
I'm not trying to introduce any standard nomenclature be saying.

666
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,400
These are some ways you might think about them.

667
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,200
And what those are, is this, a diffuse surface is something like

668
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,600
chalk, right?

669
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,600
It's something that really doesn't have a bright highlight on it,

670
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,400
okay?

671
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,400
When light comes in it, scatters in all directions evenly.

672
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,700
It's not biased.

673
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So no matter where the reflection comes in, it's going to scatter in

674
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,600
all directions evenly, it just distributes it diffusely, right?

675
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,000
Glossy surfaces.

676
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,000
Well, let me do reflective surfaces first.

677
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So, highly reflective, I'll call these highly reflective surfaces are

678
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
like mirrors, right?

679
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,800
These are like mirror surfaces and what they do is when the light

680
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,300
comes in, they reflect it directly back out again, it doesn't scatter.

681
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,800
Nothing.

682
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,300
Goes in this direction.

683
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,500
Nothing goes that way.

684
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,000
Nothing goes It goes right out the opposite direction, right?

685
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,400
And that produces a mirror.

686
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,600
If you think about why that is, it's actually kind of obvious, all of

687
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,800
the time that you look at it.

688
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,600
It just basically is as if there wasn't your, I sitting there looking

689
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,800
back at

690
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,699
Other direction, right?

691
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,300
It's very very straightforward how that how that happens, right?

692
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:25,900
So that's, you know, ends up being sort of a mirror surface and the

693
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,900
glossy surface is somewhere in between it's one where light comes in

694
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,900
and most of it, right?

695
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,500
A high amount of, it goes out this way, but a little bit, goes out in

696
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,100
the other directions, right?

697
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
And typically, so there's sort of a lobe here.

698
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,699
You might say, right?

699
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So the reflectance, you know, is kind of less over here but then it

700
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,600
kind of gets

701
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,900
bigger in this direction and kind of goes like that, right?

702
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,500
So these are the kinds of surface that is that we tend to care about

703
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,500
because they are the ones that we could use artistically to get a

704
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,600
reasonable set of, you know, approximated effects in our games that

705
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
allow the services to look a little more realistic.

706
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,300
Okay.

707
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,600
so,

708
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,000
Given this, what we typically end up with, right?

709
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,800
Is we end up with

710
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,800
Approximations for those things.

711
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,300
That's the worst.

712
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:28,500
You know?

713
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm going to write that again.

714
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,300
That was the worst.

715
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,000
There we go.

716
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,600
There are some awful handwriting.

717
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,800
So what we tend to do is we try to come up with approximations that

718
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
will let us do reasonable jobs of these things, okay?

719
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,200
And originally back in the old days when lighting was really, really

720
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,400
bad because computers were too slow to do anything.

721
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
Good, typically what you had is you have literally computation

722
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,700
companies that look almost exactly like the diagrams that I was

723
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,200
drawing only, they didn't even really have any

724
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,700
Of any, of much of this stuff.

725
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,900
They were like, basically,

726
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,200
The, you know, I have a point that is sending light at my Surface,

727
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:04,900
right?

728
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,300
And then I have a bounced out to the thing and all I'm going to do is

729
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,600
have some fall off that determines, you know, how sharp the low bits

730
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:13,700
here.

731
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,200
That's that's all I'm going to do.

732
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,200
So light always comes in from just one place, right?

733
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,500
The source of light is one point and what that ends up looking like,

734
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,500
is it looks like somebody shining a flashlight.

735
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,800
Basically on surfaces, right?

736
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Right, and yes you can by controlling, you know, by looking at this

737
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,200
angle, the difference between the incoming and the outgoing, right?

738
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,800
I can make the services look more or less shiny by sort of controlling

739
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,200
whether or not the light that gets bounced bounced back falls off

740
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,300
sharply As you move away from that primary reflection angle, right.

741
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,300
So if the primary reflection is here and you know we're viewing it up

742
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:53,900
here.

743
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,000
If it's getting darker due to that then you know the surface will kind

744
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,900
of has a nice shininess as I move here, it gets brighter.

745
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
And so on and you can think about this surface, right?

746
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,400
Like, let's say that I was looking at a sphere, right?

747
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,000
We're evaluating this whole thing at every point on the sphere.

748
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,500
So basically, you know, if you want sort of a nice bright highlight

749
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,700
there and then, you know, it's dark everywhere.

750
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,300
Else we can do that sort of thing, that's not that big of deal, right?

751
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,000
But it always looks like just one light shining on a thing and it's

752
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,700
usually very harsh, right?

753
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,700
Usually has a harsh, a fairly harsh Shadow because there's no light

754
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
coming from anywhere else.

755
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
It's black on the back here unless you add in some fake light,

756
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,100
Right.

757
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,600
And all that sort of stuff, right?

758
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,800
So old approximations tends to be that way and they were pretty harsh.

759
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,100
Now we could of course live with stuff like that and what we're doing

760
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,700
because we already have art that's drawn that imagines that there's

761
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,500
all of this light coming in, right?

762
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,100
And so if we were to just overlay some lighting like this on top of

763
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,300
it, that would probably be, okay?

764
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,600
Right, it would basically just add in highlighting here and we let the

765
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,600
fact that the artist drew it, with some ambient lighting, take care of

766
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
the rest of it, right?

767
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,500
So you know, this would probably work for us, right?

768
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Because we're not in 3D and we're not having to recreate the entire

769
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,000
scene with all of its lighting ourselves.

770
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,800
We do have some leeway of picking old-school, fairly broken and lousy

771
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,700
approximations to lighting because what we need the lighting to do is

772
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,400
very limited.

773
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
We don't need it to recreate the entire look of the lighting.

774
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,400
The artists already did a lot of that, right?

775
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,900
But we may be able to do something better and we'll play around with

776
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,700
it because modern approximations will often do things that involve

777
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,000
say, light probing, right?

778
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:47,200
So light probes are ways of trying to get around this problem of only

779
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,900
having the compute computational power to deal with single points that

780
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,600
say, where the light is coming from.

781
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,500
Because remember, what I was saying back here, when I first introduced

782
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,800
this, the light comes from everywhere, right?

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
The light comes in from everywhere.

784
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,900
And so when you compute things, as if there's just one or two point,

785
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,000
light sources, it's never going to look like the real world because

786
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,900
you're never in a situation, where light is only coming from two light

787
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,100
sources.

788
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,800
Because even in a room, that only has one physical light, and even if

789
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,900
that light was almost a single point, like was a really tiny Point

790
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,200
light, the light bounces all over.

791
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,500
And once it's bouncing, it's coming in from everywhere.

792
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,600
So, every surface is still getting light from

793
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,500
Even if there's only one actual thing that we would call light.

794
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,600
And so what we've done nowadays in games to try and get around that in

795
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,700
a lot of cases is we try to come up with some way of allowing

796
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,800
approximations to all of that incoming light.

797
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,300
Now, that would be incredibly difficult for us to do if we were trying

798
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,000
to solve a directly, you end up with doing things like, you know that

799
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,900
Racers do where you kind of try to do this stochastic sampling and

800
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,100
reconstruct the light field.

801
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,900
There actually are some

802
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,500
The things you can go look at, there's a thing called Brigade.

803
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,100
It's a real-time Ray tracing renderer that they've gotten fairly far

804
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,300
on.

805
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
It's not the kind of thing.

806
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,600
You could really use in a real game yet but, you know, it's getting

807
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:11,800
better.

808
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,500
So there are times when people just full-on say, all right, you know,

809
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,900
let's try to simulate the whole thing and maybe someday when computing

810
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,200
power gets gets, you know that advanced you'll actually use that in a

811
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,100
game but not today we're still a ways off.

812
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,900
If it ever does come to pass, it's going to still be a few years away.

813
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:36,100
but what we can do is use things called light probes and what light

814
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,900
probes are or, you know, you could you could even I'd say this more

815
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,300
more sort of generally say, indirect light sampling, you know,

816
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,700
And basically, what we're doing here, what we're talking about is can

817
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,300
we build some systems which compute effectively like, look up Stables

818
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,800
or things that we can go quickly access that would give us a fast way

819
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,400
to compute all of the contributions of the light that is coming into a

820
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,700
surface, right?

821
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,200
And so oftentimes what you'll see people do is for example, let's

822
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,000
suppose that I want to light

823
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,100
You know, again, I've got that sphere, right?

824
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,300
And I want to light this fear.

825
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,000
So I want to compute the lighting at all of these pixels on the sphere

826
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,500
and so on and so forth, right?

827
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,900
Well what people will often do for example is they might render a cube

828
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,000
map which is essentially as if you were to start at the center of the

829
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,600
sphere and render out in all, you know, in six directions, right?

830
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:39,900
Six.

831
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,600
Orthogonal directions from the sphere render out images that you can

832
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
imagine if you were, you know.

833
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,300
Inside a cube like so.

834
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,500
If you're here, what you'll do is, you'll render out and actually

835
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,300
render what the world looks like on.

836
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,600
All of the faces of the cube right.

837
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,700
Does that make sense?

838
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
So essentially you made a box that

839
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,300
Is what the sphere kind of sees when it looks out from its current

840
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:03,900
direction.

841
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,400
Right?

842
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,200
Well, what that effectively is is, it's like a condensed, lookup table

843
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,300
of all of the light, right?

844
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,100
It's like a condensed way of saying, what all the light looked like

845
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,200
coming into the sphere and you're like, well, that's great Casey but

846
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,600
who cares?

847
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Because now I still don't know how to compute any of this stuff

848
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,100
because I was still have to go look at all of the pixels on these Cube

849
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,500
Maps.

850
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,600
Well yes and no.

851
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,900
What you then do is you might

852
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,500
Take this and you might start downsampling it.

853
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,300
So let's say you rendered these at 256 by 256 by 256.

854
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,000
Right?

855
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
Well it's really just doing it by 2 6 + 6 x, right?

856
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,900
So it's 256 by 256 by 61 for each face, right?

857
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,400
Suppose, I then blur these down to 128 by 128 by six, right?

858
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,900
And all the way down to 1 by 1 by 6.

859
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,800
Now, I would have a bunch of Cubes that are blurrier.

860
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,800
And blurrier versions of the light that's coming from around the room.

861
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
What good does that do me?

862
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,700
Well, it means I can now simulate the effect of all the incoming

863
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,000
light, right?

864
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,900
Like in this diagram by saying?

865
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,200
Well okay, if I know that my Surface is like that chalky surface and

866
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,700
all the light bounces evenly, then I'll just look at that most blurry

867
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,100
Cube because that's what it's going to look like, whatever.

868
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,900
The average light that comes in, that's a pretty reasonable

869
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,900
approximation, right?

870
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,800
If instead,

871
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,400
Said, I've got the other kind of service I should be using my other

872
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,200
diagram for this.

873
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,900
So if I've got that, I can just look at the blurry versions of the

874
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,700
cube and that tells me roughly what the aggregate light that comes in.

875
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,800
Looks like, if instead I've got points that have sort of a, you know,

876
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,600
a more pronounced reflection lobe there.

877
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,100
What I can do is sample this direction, out of one of the Heidi higher

878
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:57,900
detail, cubes and add it to a weighted version of the lower detail

879
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,800
Cube sample.

880
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,900
A nice averaged glossiness between the two, right?

881
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,200
So you get some reflection, you get some incoming ambient, right?

882
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,400
And furthermore, if I'm just doing highly reflective, I just sample

883
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,000
the the highest resolution Cube always and don't add in any of it,

884
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,500
right?

885
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,500
So there's ways that you can start to approximate these things, right?

886
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,600
And that's in 3D

887
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,900
So what do we do in 2D, right?

888
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,700
What are we going to do?

889
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,500
So we have two real problems in 2D, right.

890
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,000
Problem one, we don't know.

891
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,900
What the surfaces are.

892
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,300
In 3D, you always know what your surfaces are because they're

893
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,200
polygonal used.

894
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,600
So, you know what they shaped like.

895
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
You know what direction?

896
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
They're facing, you know.

897
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,400
The thing that you need to know, okay, but we have no idea in 2D

898
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,100
rendering what our services even our if we look at this tree all we've

899
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,100
got is colors, right?

900
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,600
And the reason that you and I see this as an actual 3D shape that we

901
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,300
recognize as a cartoony, little cute version of a tree is because our

902
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,800
brain is interpreting those colors and the value change, sort of the

903
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,400
brightness change of the greens,

904
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:33,700
To imply that there is sort of a tree shape there, right?

905
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,800
So we could go in as humans and kind of roughly know where each of

906
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,100
these cert what, you know, kind of made up these services.

907
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,100
But that's incredibly difficult for a computer to figure out, because

908
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,700
it doesn't even know this is supposed to be a tree.

909
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,500
Those are like machine.

910
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,200
Learning problems are incredibly difficult.

911
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,800
And so, the first question is, what can we do to even know what

912
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,800
direction or facing any of these services are?

913
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,400
Because remember, all of this stuff was based on reflection, right?

914
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,000
It was based on knowing the direction, the surface was pointing if the

915
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,300
surface is pointing that way it's going to reflect things a lot

916
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,400
different than if it's pointing this way.

917
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,300
Just like you throw a ball against a wall, it matters which way the

918
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,500
walls facing depending on, you know, how the ball is going to bounce,

919
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,200
right?

920
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,400
And so all of those reflectance functions are in terms of the

921
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,900
direction service.

922
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,300
We don't know what direction these services are pointing.

923
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,400
We have no idea, right?

924
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,400
So that's our first problem, and one solution to this is to have

925
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,000
normal maps for your Sprites, right?

926
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,000
And what a normal map is is that saying okay I've got a color map for

927
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,300
this, right?

928
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,400
This is what the colors are.

929
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,800
And then what I do is I augment that with a bitmap that basically has

930
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,100
at each location instead of storing RGB.

931
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:47,500
What it stores is XYZ of a vector that points in the direction that

932
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,400
the surface is pointing at that time, right?

933
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,300
So it's like a bunch of little tiny vectors that just say for every

934
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,600
pixel what direction that pixel surface was pointing.

935
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,600
Now, typically you don't actually need to store the x y z because it's

936
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,100
a normal.

937
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,200
So it has a length of 1.

938
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,900
So really only need to store the X and the y, or the Y and the Z, or

939
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,800
whatever, depending on what coordinate system, you want to use your

940
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,700
new star, two of these.

941
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,000
You can reconstruct the other one, but that's a totally separate

942
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,900
topic, right?

943
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,700
Point being a store of vectors in here.

944
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,500
So that works quite well for solving this problem.

945
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,400
The problem with that, where do you get them?

946
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,900
The artist painted the bitmap, they can't paint a normal map.

947
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,000
You can ask them to

948
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,900
Like a bump map and generate a normal map from it but then it takes

949
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,500
your artists a lot more time, blah, blah, blah.

950
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,900
There are programs that try to generate normal maps for you, who knows

951
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,100
if they'll work particularly well?

952
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,100
I could certainly try.

953
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,000
Passing ours through there.

954
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,400
We don't know, right?

955
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,900
So this is kind of a problem for us, but it's an art asset problem.

956
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,800
Not a computational problem because we can implement this and we

957
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,300
should so we'll go ahead and Implement normal maps, and then hope that

958
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,500
we'll have a way to produce some relatively useful, normal Master, our

959
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:58,900
stuff.

960
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,800
If we don't

961
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Then what, you know, what can we do?

962
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,500
At least we tried, right?

963
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,700
So we'll Implement that, as a solution for the 2D problem of not

964
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,800
knowing where the surfaces are.

965
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,300
And then if we can't get our assets to have reasonable Maps, maybe

966
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,000
we'll do something that fix them in a really bad way and just leave it

967
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
that way, I don't know, but point being will have the computational

968
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
stuff in there to handle them.

969
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,800
So that's problem one.

970
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
We also have problem, too.

971
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,700
Problem two is we don't know what the light field is.

972
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,400
In 3D.

973
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:42,900
We have the luxury of being able to do this because the whole idea

974
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,800
behind 3D games is that they're rendered in 3D, which means you can

975
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,500
set the Viewpoint anywhere you want and render in any direction you

976
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,000
want.

977
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,400
So if you want to know what the light field is at any particular

978
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,800
location or family of locations, you can usually come up with a way of

979
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,600
placing the camera and rendering so that you can see what it looks

980
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,700
like there and then you could use that for sampling, but we can't do

981
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,200
that.

982
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,000
So we have no way of placing a camera in this scene and rendering

983
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:07,700
things in.

984
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,700
Instructions to see what the lighting is.

985
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,600
So we needed to come up with something that will allow us to produce a

986
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,500
light field we can sample.

987
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,900
Now one way we can do this is just by using Point lights, right?

988
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,100
This was the old scheme that I was talking about before where we just

989
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,300
full-on just saved.

990
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,700
There's light coming from point somewhere and then that's just used in

991
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,600
computations, right?

992
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,500
We can do that.

993
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,400
Okay.

994
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,300
And you know if worst comes to worst, this is all we will do.

995
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,100
Will just put in point lights and we'll let the point light shine onto

996
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,500
the surfaces, right?

997
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,600
But we may be able to do something better by like doing some kind of

998
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,400
light rendering, right?

999
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:56,200
So what you could imagine us doing is you could imagine us making a

1000
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,400
thing that sits over the screen, a bitmap that we're going to render

1001
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,500
before we render a pre-render pass, right?

1002
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,300
And maybe that pretty render pass, you know, it's not 1920 by 1080,

1003
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,200
maybe it's 192, you know, maybe it's maybe it's subsampled by 10x.

1004
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,900
So instead of 1920 by 1080 right no it's not going to be that.

1005
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,400
It'll be like 192 you know, by 108 or something or maybe the closest

1006
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,100
power of 22 that.

1007
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,500
So maybe it'll be 128, you know, 256 by 128 or something like that.

1008
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,800
So we've got basically a map not a mat.

1009
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,100
That's a, that's a real thing.

1010
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,100
So a a, a sort of a

1011
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,500
separate frame buffer, if you will a light buffer that sits on top,

1012
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,800
when we start and we render our lights, we figure out a way to render

1013
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,500
lights in here in some kind of useful way, right?

1014
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,700
So, for example, what we could do is we start by rendering into this

1015
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,100
thing, you know, anywhere that we want lights, we render a little

1016
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,200
Splats, right?

1017
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,200
So like here are the actual lights that we have in the world or

1018
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
something, right?

1019
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,300
And then maybe we like defuse those Splats programmatically.

1020
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,900
So like we, you know, let those blur out, we like do some kind of

1021
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,300
blurring on them, right?

1022
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,800
And then we take wherever there are entities and we subtract light

1023
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,400
from there to darken it or something, right?

1024
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,600
I'm totally making this up, but you see where I'm going with this,

1025
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:19,800
right?

1026
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:25,400
Some kind of buffer that we can draw stuff into that, we can then use

1027
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,100
when we are drawing something to sample.

1028
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,100
As if we were looking out in the

1029
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,300
Various directions.

1030
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
So that when we grab a normal and we want to know what the light is,

1031
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,700
we can go.

1032
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,400
Okay.

1033
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Yeah, there's some light coming from over there, and we're going to

1034
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:43,100
put it in to our lighting equation, right?

1035
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,400
So like I said, don't know and we could do this, you know.

1036
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,100
And so basically what this is doing is it's making little light probes

1037
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,300
like every baby, every like eight by eight of this is kind of

1038
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,500
considered a little light probe you know.

1039
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,600
So when you're sampling, your just sampling, the 8x8 near you, you

1040
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,000
know, whatever you see where

1041
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,100
I'm going with this, right?

1042
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,900
And again, light is a directional problem.

1043
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,500
So it's pretty tricky because technically, like, if we have a

1044
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,500
reflection mirror over here and a light source, all the way over here,

1045
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,600
you should be able to see this in that.

1046
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,500
And how do we do that?

1047
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,400
Kind of a search, right?

1048
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,300
It's pretty tricky.

1049
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,300
So again don't really know what we're going to do here.

1050
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,200
I haven't thought about it at all and I've never tried to do anything

1051
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,100
similar to this.

1052
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,400
It's I normally work on 3D stuff.

1053
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,900
I don't do a lot of 2D work but point being we'll try, we'll give it

1054
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,000
an honest go of trying to sit down and think through what are some

1055
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,900
ways we could accelerate the lighting lookups?

1056
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,600
What are some things we could do, maybe that would lead to some more

1057
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,500
interesting lighting.

1058
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:47,000
That had more dynamism and made the scene feel more cohesive, right?

1059
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:51,400
So I think that's I'll probably wrap that up.

1060
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,900
I think we've covered most of the lighting stuff.

1061
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,700
We haven't talked specifically about how to compute letting that's

1062
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:56,900
okay.

1063
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,200
Just want to give you the overview today.

1064
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,400
And so, probably what we'll do now is, you know, maybe tomorrow.

1065
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,000
Let's, let's implement this because it's actually pretty

1066
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,700
straightforward.

1067
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,400
So, we'll talk about the light, the actual equation for lighting for

1068
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,700
one bounce and we'll do our normal maps and then we'll move on to

1069
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,400
seeing what we can do here.

1070
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,300
Because, like I said, don't know what will be able to do.

1071
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,200
We'll get a shot.

1072
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:24,500
All right, so with that, I will go ahead and and push us over to the

1073
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:24,900
Q.

1074
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,200
And the a, if you have any questions about lighting, please put Q: in

1075
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,600
front of them and we will tackle them or try to anyway.

1076
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,500
Hmm.

1077
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,200
Questions, who has questions?

1078
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,800
Questions.

1079
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,000
Questions questions.

1080
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,400
I guess we don't have any questions.

1081
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,700
Everyone was like, yep, lighting, awesome.

1082
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,300
I totally understand all of it.

1083
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,800
Now

1084
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,300
So is this why Animation Studios like Pixar have super computers for

1085
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,000
the rendering?

1086
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:32,100
Yeah, so basically like you know the weird thing about lighting is

1087
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,100
we've actually understood for a fairly long time.

1088
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,000
I guess you might say how to do pretty good computations to compute

1089
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,100
what the lighting is.

1090
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,200
It's just they're so expensive to do because they're four dimensional

1091
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,600
or worse problems.

1092
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,600
Sampling problems that we just don't have the Computing resources to

1093
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,500
solve them and so, yeah, if you want to produce high-quality images,

1094
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,700
one solution you've always had is you can get significantly better by,

1095
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,500
you know, throwing more more electricity at it and so, yeah, you know,

1096
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,600
they can they can produce much more higher quality lighting.

1097
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,600
The other reason that they have supercomputers is because they spam a

1098
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,500
lot of geometry at stuff like forfor rendering and stuff.

1099
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,700
They'll often do that and so that eats up a bunch too.

1100
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,300
It's usually lighting lettings.

1101
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,300
Usually what does it?

1102
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,800
It's very hard to actually have geometry cause you to need a

1103
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,300
supercomputer but lighting is is rough.

1104
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,700
What about Shadows?

1105
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,400
So the interesting thing about Shadows is Shadows, isn't really.

1106
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,900
A thing Shadows is just when you don't get light.

1107
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:47,400
And so really these techniques handle Shadows, right as well when you

1108
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,200
think about it.

1109
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,500
But because they are so approximated.

1110
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,300
Sometimes if you have situations like where you want sharp Shadows

1111
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
because this would, this will actually give you, you know, when

1112
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,100
you're, when you're doing something that's, it'll give you did, you

1113
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,400
know, sort of very

1114
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,600
Darkening.

1115
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,100
But if you want sharp Shadows like the sun on a Lamppost and you get

1116
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,500
that long thing, right?

1117
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,800
Then typically what people will do for that is what's called Shadow

1118
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,000
mapping, right?

1119
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:20,500
And what that is, is they will actually do the computation for a light

1120
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,900
directly for its immediate contribution.

1121
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,000
So, just its direct lighting, right, as opposed.

1122
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,500
So none of the bounce lighting.

1123
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,700
That's all done.

1124
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,300
You know, using the light probe kind of thing.

1125
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,300
But what they'll do is they'll take the direct lighting and they'll

1126
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,000
actually render A View From the Source light, right?

1127
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,200
The render of you directly from the source light and they'll use that

1128
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,100
view to let them know what the source light saw.

1129
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,400
And what it didn't and that will produce the shadow because when they

1130
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,400
light things, they look up into the light and say, did the light see

1131
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,600
me?

1132
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,300
No, it didn't.

1133
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,800
Okay.

1134
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,900
I'm in Shadow so that shadow maps and I don't think we'll need to do

1135
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
those because really

1136
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,200
We don't have, we don't really need to.

1137
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,200
I don't think there's anything in our game, where we're going to,

1138
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,300
really want to get super crisp shadows.

1139
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,800
And if we did, we could just probably take them of Sprites.

1140
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,100
So I feel like what we're going to want to what we need Dynamic like

1141
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,700
to do for us is not really Shadows.

1142
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,600
That doesn't really Define the look of a 2-D game in this style.

1143
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,300
Very much.

1144
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,700
What we want is more that environment, lighting play that sort of if

1145
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,100
there's green poison someone,

1146
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,500
I want to see some green light bounce off of stuff and I want to see

1147
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,000
things that, you know, are shadowed from the Greenlight have like a

1148
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,200
not have it on there, but that's the extent that we want shadowing.

1149
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,600
And so, I feel like a light propagation scheme is going to be more

1150
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,200
what we want and Shadow Maps, would probably just be a waste of

1151
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,900
compute for us.

1152
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,600
I think, but it's always hard to say.

1153
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,500
I was looking for a build design doc to follow.

1154
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,800
If you have one, I'm not sure what a build design doc is

1155
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,800
If you let me know what a build design, doc is, I can tell you why we

1156
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,000
don't have one because I'm almost certain that we don't, but I don't

1157
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
actually know what it is.

1158
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,800
Do we also plan on having a day-night cycle and dynamic Shadows where

1159
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,400
they stretch and fade depending on the position of the sun?

1160
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,800
No, well, okay, so

1161
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,600
Although I can appreciate why it might be nice to look at that from a

1162
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,000
technical standpoint.

1163
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,200
Like I say two things, I appreciate them, a special type of

1164
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,900
standpoint.

1165
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,800
Unfortunately, I don't like daytime for this game.

1166
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,800
So this game takes place entirely at night, so we will not have a

1167
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,800
day-night cycle in the game because I it's supposed to be kind of

1168
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,900
Adventure in a forest at night, so it never turns to be day.

1169
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:14,200
But that said this, the way that we're doing Shadows by having them in

1170
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,900
a separate pass would allow you to do that.

1171
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,200
Actually pretty easily.

1172
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:25,500
So I think our Tech would just support you just fine for that and so

1173
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,800
maybe if someone wants to make their own version, eventually that does

1174
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,700
a day-night cycle, hopefully they wouldn't have too much to do.

1175
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,800
Question, light Feathering example in a window or tree.

1176
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,900
Light Feathering.

1177
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:56,400
Are you are you referring to translucency can if you could be more

1178
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,900
specific about what you're asking, I'm not totally sure.

1179
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,300
Sort of on topic, would you consider doing a true 3D lighting or Ray

1180
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,200
tracing discussion lesson at sometime?

1181
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:15,100
I mean, I wouldn't say necessarily know, but it's, you know, that

1182
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,500
would have to be way after handmade hero because we it's just not

1183
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:20,000
something that applies to this project, you know?

1184
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,400
How do you account for infinite Reflections?

1185
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,200
If there is a mirror that reflects light into a mirror that reflects

1186
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,600
light back at the first mirror?

1187
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,300
Well, so,

1188
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,800
There's two sides to that question.

1189
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,000
The first question is, how would you handle that if you wanted to do

1190
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,200
it in a synthetic environment?

1191
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,000
And the answer there I suppose is it depends.

1192
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,600
You're going to have to do some kind of hack that you know, eventually

1193
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,200
terminates.

1194
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,000
The thing after a certain number of bounces or something like this.

1195
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,300
But if the question is, what do you do about it in the real world?

1196
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,400
The answer is the real world has no such thing, every time a photon

1197
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,500
bounces off a surface.

1198
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:11,700
It has some per percentage chance of being absorbed or scattered in a

1199
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,000
different direction by that surface.

1200
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,200
And So eventually, there is no such thing as a mirror that can bounce

1201
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:17,600
light and back.

1202
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,500
Bounce light back and forth.

1203
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,700
Infinitely eventually the light will get absorbed and that is why if

1204
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:28,100
you look at mirrors that face each other like that the reflections

1205
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,500
actually get darker eventually because it just, it can't keep sending

1206
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,300
the light back and forth, ad infinitum, because we've, I don't think

1207
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:43,600
there's such a thing as a pure, like, a totally pure reflector, I

1208
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,400
could be wrong about that.

1209
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,900
But I'm pretty much positive.

1210
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,600
No one's ever invented any such thing.

1211
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,600
Also, obviously, you have dust in the air, so you have to also be in a

1212
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,600
vacuum because light, when it hits the air, there's things called

1213
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,400
volumetric scattering, which isn't really talked about which is, is

1214
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,000
basically just the case where.

1215
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
So if you remember, I drew this thing where I sing, well technically,

1216
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,700
you have to worry about what's happening inside the surface, like I

1217
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:14,600
used wax as the example and really, the whole world works that way

1218
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,100
unless you're out in space.

1219
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,600
So if you're in a

1220
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,200
Our atmosphere, then actually anywhere in here, the light could also

1221
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,100
decide to take a detour because it could hit some particle in the air

1222
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:25,800
and bounce.

1223
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,600
And that's why you have things like, you know, real a scattering and

1224
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,200
missed.

1225
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:35,500
And you know, think the fact that things that are further away up here

1226
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:40,100
to be more washed out, that's all because there's actually scattering

1227
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,500
going on in the air as well.

1228
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,900
And so with your to mirror example, you'd be hitting that as well.

1229
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
Every time the light Transit between

1230
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,000
between the two mirrors, you would end up losing some of it to

1231
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,200
scattering that was happening.

1232
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,200
Just bought due to air molecules.

1233
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,200
And so in the real world, there's no such thing.

1234
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,600
As light to bounce back and forth infinitely as far as I know,

1235
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,200
Could you repeat that buddy mansur?

1236
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,800
I don't know what you want me to repeat.

1237
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,300
I have no coin.

1238
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,000
Bray heated, debates of why we need to go through the trouble?

1239
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You're going through just use Unity Kappa, many newcomers.

1240
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,400
So, yeah, I mean, I've said it a million times but obviously for

1241
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,000
newcomers, they haven't ever heard it.

1242
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,900
So this is not a programming stream, you know, this is this is not a

1243
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,500
game development for dummies.

1244
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,000
I won't even write that on our Blackboard.

1245
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,400
But, you know, this, this is not.

1246
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,800
How do I get a game up and running as quick as possible because

1247
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,700
there's tons of that, right?

1248
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,300
If all you want to know how to do,

1249
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,300
It's brewed up unity and whatever Unity can do.

1250
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,400
That's your game, right?

1251
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,100
If that's what you want to do, you really don't need to stream

1252
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,400
obviously because, you know, you can go just watch some tutorials in

1253
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,500
fact, I think Unity site and I probably has pretty good tutorials on

1254
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:56,800
it.

1255
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,800
I never really watched them but I suspect that they've got good

1256
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,400
training materials.

1257
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,000
I mean, why wouldn't they?

1258
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,800
That's the whole point they want people to use the engine same thing

1259
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,600
with unreal or any of these other things, right?

1260
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,200
Game maker.

1261
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,100
So if all you want to do is just get a game up and running and you

1262
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,200
don't really care about pushing any

1263
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,000
boundaries or you don't really care about being able to zero in on

1264
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,900
quality and that sort of stuff then.

1265
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,500
Yeah, but this dream is different.

1266
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,000
This stream is about learning how those things work, right?

1267
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:29,200
It's about being able to extend your ability past what the engine is

1268
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,800
capable of doing out of the box, right?

1269
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,600
And there's two ways that this can affect you one, it can allow you to

1270
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,400
do things that other people can't do.

1271
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,000
Because once you know how the lighting works, you are much more

1272
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,300
empowered to be able to.

1273
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,200
Place it modify, it hack it.

1274
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,500
Do whatever you need to do to get the effects that you want, right?

1275
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,000
And that goes not just for letting but everything that we talked about

1276
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,100
on the stream but also it means you are you're on the road if you want

1277
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:02,600
to be to sort of actually be able to work on that higher level

1278
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,400
yourself, right?

1279
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,100
You could start making your own engine so you could start making your

1280
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,800
own Unity plugins, you can start essentially giving yourself much much

1281
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,300
more power, right?

1282
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:12,500
Right.

1283
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:20,100
And, you know, it's kind of like saying, why would I want to to learn

1284
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:24,500
how to, you know, build a car when I can buy?

1285
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,000
You know, I can go buy a Honda Civic, right?

1286
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,200
And it's like, well yeah, I mean, if all you want to do is just drive

1287
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,500
a car around, you should just go buy a Honda Civic.

1288
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,400
But if you're someone who's interested in the future of cars, and

1289
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,600
about building the next car, that does awesome performance stuff that

1290
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,300
no one else does, or you wanted to invent the electric car because you

1291
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,500
Your Tesla, you were Elon Musk or something, right?

1292
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,900
That's what we're talking about in this dream.

1293
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,500
So, this stream is supposed to be the place that you come, where you

1294
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:58,000
can start getting into at a sort of starting at the ground level.

1295
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,800
Getting into that real.

1296
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,700
Game development where you actually learn, how to do everything.

1297
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,100
Not just hey.

1298
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,100
Well, if there's a button for it in unity, then I guess I can do it.

1299
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:09,800
But if there isn't, I can't

1300
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:31,400
It's 2D worth going for when it becomes more complex than 3D.

1301
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:41,600
Well so you know I can appreciate why sometimes on the stream.

1302
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:46,100
It may look like 2D is more complicated than 3D because anytime I'm

1303
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,500
going to mention 3D is that circumstance, right?

1304
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,300
And so every time I'm going to mention 3D, it's going to be because

1305
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,300
I'm saying well in 2D we don't have access to this.

1306
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,000
So this is why we're, you know, why it's a little harder for us here,

1307
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,500
right?

1308
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,800
What you don't see is the 8 billion things that are harder, if you're

1309
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,000
implementing stuff in 3D because we don't have to do them right.

1310
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,400
So 3D carries with it, just huge amounts of hard stuff that you're

1311
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,300
just not seeing because I'm not having to teach you how to do it,

1312
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,500
because we're in 2D and it's really good idea to start with 2D first

1313
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,300
because that is the case.

1314
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:23,700
And usually, you know, I mean, I'll give you a very simple example,

1315
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:24,200
right?

1316
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,600
Let's suppose we wanted to do this, okay?

1317
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,100
All of this stuff that I'm talking about here.

1318
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,600
You actually have to implement this stuff in 3D, it's incredibly

1319
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,400
complicated.

1320
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,500
You need to come up with surface reflectance functions, you need to

1321
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,000
come up with approximation so service professionals have to Source

1322
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
them from somewhere.

1323
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,700
How are you going to do that, right?

1324
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:46,600
You have to handle transparency in orders that you can't predict, you

1325
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,900
have to sort the stuff in your scene, into two groups and then sort

1326
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:50,100
this.

1327
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,500
The, the transparent groups that, you know, that you can handle them

1328
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,700
in the correct order, right?

1329
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,100
You then have to worry about when you're doing

1330
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,000
Part of this rendering here, right?

1331
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
This this Cube map rendering how often?

1332
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,000
And where are the cube apps going to be placed and what are the

1333
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,600
numerical consequences of where the cube map was relative to where the

1334
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
object was because they're not going to be exactly, right?

1335
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,000
So then you have to interpolate from multiple probes in the world like

1336
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,399
to try and try to triangulate your position and then wait a minute,

1337
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,600
something's in the world.

1338
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,500
If they're translucent they should allow light to pass through but

1339
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,399
they'd have to call her that light and blah blah blah, right?

1340
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,399
So there's like it's incredibly complicated.

1341
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,500
If you actually want to do it in 3D as

1342
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,000
As well.

1343
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:34,300
So I don't mean to give the impression that 3D is easier anything like

1344
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:34,600
this.

1345
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:40,200
And also, you know, you can see this in a lot of systems like even in

1346
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:44,100
when you use a licensed engine, they're only now getting to the point

1347
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,899
where you don't have to do a ton of pre-computation like unreal for, I

1348
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:51,100
think, finally has lighting down to a better sort of solution where

1349
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,500
you can kind of do it a little more real time and actually looks good

1350
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,500
and everything right?

1351
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,200
And so it's been a very, very long hard Road for 3D Graphics to get to

1352
01:08:59,200 --> 01:08:59,899
that point as well.

1353
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,600
And if you were to see the stuff that we would be doing, If This Were

1354
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,600
3D handmade hero to do lighting, you would be very, very unhappy.

1355
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,399
I promise you that because there's a ton of stuff involved there.

1356
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,700
Not to mention, we'd have to be an HDR, which is a whole another

1357
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,100
issue.

1358
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,600
Is your lighting Cube idea.

1359
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,000
The same thing as cube Maps.

1360
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,700
So I was, I'm sorry, if I didn't say, I thought I said Cube Maps here,

1361
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,899
I was describing Cube Maps.

1362
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,300
That's what I was describing here when I was saying, this is how

1363
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:40,300
sometimes people do it in 3D, they call them light probes and they're

1364
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:44,300
typically Cube Maps or something similar rendered at various locations

1365
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,600
throughout the world that they then interpolate between.

1366
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,300
And you know, that's just one example of one scheme.

1367
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,200
There are many ski

1368
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:58,300
Things that one might employ to do sort of the indirect lighting part

1369
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,600
of the indirect lighting equation.

1370
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,600
Because really, that's what this is all about, right?

1371
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,300
There's the direct term and the indirect term.

1372
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,100
Right and this one's the easy one.

1373
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,000
The direct part of the lighting is just the part where the light

1374
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,600
bounced off the surface directly into your eye, right?

1375
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,700
That's really simple.

1376
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,300
So, you know, the and I when I say light, I don't mean the generic

1377
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:20,500
light.

1378
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:25,400
I mean, like the light source, like the sun, you know, the direct path

1379
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,500
that the sun took off that surface directly to your eye.

1380
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,700
The indirect part which is all the other stuff coming from everywhere

1381
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,800
else where the sun bounced off something and hit it or whatever,

1382
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,000
right?

1383
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,200
That's the hard part because it's coming from every direction.

1384
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,400
This is One Direction.

1385
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,700
Like the band I'm sure there are fantastic, rock group or whatever it

1386
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,800
is that they do and this is many directions and many directions as

1387
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,500
much more difficult.

1388
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:51,100
They don't sell hardly as many albums.

1389
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,500
How to feather light through a window or tree?

1390
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,700
So I guess I so you're trying to clarify the question for that doesn't

1391
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,600
really clarified unfortunately but

1392
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,800
I'll answer the question about trip as if it's about translucence,

1393
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,200
hoping this will help you because I'm not sure what you're asking.

1394
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,600
But here's translucence.

1395
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,300
So, let's suppose I take the classic example of translucence.

1396
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,500
And and we'll say, inside, Japan and outside Japan.

1397
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,800
So the classic example, in Japan would be a Shoji screen, right?

1398
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,900
You ever seen these things?

1399
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,800
They're like, they're kind of cool.

1400
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,100
They got like a lattice of wood, right?

1401
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,300
And then inside the lattice of would there's like this, this sort of

1402
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,700
paper, this like, you know, sort of paper and they're very

1403
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,800
characteristic because what happens is they are just kind of, they

1404
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,300
just kind of light up when there's light on the other side, like the

1405
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:58,600
sun on the side, they just kind of our nice, a nice pleasant gray.

1406
01:11:59,500 --> 01:11:59,800
And if

1407
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,500
One was standing here really close to them.

1408
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,700
You would see their Shadow projected onto it, right, but you'll never

1409
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,500
see them.

1410
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,600
So it's not transparent, right?

1411
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,400
Because not a transparent surface.

1412
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,500
It is a translucent surface.

1413
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,700
And if you're anywhere, besides Japan, then that's where the tree

1414
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:19,300
comes in.

1415
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,200
So, if you're to look through a leaf, right?

1416
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,600
One of the leaves of a tree at the sun, right?

1417
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,900
You kind of see this brightness there and if there was another leaf

1418
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:30,800
that was obscuring it.

1419
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,800
You'd see the Shadow on there, right?

1420
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,600
So you kind of see the presence of light

1421
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,500
On the other side but you don't see the actual objects at.

1422
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,300
All right?

1423
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,600
And that's translucence, I assume that's what you're talking about.

1424
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,100
I'm not sure.

1425
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,600
The reason is because you said feather, light through a window.

1426
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,800
But a window is transparent, really.

1427
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,800
All a window does is have an index of refraction which bends light,

1428
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,700
but it doesn't tend to really absorb it or re scatter it in that way,

1429
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,400
but so I'm going to just answer the question for translucence.

1430
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,600
And so the answer here is translucence is really

1431
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,200
Is really actually pretty straightforward.

1432
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,600
It's another aspect of the indirect light transport.

1433
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,200
So, remember how I said, okay, I'm viewing the surface right?

1434
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,300
And here's the light.

1435
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,200
Okay.

1436
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:23,700
Right.

1437
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,600
So, if I wanted to start and you know, I've got my indirect light

1438
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,900
coming in from here, right?

1439
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,200
Bouncing off.

1440
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,300
If I want to start handling translucent Services, they are typically

1441
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,800
thin, what you end up doing, is you just have an infinitely thin your

1442
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,400
polygon or whatever it is, right?

1443
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:45,100
And you have the light that comes from the back.

1444
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,900
So if the sun's back here and there's indirect light coming from all

1445
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:52,700
of these angles, what you start doing is you actually look at the

1446
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,500
light that comes in here and you scan

1447
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,000
That light through the other side, right?

1448
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,200
So, basically, all translucence is, is indirect lighting equations

1449
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,200
that are operating off the back of an object?

1450
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,700
Instead of just the front, right?

1451
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:10,500
Hopefully, that helps

1452
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,400
Why don't we just have the lighting feigned on the Sprites?

1453
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,300
The reason is because we don't know ahead of time where the light is

1454
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:25,900
coming from.

1455
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,200
So if we want the light to be able to circle around the tree and the

1456
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,900
tree to light up differently, depending on where it is, there's no way

1457
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,700
we can bake that into the Sprite, we need to be able to compute it

1458
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,500
dynamically.

1459
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,300
So the lighting that we can bake into the Sprite is the kind that you

1460
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,300
see here where, you know, which is what we'll do, which is like sort

1461
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,300
of a general lighting and self shadowing of the light of the, of the

1462
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,100
Free on itself, but in terms of light, that moves around the object in

1463
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,400
order to portray that we have to be able to compute it dynamically.

1464
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,400
How about the second frame buffer?

1465
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,300
You mentioned with light sources, having precomputed distance fall-off

1466
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,200
plus Graphics objects.

1467
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Having another Channel similar to Alpha.

1468
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:29,200
That indicates reflectivity that would be fast and maybe good enough

1469
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,000
for a 2-D game.

1470
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:30,900
Yeah.

1471
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,400
And so, that's, that's sort of what I was getting at.

1472
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,300
When I was saying, you know, we be blurring it out.

1473
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,200
There was like, you know, that's the distance fall-off.

1474
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,700
So the problem and this is again, this is why lighting is so hard.

1475
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,000
This is why lighting is even more difficult than say fluid dynamics.

1476
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,600
Or other volumetric things.

1477
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:57,700
It's because lighting at least in 2D, lighting doesn't care how far

1478
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:59,000
the light travels really.

1479
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:03,400
So, the problem is that again, and this is something I didn't mention

1480
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,400
because this is not supposed to be a complete course on lighting.

1481
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:09,800
So, you know, I gave you the very, very simple overview of everything.

1482
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,400
It gets a lot more complex if you go all the way down the rabbit hole.

1483
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,000
But basically like what

1484
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,200
One thing you might say is illumination.

1485
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,400
Is constant.

1486
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,800
Along a line.

1487
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
And this is the big thing about lighting.

1488
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,900
Basically, when light starts traveling in a line, it just goes in that

1489
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,700
line forever.

1490
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,700
And if it doesn't hit anything, it will be just as bright when it hits

1491
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,300
the end as it was, when it started, right?

1492
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,600
And so really, the only thing that's making light get dimmer ever is

1493
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,500
when it hits something.

1494
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:52,600
Now, unfortunately, for us are just isn't that thick.

1495
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,200
So when you have something like in in our game, where we have a light

1496
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:58,800
source over here,

1497
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:01,100
And something all the way over here.

1498
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,700
Let's say that was highly reflective like a mirror ball, right?

1499
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:11,800
Well, this light should be super bright in this mirror ball and it's

1500
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,000
all the way on the other side.

1501
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
There's no fall-off like lights.

1502
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,500
Don't have a fall off, that's really, not a thing.

1503
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,900
The fall off of light at the scale that we're talking about is

1504
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,000
literally non-existent.

1505
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
It does not happen unless there's some real thick fog in here or

1506
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,900
something, right?

1507
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,900
And so, fall off really isn't quite right now.

1508
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,500
What we may do again, like I said, because we don't have the luxury of

1509
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,100
it is

1510
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:40,300
They just end up using a false because we have to write and that might

1511
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:40,800
be what we do.

1512
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,900
Because again, you know, with games, you have to compute in real time.

1513
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:47,200
You just don't have the ability to just say, well, we're going to just

1514
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,600
simulate everything accurately.

1515
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,900
That's not an option.

1516
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:52,900
So we'll see what our approximate approximation ends up being, but

1517
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:55,700
it's always worth noting that things like fall off, don't even really

1518
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,600
happen with lights.

1519
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,900
And so that's a bit rough, but what we could do is

1520
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Maybe like, you know again maybe we use Point lighting to get that and

1521
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,900
then our diffuse lighting, well maybe we don't care because you

1522
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,600
wouldn't see the diffuse lighting travel that far, right?

1523
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,800
And so the fall off can help can happen there or something, right?

1524
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,300
Due to the complexity of lighting, our system resources a major factor

1525
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:43,300
consideration in shading engines sure.

1526
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:50,000
I mean, you know, if you go look at when you, you know, can tweak a

1527
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,600
game settings, oftentimes like Shadow detail and things like this, are

1528
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,600
things that that get set in the game settings.

1529
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,300
So, you know, it's definitely the case that the beefier the GPU and a

1530
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,600
machine, the more lighting you could do on it, right?

1531
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,200
If that's

1532
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,300
If that's what you're asking.

1533
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,100
I'm not totally sure.

1534
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,000
I know what you're asking though.

1535
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,900
if you use a 2d lighting buffer will you need to generate a g buffer

1536
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,200
or Z buffer as well first

1537
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,500
Well, probably not a z-buffer but we're going to need something to

1538
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,000
control the propagation here.

1539
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,100
So we'll G buffer is probably sort of something.

1540
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:32,600
Like what we might use in the sense that we want to be able to knock

1541
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:37,400
out, put to prevent light from traveling in the direction where there

1542
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,600
are solid objects, we want to, you know, reduce the amount of light.

1543
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,600
So we'll see how we do that.

1544
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,100
I'm not sure how we'll do it.

1545
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,600
What about bleeding, affects?

1546
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,500
I do not know what that means.

1547
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,400
Is this going to work with software rendering?

1548
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,100
Or will it be to computationally expensive?

1549
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,300
Well, we'll implement it in software rendering and if it turns out

1550
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,500
that we can't get it to run fast enough, we'll just turn it off in the

1551
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:09,400
software renderer.

1552
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,200
But yeah, if so if it's too slow and we can optimize it enough then

1553
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,100
we'll only run it on the GPU path.

1554
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,900
But you know, will at least make it work correctly, in the software,

1555
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,300
the software path so that we can see how to do it.

1556
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,500
And then if we have to

1557
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,300
I am GPU horsepower to actually render it real time for the gameplay

1558
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,000
that's fine.

1559
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,800
You mentioned Computing values for a single Source, receiving light

1560
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,800
from multiple sources.

1561
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,700
How would we in essence do this computation?

1562
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,400
I'm assuming this is based off neighboring, pixel values.

1563
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,100
I'm having a hard time formulating and approach.

1564
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,400
So, again, the approach is kind of the same.

1565
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,700
As I was talking about up here, what I'm thinking is, basically, you

1566
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,800
know, we compute something

1567
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,900
Which we then subsample down.

1568
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,500
So we have our 256 by 128, you know, and we sample that down to a 128

1569
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,900
by 64 and a 64 by 32.

1570
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:18,600
And 32 by 16 is 16 by 8 and an 8 by 4 and a 4 by 2 and a 2 by 1 and a

1571
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,300
1 by 1, right.

1572
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,200
And then when we want to get blurrier and blurrier versions of the

1573
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,900
light that's coming from an area, we would just sample those, right?

1574
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:31,800
So yeah.

1575
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,800
So I don't know what we're going to do.

1576
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,500
Exactly.

1577
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,200
We will play around with it and again, like I said, one of the things

1578
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,700
I like to do on the stream is I like to tackle some problems on the

1579
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,100
string that I've never talked to before, because one of the things I

1580
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,200
like showing the stream is how to tackle problems.

1581
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,700
And if all I ever do is show you stuff that I already know how to do.

1582
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,700
Well, that doesn't really show you how to tackle new problems, right?

1583
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:54,500
So

1584
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,200
So, we'll play around with it, we'll see where we get.

1585
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,100
Wouldn't it in most cases be smarter to use an existing graphic render

1586
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,000
engine and just focus on coding the game itself, gameplay.

1587
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,000
Well, you know,

1588
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,600
Asking question in the abstract like that presupposes that you already

1589
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:31,100
had a specific goal in mind and that goal was to make some gameplay,

1590
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:32,300
right?

1591
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,600
And so if your entire goal is that you wanted to make some gameplay

1592
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:43,200
then yes it would probably be a much smarter idea not to spend your

1593
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,000
time coding graphics.

1594
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,000
However, I don't think it is a good idea to assume that what makes a

1595
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
game or what makes a game developer.

1596
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,000
Is just the fact that someone sat down and was only thinking about

1597
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,200
gameplay, right?

1598
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,700
Game development is an entire discipline.

1599
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:08,500
It is not about you had some specific idea for gameplay.

1600
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,000
And the only thing that you wanted to do was Implement some gameplay,

1601
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,600
right?

1602
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,500
That's sort of like saying, why would you paint a picture of a flower

1603
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,100
when you could take a photograph of the flower, right?

1604
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:25,600
And it's like, well, that presupposes, that your goal was to reproduce

1605
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,300
a flower.

1606
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,100
Accurately, as possible, a particular flower somewhere, right?

1607
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,500
And so what I would like to emphasize is that game, development is a

1608
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:41,400
thing that you do it is like any other artistic Endeavor.

1609
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,900
There are many aspects to it and where you find enjoyment.

1610
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,700
May not be the same as someone else and presupposing a singular

1611
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,100
purpose that is I just want to get gameplay as quickly as possible

1612
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:56,300
onto the screen supposes that you had a very specific goal.

1613
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,900
All in mind and I for one never have that particular goal in mind.

1614
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,500
and I suspect, there are many other people who don't either

1615
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,200
and those are the people who just enjoy developing games in general,

1616
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:07,900
right?

1617
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:12,200
They enjoy the process of making the parts of a game which may have

1618
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:14,900
nothing to do with the Gameplay at the end of the day, right?

1619
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,100
And to emphasize how important this is to everyone that there are

1620
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:18,900
people like this.

1621
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:23,800
The only reason you even have the option of using an existing renderer

1622
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,500
or some other technology or engine is because there were people who

1623
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,700
didn't just sit around thinking well I just want to make some

1624
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,800
gameplay, right?

1625
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,200
And so it

1626
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:38,000
It's all sort of aspects of the discipline to move the discipline

1627
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:38,500
forward.

1628
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,300
And it's very important that there are people out there who enjoy

1629
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,700
working on all the different pieces.

1630
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,600
And so like I said, this dream is for the people who want to know how

1631
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,900
to build the whole game.

1632
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,900
Not people who just want to put some gameplay on the screen because

1633
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:56,000
you can just go down, get download Game Maker, if that's all you

1634
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,300
wanted to do right?

1635
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,600
What is the, what is the ambient occlusion?

1636
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,800
And why my video card get late to run games with ambient occlusion,

1637
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,400
like really lose FPS?

1638
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:20,700
So I can't speak to specifically why a particular game might be

1639
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:25,900
running more slowly with ambient occlusion or anything like that, but

1640
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,600
I could give you some hypothetical answers.

1641
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,600
I can tell you what it is so ambient occlusion, we didn't have to talk

1642
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,100
about thankfully, and the reason for that is because it's baked into

1643
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:40,400
the Sprites actually fairly well, but let's talk about what it means.

1644
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,900
So ambient occlusion is a term that actually

1645
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,500
It's not real, right?

1646
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,000
It's not a real thing.

1647
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,300
Okay.

1648
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,000
All the stuff I talked about up there before we're real things.

1649
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,800
Ambient occlusion is a term that actually refers to in effect of real

1650
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,300
things.

1651
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,400
Not some aspect of what's actually happening to the light and what

1652
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,900
it's referring to is the fact that if you take a look at a surface,

1653
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,900
okay, let's say I have a surface that looks like this.

1654
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:17,400
Well, my light source is able to hit all of the pieces of this

1655
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,000
surface.

1656
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:23,000
So when I am rendering it, I do not have to consider the fact that

1657
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,800
there is light getting absorbed by the surface.

1658
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,500
When I light this surface and vice-versa A and B are completely

1659
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,700
unrelated, okay?

1660
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
However, if I were to come to consider the same light source now

1661
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,300
operating on a different surface, right?

1662
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,400
Let's suppose the surface looked like this, okay?

1663
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:49,500
As the light kind of comes in here, what you can see is that a certain

1664
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,500
degree of the light that should have been falling on?

1665
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:58,100
This surface is not going to fall on it because other surfaces in the

1666
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,800
area where preventing that from happening.

1667
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:01,000
Right?

1668
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,800
So the light comes from over here.

1669
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,700
Yes, I can hit it but if the light comes from over here, I can't.

1670
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:10,100
Furthermore, if it looked more like this, then I've got even more of

1671
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,300
that happening, right?

1672
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,300
Light from anywhere.

1673
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:15,300
Here is going to Shadow this interior part, light from in here, it's

1674
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:16,400
going to Shadow it and so on.

1675
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:21,600
So ambient occlusion refers to the process and again.

1676
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,400
So ambient, meaning light from all directions, not a specific

1677
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:32,000
Direction and occlusion meaning to block right ambient, occlusion is a

1678
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:39,200
fake and actually kind of lousy approximation to recapturing.

1679
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,800
Some of the detail that is lost because you're not actually doing

1680
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,200
letting calculations at the Fidelity necessary to capture these

1681
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:44,800
effects.

1682
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,100
So what happens is you take a surface

1683
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,200
Like this, you take a look at this here.

1684
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,800
And you say, well, I'm going to before I ever run the game before I do

1685
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,400
anything.

1686
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,000
I'm going to look and see how much of the Horizon can see, right?

1687
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,300
And more specifically for a particular Texel.

1688
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,700
So like right there, you know, like right right.

1689
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:06,600
That point I'm going to cast out the Horizon.

1690
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,200
I'm going to see that.

1691
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:08,700
Okay?

1692
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:11,600
It can see about that much, right.

1693
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:17,200
So when I am lighting things just in general, when I'm using the

1694
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,800
indirect lighting terms, so light coming from everywhere.

1695
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,600
If it can only see 25% of the Horizon, I'm just going to multiply the

1696
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,300
incoming light by 25% and call that the darkening effect right call

1697
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,200
that ambient occlusion

1698
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,600
and so what ends up happening is in places where objects have

1699
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:39,900
crenellations or folds, you know in skews things it darkens them

1700
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,500
so that's ambient occlusion and there's two types are typically used,

1701
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,200
there's baked

1702
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,900
and there's screen space.

1703
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,600
So there's baked ambient occlusion screen size and of inclusion.

1704
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:56,700
Baked ambient occlusion is when you do exactly this process offline.

1705
01:28:57,100 --> 01:29:00,100
So, I take my object, whatever it is, I go through it.

1706
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,000
And I have a texture map that covers its surface, and at every text on

1707
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,400
a texture map, I see how much of the Horizon it can see my saying

1708
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,800
arise, I don't mean that I really mean hemisphere right?

1709
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,800
The hemisphere around it, and I bake that into a term.

1710
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,300
That's the ambient occlusion term.

1711
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,300
Now it can get fancier.

1712
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:21,900
Because there are ways oftentimes using things called spherical

1713
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,100
harmonics, which we're not going to talk about.

1714
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:32,800
Or other kinds of bases, there are ways of trying to encode, not just

1715
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,700
how much of the hemisphere has seen.

1716
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
But actually what sort of General region of the hemisphere you saw,

1717
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,100
and that allows you to do more directional ambient occlusion, right?

1718
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:48,500
But anyway, baked Deo computes that everywhere on the model and writes

1719
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:49,400
it into a texture map.

1720
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,400
So this comes up as a texture map /, / model, right or you know,

1721
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:54,700
textures that cover

1722
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:59,800
The model that say how much you can see and off you go screen space.

1723
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,600
Inclusion is a totally different idea.

1724
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,200
What screen space ambient occlusion is, and this, these tend to look

1725
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:07,800
real bad.

1726
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,000
But, you know, some engines do it better than others.

1727
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,500
But what this is, is this goes ahead and says, all right, look, we all

1728
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,900
we know we've already got a z-buffer, right?

1729
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,800
We already rendered a z-buffer into the scene.

1730
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,800
So we actually already know when we draw this thing, right?

1731
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,000
We actually already know the depth value at every pixel.

1732
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,900
So if there was a place in the scene that has

1733
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,600
I'd like an in skews part like that and we wanted to darken it in

1734
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,500
there because of that, what we could do is at every point on the

1735
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:41,600
screen we could look at the depth values in screen space that are

1736
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,900
nearby it and decide based on those deaf values whether we think there

1737
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,500
were things that would be shadowing.

1738
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:51,600
It that are nearby and based on the collection of those depth samples

1739
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,100
we will then darken the incoming lighting for that point.

1740
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:01,300
Okay, so that's screen space ambient occlusion again, these are not

1741
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:01,900
real things.

1742
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,800
These are hacks that are designed to increase the degree to which you

1743
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,100
capture in skews Lighting on things because typical game lighting

1744
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:15,800
can't handle doesn't do full computations there, right?

1745
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,900
Like remember I said there's that cubemap lighting trick so if you

1746
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:21,900
imagine something like that happening on an object?

1747
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,400
Well, it's not ever casting any raise that?

1748
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,700
It's never not ever seeing if it.

1749
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:30,400
Actually reach that cubemap, it's just assuming that it can and so you

1750
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,000
never get that self shadowing.

1751
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,800
That's what the ambient occlusion terms trying to put back in, but

1752
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
it's not a real thing.

1753
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,900
It's just a technique.

1754
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,700
It's like a hack to try and reproduce What would actually be

1755
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:41,100
happening.

1756
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,800
If you were Computing, the leading equation at every point for the

1757
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,800
whole light field.

1758
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:50,200
Auntie Songbird cake.

1759
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,800
I do not prefer muffins.

1760
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,000
Do you have any plans to implement Sprite?

1761
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,800
Opacity, we already do Implement.

1762
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,600
Sprite opacity Sprites can be as translucent as they want to be.

1763
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,700
And if so, could this be taken into consideration with the lightmap

1764
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,300
calculations?

1765
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,000
I less opaque.

1766
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,300
Objects block less light.

1767
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,800
Yeah, and we could even try to make translucent objects are

1768
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:19,700
transparent.

1769
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:23,100
But colored objects transmit, that light color.

1770
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,200
I don't know.

1771
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,100
We'll see what we can do.

1772
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,700
You know, we'll just give it a shot.

1773
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,000
That's one of the fun things about writing your own Graphics engine.

1774
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,100
We could come up with some techniques that no one's ever done before

1775
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,500
maybe they look good or maybe look awful but it's a lot of fun to play

1776
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,900
around with and so that's when things will do it.

1777
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,000
Maybe that's what will spend next week doing just playing around.

1778
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,900
See what we get.

1779
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,100
Are there any books or resources you would recommend on lighting?

1780
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,700
So, you know, I guess I've never read it myself.

1781
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:54,100
But there is a book on lighting that a lot of people rep recommend.

1782
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,400
Let me see.

1783
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,200
It's by, I think it's by Matt far.

1784
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,900
Yeah, this is the one

1785
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:12,900
This, this book.

1786
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:20,300
Yeah, I feel like this is a book that a lot of people respect.

1787
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:28,300
I have not read it myself, so, you know, don't take me if it turns out

1788
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:32,000
to be awful or something, but I believe, if you want to know the math

1789
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:37,200
behind how light actually works and how to simulate it, I feel like

1790
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:42,400
that's one of the books that people recommend for a good, you know, a

1791
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,200
good kind of

1792
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,900
Full overview.

1793
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:52,400
Twister.

1794
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,000
So game design, documentation, like a roadmap for the game.

1795
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:55,700
No.

1796
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,200
So we are not doing anything like that.

1797
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,000
This is a game implementation Stream.

1798
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,000
So the design is kind of a separate thing that we don't really work

1799
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:04,300
with.

1800
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,800
We just do programming the engine and then the gameplay as well will

1801
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,500
be programming it.

1802
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,100
But we're not actually talking about that part because I'm not really

1803
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:12,800
a game designer.

1804
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,900
So I don't want to try to give lessons on how to do game design

1805
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,600
because I'm the wrong guy for that.

1806
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:21,300
So yeah, so we're not dealing with any of that stuff.

1807
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:24,900
In terms of design docs or anything like that.

1808
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,000
Wouldn't a game in Pitch Darkness at the easiest lighting system to

1809
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:31,500
code?

1810
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,900
Yes, it would.

1811
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:38,300
And they're almost was a game that was done in complete pitch

1812
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:44,300
Darkness, you may have heard of it, it was called alone in the dark.

1813
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:51,900
And my understanding was It was supposed to be entirely Audio Only but

1814
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:55,000
the publisher eventually made them change it and so then they ended up

1815
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,600
doing it as a bitmap with 2D objects over it game.

1816
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:05,300
This was the original one of the dark, not the Remake, obviously, but

1817
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:07,400
it was very successful anyway, but my understanding was that was

1818
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,900
originally supposed to literally be a black screen and the game was

1819
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:15,600
played entirely and audio, but they made a change that so so it didn't

1820
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,000
happen.

1821
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,600
That would have had very easy lighting.

1822
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:23,200
Can you go back in time and start this series, 15 years ago?

1823
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,300
I would love to be able to go back in time.

1824
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:26,000
15 years.

1825
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,200
You don't know how much I would love to do that.

1826
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,100
If you can provide me with some sort of a device that would allow me

1827
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:31,400
to do.

1828
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:35,400
So I would happily start the series 15 years ago.

1829
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:39,900
Course we wouldn't have twitch and YouTube and stuff so we'd have to

1830
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:43,000
figure out a way that we were going to transmit it, but I'm sure we

1831
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,700
can figure it out.

1832
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,200
And T song bird.

1833
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,400
It is neither cheese.

1834
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,000
Nor mud cake.

1835
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,800
I like the sort of cake with buttercream frosting.

1836
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,200
Okay so we're still trying to chase down this question.

1837
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:13,400
What I mean is sort of more like how to make beams of light passed

1838
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,000
through a rendered object.

1839
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:20,400
Okay so and and Garland oh Bloom tries to clarify I think they meant

1840
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,100
God raised.

1841
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:21,900
Okay.

1842
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,100
So, God raised.

1843
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:30,300
Is actually volumetric scattering.

1844
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:35,700
Okay.

1845
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:41,800
So the way that this works is, there's no such thing as beams of light

1846
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,300
right there.

1847
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:45,100
Just photons flying through the air and what's actually happening.

1848
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:51,800
That when the reason this occurs is when the are around something is

1849
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,300
highly particulate, right?

1850
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,200
So it's typically bright light.

1851
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,800
So there's a lot of photons, right?

1852
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:06,600
Lots of photons and heavy are, right?

1853
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,800
Lots of particles.

1854
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,400
Right?

1855
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:19,200
So typically about sunlight, bright sunlight, Misty are that sort of

1856
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,100
thing and and or Dusty.

1857
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,000
That's when you get into these heavy volumetric scattering situations

1858
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,400
and what's happening there is you end up with stuff like, okay, I've

1859
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,200
got a window, right?

1860
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,500
And it has, you know, it's got

1861
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:42,000
You know it's got Jesus in it, right?

1862
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:47,600
And a vampire or whatever and Jesus is like about to kill the vampire

1863
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,700
with a steak or something, right?

1864
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:50,000
I don't know.

1865
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,200
It's a stained glass window.

1866
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,100
Is my point.

1867
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,600
I don't know if the vampire.

1868
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,600
Maybe it's got some bat wings or something on there.

1869
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,900
So, there's a stained glass window, right?

1870
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,500
And the lights on the other side of it and it's coming through.

1871
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,500
And what you're asking about is like, well, they, the these, these

1872
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,800
colored light rays that like pass through, right?

1873
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:06,900
Or

1874
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:07,700
Like this.

1875
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,400
And the way that that happens is the light.

1876
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:16,600
When it hits the stained glass window, the stained glass, the the

1877
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,500
whole point of stained glass is it absorbs certain colors and lets

1878
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,500
others pass through.

1879
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,000
So, if you see red stained glass, like, you know, Jesus has

1880
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,100
vampire-killing.

1881
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,300
Steak is like dripping some blood or whatever.

1882
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,100
So that's red, right.

1883
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,100
What that means is it?

1884
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,900
Absorbs stuff outside of that wavelength.

1885
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,800
So basically like here's red on the wavelength Spectrum here is like a

1886
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,900
bunch of other things.

1887
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:40,000
It's absorbing all of this light into the glass and it's letting this

1888
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,700
pass through.

1889
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,600
So the light on this side may be whatever color but when it comes to

1890
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:44,700
here it's going to be red.

1891
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,500
What then happens is all of these photons that are streaming through

1892
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:51,600
here that are read, they hit all that particle matter in the air.

1893
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,100
All the dust that's in the that's in the spooky church or whatever,

1894
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:55,700
right?

1895
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,300
And it hits that and scatters in all directions, some of those

1896
01:38:59,300 --> 01:38:59,800
directions.

1897
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,900
Back to your eye.

1898
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,100
And so, that's what's actually happening.

1899
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
It's a volumetric scattering problem.

1900
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:10,400
And so, you know, if the ant if the question is, how do I Implement

1901
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,500
that in a ray Tracer?

1902
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:13,600
Well, the answer is you literally do the volumetric.

1903
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:18,900
Scattering what you do is when you cast raise right, you have volumes

1904
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:23,600
and they are defined as having a certain density of volumetric

1905
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:27,600
particles in them and as the ray passes through them you compute a

1906
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,500
percentage chance of it getting scattered.

1907
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,100
And then you if it hits you scatter that Ray and you you know sample

1908
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,600
that proportional to what you believe the incoming light field is in

1909
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:41,000
an unbiased way and all this other nonsense, right?

1910
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:45,400
If you're trying to figure out how to do that in a game, then you're

1911
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,900
in hack territory, right?

1912
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:49,500
Because volumetric scattering is one of those things that, you know,

1913
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,700
you got to do an approximation to of some kind.

1914
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:57,600
And so, I have to say, I don't know what the current, I'm sorry.

1915
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,400
I don't know what the current like, you know, slickest technique is

1916
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:02,000
for that.

1917
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,300
I don't know.

1918
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,800
For God raised I suspect that it would have something to do with, you

1919
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:16,700
know, taking one of these guys and going well okay, we're going to

1920
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:20,600
presuppose that we know what our services are that.

1921
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:25,200
That do God Ray pass through stuff and you know, we're going to go

1922
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:28,300
ahead and we're going to start off.

1923
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:32,500
If they might just do it in screen space now.

1924
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,700
Now that I think about it.

1925
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,000
Yeah, okay, so there's probably there's probably a screen space way to

1926
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,900
do this now, actually, because we've got so much ability to do that.

1927
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,900
I wonder I, you what they might do is just take a look.

1928
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:51,400
They might just take a look at like, render places that want to have

1929
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:52,600
volumetric effects in them.

1930
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,500
They might just use screen space for that.

1931
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:55,000
I don't know.

1932
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,200
You should look this up.

1933
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,300
I wonder if there's some stuff because this is what I was missing.

1934
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,200
I want if your screen space, godrej techniques now seems like that's

1935
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,900
the way you do it and you would kind of go through the screen.

1936
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You would see if you had godrej pixels.

1937
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,400
If you did, you would sort of set them.

1938
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:13,000
You would do, maybe perhaps the raycast just right there or you do a

1939
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,600
cube map, look up, right there.

1940
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,600
That, that seems that might be.

1941
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:16,800
So,

1942
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,400
It might actually be that you do this in screen space nowadays.

1943
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,700
I don't know, I'd be curious to know.

1944
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,400
I've never implemented.

1945
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,200
God raised in at all.

1946
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,300
Really, I've never tried to implement godrej, so I don't know.

1947
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,400
But that's that's what's actually happening.

1948
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,300
I suspect that nowadays maybe screen space is how they would do that,

1949
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,100
because it seems like that's probably probably the only way to really

1950
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,100
handle it without doing anything crazy.

1951
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:52,300
Don't You cast Rays from the eye and not the sun to reduce

1952
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,000
calculations?

1953
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
And then see if the Rays cast from the I hit the Sun.

1954
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,800
So I'm not sure what you're actually referring to.

1955
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,700
Has again, like in games, we don't really do a whole lot of Ray

1956
01:42:04,700 --> 01:42:05,000
tracing.

1957
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,200
I mean, sometimes we do for computing, things nowadays, but you don't

1958
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:13,400
really cast raised from light sources or from eyes.

1959
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,800
If that makes sense.

1960
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:19,700
You do render Shadow maps from like light sources.

1961
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:23,400
So in that sense you are casting Rays from the Sun if you will.

1962
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
So yeah, you don't do that way.

1963
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,700
But if you're making a ray Tracer, the

1964
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Sir is typically that you do, you do go from the eye out in purely

1965
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,200
Monte Carlo, right?

1966
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:42,900
Racers in like in the is a purely Monte Carlo.

1967
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:46,200
He forward Monte Carlo rate Racers which are fairly common.

1968
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,000
You go from the ayat where it's but

1969
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:53,800
In a whole Suite of other ones, you actually go from both.

1970
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:55,700
They're called bi-directional path tracers.

1971
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:04,300
So, like Metropolis ones, they go from both bi-directional rate by

1972
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,300
directional path tracers, go from both.

1973
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:10,000
So, no, I mean, the answer is, is you don't exclusively go for one or

1974
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,600
the other.

1975
01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:14,300
It really depends on what you're implementing, which one you go from,

1976
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:14,900
for what?

1977
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:31,600
Can you use a 3D overlay to pretend say a slice of a 3D environment.

1978
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,500
For example, the platform you're on being Z and then X is across y up

1979
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:40,400
and down, so you can have a light source at x-33 y50, Z1.

1980
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:44,100
So all objects, less than x 33 would be shadowed to the right objects,

1981
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,900
greater than we show to the left.

1982
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,900
That is sort of what I was talking about.

1983
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,600
But again, I don't know how crazy will get with it.

1984
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,800
In terms of three dienes.

1985
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,700
I'm not sure if they were talking about.

1986
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,400
But again we let's wait till we get a little bit more into trying to

1987
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:06,800
play with that stuff before we talk about it more because we're not

1988
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,000
sure exactly what we're going to try.

1989
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:14,800
In early episodes.

1990
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:16,500
You worked on having multiple Z levels.

1991
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,900
Wouldn't this mean you would need to render walls in 3D?

1992
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:22,300
Thus introducing some 3D into the rendering and letting calculations

1993
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:27,100
possibly but I think I'll probably try to handle that again in slices.

1994
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,100
Like I don't know that we want to try and do full 3d for that.

1995
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:33,600
I think we might want to just have like, Lighting on two different

1996
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,900
planes or whatever, right?

1997
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:36,600
Or maybe just one plane, whatever.

1998
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:38,900
The plane you're on, has Lighting in the other ones, don't stuff like

1999
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:39,400
that.

2000
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,300
How often do you stream game development every night at 5 p.m.

2001
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:46,600
well, except weekends?

2002
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,100
My Lord.

2003
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:51,900
This a lot of questions.

2004
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:53,300
I think I might have to end the Q&A.

2005
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:57,000
Sir, my voice is getting tired and I want to have dinner.

2006
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:17,100
What is your background that led to where you are is education or

2007
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,400
important or interest more important?

2008
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,000
And we've covered that in earlier episodes, I'd probably recommend

2009
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,800
going back and watching earlier episodes to for more Exposition on

2010
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,200
that.

2011
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,700
Well, this lighting system work for blind people.

2012
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:33,300
So, the important thing for blind people write is, it's very much like

2013
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,100
deaf people.

2014
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:37,300
You want to just do it really loud, right?

2015
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,300
So, if you want the lighting system to work, well for blind people,

2016
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:43,900
you need to increase the brightness to a very high level so they can

2017
01:45:43,900 --> 01:45:44,200
see it.

2018
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,700
Obviously, I mean, right, that goes without saying, I'm telling you

2019
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:46,900
stuff.

2020
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:47,900
You already know but

2021
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,900
Do you think we'll be able to do all this in real time?

2022
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:53,900
Or we have to pre-bake some of the lighting information?

2023
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:58,400
When generating the map, don't know, I really don't it's all

2024
01:45:58,400 --> 01:45:59,600
conjecture at this point.

2025
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,100
Couldn't you just make a 3D game and then flatten it with a rolling

2026
01:46:15,100 --> 01:46:15,500
pin?

2027
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:16,900
That's not a bad idea.

2028
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:18,400
II.

2029
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,900
Do agree that, that, that would be an easy way to create 2D assets out

2030
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:25,800
of 3D assets, but I'm afraid they might smush out too much so that you

2031
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,200
have to figure out how to solve that problem.

2032
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,700
How often is Real Time radiosity used in games?

2033
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:33,700
Is it easy?

2034
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,000
And do you guys use it?

2035
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Why or why not?

2036
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,900
Well, so real-time radiosity I wouldn't use the term radiosity because

2037
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:44,100
radiosity is a specific technique, right?

2038
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:48,000
Radiosity is really not, you know.

2039
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
without going into too much detail, radiosity is a scheme that's about

2040
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,400
solving for the heat transfer between lighting space between surfaces

2041
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,300
right and

2042
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:08,200
If not really that common in games, I think maybe frostbite uses a

2043
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,900
licensed radiosity transfer engine maybe, but a lot of people just

2044
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,300
aren't using any of that stuff anymore.

2045
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:19,000
They do real-time lighting, but it's not radiosity, it's done in

2046
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:19,900
different ways.

2047
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:24,500
And so radiosity is a technique not in effect, right?

2048
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:30,400
And so I would, I would say that real-time lighting that does include

2049
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,900
indirect lighting, is now much more commonplace

2050
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:36,800
Like I said, unreal 4 has a lot of it in there.

2051
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,400
I believe they'll do they have?

2052
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,800
Like, I think they have a sparse voxel, octree stuff in there.

2053
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,200
Now for lighting where they actually do, like, you know, real time

2054
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:49,800
diffusion crytek has you know, a voxel light propagation scheme so

2055
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:54,300
that it's in many professional 3D engines now, but it's not

2056
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,500
necessarily radiosity.

2057
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,800
Radiosity is a very specific type of a technique.

2058
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,800
DGM TV.

2059
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,300
I saw a game that uses normal maps on Sprites.

2060
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:14,400
There are many games I want to say, there are many games that use

2061
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,200
normal maps on Sprites.

2062
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:19,000
It's still not actually that common like a lot of sprite games don't

2063
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,100
use normal Maps but it's definitely not super rare.

2064
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,500
Like there are plenty of games that have shipped with normal maps for

2065
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:27,000
Sprites.

2066
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:29,400
The question is usually, just how do you generate them, right?

2067
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,700
If you render your art assets from 3D down to 2D it's trivial.

2068
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,400
But if they're hand-painted, like ours are, it's a question of who.

2069
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,400
Hates them and how right?

2070
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:41,100
Isn't lights.

2071
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:44,000
Fall off inverse Square As you move farther from the light source,

2072
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:46,800
each Ray is further from its neighbors.

2073
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,500
So know your there's there's two separate things right and this is

2074
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:52,100
kind of crucial.

2075
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:53,800
Again, this is not a complete lighting course.

2076
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:58,600
So, you know, I don't go into detail about everything but the inverse

2077
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:02,900
Square law is actually only affects part of your light.

2078
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:06,800
So, let me, let me give you a little, I'll try to explain a little bit

2079
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,400
how that works.

2080
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:09,600
So basically remember I said there's the

2081
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,300
Direct indirect light, right?

2082
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,900
And so, if you think about how the light works, if I have incoming

2083
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,200
light and outgoing light.

2084
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:18,900
Like so,

2085
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,000
Then the inverse Square law.

2086
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,700
Really does not affect a single Photon path, coming from a light

2087
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:30,600
source and bouncing off, right?

2088
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:36,300
And so if I'm trying to figure out how bright are reflected lights,

2089
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:39,600
light source is in a mirror, there is no inverse Square law

2090
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,400
calculation.

2091
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:44,500
The only thing that affects that the inverse Square law affects is how

2092
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:48,000
big the light appears to be in the mirror.

2093
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,800
Does that make sense?

2094
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:54,000
So basically the inverse Square law, if I had a mirrored sphere, the

2095
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,100
only thing the inverse Square law says is as the light gets further

2096
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,300
away, it will be bigger or smaller like as as it gets further away,

2097
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:02,500
like here's if it's closed right?

2098
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,800
And here's how big it would be if it was far so the inverse Square

2099
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:06,100
law.

2100
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,100
That's what what happens there, right?

2101
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:12,900
And that's because again, the light obviously like you were saying, if

2102
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:16,300
I have a constant density of things that are showing out, you know,

2103
01:50:16,300 --> 01:50:18,600
along this, whatever the solid angle.

2104
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,400
Is right then the further away, I get the more spread out, those

2105
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:29,000
photons are going to be right, but for a given one, it doesn't matter.

2106
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:34,100
So the size of the light source projected onto the object, does fall

2107
01:50:34,100 --> 01:50:38,600
off with inverse Square law, but it's brightness, does not, okay.

2108
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:46,000
So, what that means is that, yes, you will have a inverse-square law

2109
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,800
affect in terms of how much light in total May reach an object based

2110
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,000
on how far away the light source is because the bouncing around from

2111
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,900
different angles will get more sparse as you get further away.

2112
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,800
But for the pure reflected part,

2113
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,700
It's actually just the size of the reflects that changes but the

2114
01:51:02,700 --> 01:51:06,800
brightness is intact and I know that's a little counterintuitive but

2115
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:07,800
that's just the truth.

2116
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:12,300
And so there is no inverse Square law for brightness.

2117
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,700
It's not really a thing.

2118
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,700
That's, I mean, I'm sorry I should say for the pure reflective part,

2119
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:23,000
that's more for the diffuse, bouncing around part, if anything right.

2120
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:41,300
Would you consider voxel izing the scene like LittleBigPlanet 2 does?

2121
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:44,900
Yeah, so I mean, honestly, that's what I was sort of talking about

2122
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:46,100
here, right?

2123
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:50,100
Literally, that is sort of what I was thinking in my head was that

2124
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:51,500
kind of a scheme, right?

2125
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:55,400
You put in the light sources, you defuse them and then you have like

2126
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:58,100
you you you know where your objects are.

2127
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:02,300
So you block you kind of remove the light from there like a voxel kind

2128
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:03,500
of scheme, right?

2129
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:06,000
Only we're not we're too deep because we don't you know so we don't

2130
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,100
have voxels per se.

2131
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,100
And so yeah, like to a large extent that is exactly the sort of thing

2132
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,200
like LittleBigPlanet style.

2133
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:14,100
Lighting is exactly the sort of thing I was thinking of

2134
01:52:24,700 --> 01:52:26,800
Let's just see if there's any more good questions here.

2135
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,000
There's probably, there's just so many questions.

2136
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,800
I'm not going to get to the mall, so I'm just going to see if there's

2137
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,200
any other ones that like, I really think we should answer.

2138
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,800
Had to log in so hopefully this isn't too late.

2139
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:52,900
Wouldn't there be fall off with a point source when integrating across

2140
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:55,300
the surface since the Rays spread out away from the source?

2141
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:56,700
Okay, so I think we just covered that.

2142
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,900
And so the answer is that's that is for ambient lighting terms.

2143
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,000
As for the indirect, lighting terms will do that.

2144
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:08,000
But not the direct lighting terms and it's a common misconception to

2145
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:08,800
about that, right?

2146
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,600
Like how that works.

2147
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:11,500
Exactly is the inverse Square law.

2148
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,500
Doesn't affect light along a line, light is constant along the line.

2149
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:19,600
So, only, once you start talking about areas, do you care about that?

2150
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:23,300
So it depends on which part of the reflectance, you're trying to

2151
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:28,600
compute whether or not the inverse Square law, affects the size of it

2152
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,100
or the brightness of it, right?

2153
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:37,200
And so yeah, you can't just say that light falls off with inverse

2154
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:39,100
Square law because that's not actually true.

2155
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:42,100
The brightness of light is constant along a ray.

2156
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,700
It's about what the the actual effect is that's happening.

2157
01:53:47,700 --> 01:53:52,600
On the other side, whether the spread of those Rays, end up causing a

2158
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:57,100
diminishing brightness effect, which is the case for purely scattered

2159
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:59,800
light or a smaller size.

2160
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,200
Which is the case.

2161
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,700
With a reflectance.

2162
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:40,300
Why is it easier to represent light as photons and not particles in 3D

2163
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,300
programs?

2164
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:53,600
I don't think it is like, you're not first of all photons are kind of

2165
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,500
particles, right?

2166
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I'm sorry, I don't think I understand the question.

2167
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,200
I guess I'll say about that one.

2168
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:13,300
Rendering light in environments and events, approaching the speed of

2169
01:55:13,300 --> 01:55:13,700
light.

2170
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,700
How to do it?

2171
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:15,800
Haha, I don't know.

2172
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,600
Good luck to you.

2173
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,200
I'm sure that's a whole relative.

2174
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:21,300
That that sounds like something, Mark ten Bosch would do.

2175
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,400
PBR lightning.

2176
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,200
I don't know what PBR lightning is, quick rundown on how it works.

2177
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:32,600
I'm afraid.

2178
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,500
I cannot give you an hour or so.

2179
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:36,100
I don't even know what PBR lightning is.

2180
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,500
You mean like lightning from the sky lightning?

2181
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:40,500
I'm not sure.

2182
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,000
All right, think we've come to the end.

2183
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:49,800
We have come to the end but I understand that John is streaming.

2184
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:53,000
Now, some people are saying that John streaming so if you want to

2185
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:58,300
watch some more stuff right now, you should go check out his stream.

2186
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,300
Naysayer 88 on Twitch.

2187
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:04,300
I may well be going to check out history as well.

2188
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:05,800
So yeah.

2189
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:09,400
Alright let's go ahead and wrap this up tomorrow.

2190
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,400
We will start working probably with normal maps that

2191
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,200
Be the first part of the stuff that we do.

2192
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,000
So, I hope to see you back here tomorrow.

2193
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:19,800
5:00 p.m.

2194
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:25,100
right here, same time, same place on Twitch, it's been a crazy q a

2195
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:25,600
day.

2196
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:26,600
I don't know what happened there.

2197
01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:29,300
Maybe we're on the twitch FrontPage again, or something like that, but

2198
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:31,200
glad to see new people ask questions in there.

2199
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,000
A lot of good questions to, which is pretty awesome.

2200
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:36,400
Again, thank you for joining me for an episode of handmade hero.

2201
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,900
It's been a pleasure coding with you, as always, I will.

2202
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:41,000
I will.

2203
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,400
Hopefully see you

2204
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:45,200
Guys, again, tomorrow, or on John stream, after this?

2205
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:49,100
In the meantime, if you would like to preorder the game to get the

2206
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:51,700
source code, you can do that on handmade hero dot-org and it comes to

2207
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:52,000
the source.

2208
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,200
So you can play around with the techniques that we're talking about

2209
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,600
here on the stream and see how they work.

2210
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,600
You can also subscribe to our patreon if you want to support the video

2211
01:56:58,600 --> 01:56:59,800
series, it's always about you.

2212
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,300
Shadid we also have forums we can ask questions and there's also ports

2213
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:07,000

2214
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,300
stuff and anti depa, sewed, guides all good stuff.

2215
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:11,800
So I highly recommend checking that out and if you want to be able to

2216
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:14,100
catch the stream live, we have a tweet, but you can subscribe to that

If you're trying to catch us live, it's the best way to stay
