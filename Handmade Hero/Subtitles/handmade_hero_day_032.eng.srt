1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Of All Times.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,100
There we go.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
And then we'll get this party started here.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,700
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero day.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,000
32 of the show where we create an entire game from scratch using

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,500
absolutely nothing but our own bear typing fingers.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,500
So far.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,700
We have basically created a win32 platform layer and we are in the

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,900
midst of Designing our engine architecture.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,300
We're doing that by writing some exploratory, code on how we want to

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,900
create sort of our tilemap.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,600
Delayed system.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,700
And then we're going to be dealing with how we want to kind of do

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
animations and rendering in that sort of stuff.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,900
So we're kind of an exploratory phase right now, and we've got a bunch

16
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,600
of stuff to do.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,700
So, I'm going to try and dive into that relatively quickly.

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,000
But first, let me say the obligatory, if you pre-ordered the game and

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
are trying to follow along at home with the source code.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,100
You will note that today is today 32.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,600
So you want to unzip day, 31 source, code out of that giant zip file,

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,900
that has all the days in it.

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,800
So go ahead and unzip day, 31, and then you will have the source code

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
that is exactly the same.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Let's go that I have and then starting with now.

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,300
Now, if you're anything like me, then basically you thought last

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,500
night's stream was absolutely unproductive and Meandering.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,600
I was basically talking about all the stuff that we had to do and I

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,100
did not actually really get to do anything and I don't know about you

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,600
guys, but that always kind of leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,500
And so hopefully tonight we will be able to actually do some of the

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,000
stuff that we were talking about so we won't have to go to bed feeling

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
like a loser.

34
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,500
ER, because that's never fun as you know, anyway.

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's take a look at what we were doing.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Essentially we had gotten to the point on Friday, actually, where I

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,700
was sort of exploring how to do these tilemap things, and we ended up

38
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,400
in a place where we had this sort of concept of a canonical position

39
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,100
that a tile Map X and a Tom app, why that looked up into a set of tile

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
maps and then a tile X and a tile.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,100
Why?

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,800
That we're tile like the tile indices inside those tile maps.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,400
And then finally there was a relative offset and what I was thinking

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,000
over the

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,000
And then what I explained yesterday was that, really?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,400
This is kind of just too much work.

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
There's really no need for both of these because we don't need 64 bits

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
of tile addressing here.

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,000
Like we've got really what we could do is use a single 32-bit integer

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,600
to store the tile X and Tau Y.

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,400
And just assume that the tilemap part is some portion of that integer,

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,900
the High bits of that integer.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,300
And so, what I really wanted to do is I really wanted to turn these,

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,600
you know, both of those sort of into this sort of thing where they

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,000
were.

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,200
So, instead of having all of these, I wanted to get rid of these guys

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,100
up here and I wanted to switch to just using one unsigned version for

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,300
both the tile X on the tile Y and then this relative stuff would just

59
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,000
be relative to whatever the tile was.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
Now, I'm not 100% sure about this.

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm pretty sure about this part.

62
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,300
Although there are some some trade-offs, but I'm not sure about what

63
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,800
these should be real.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,100
You summon someone on the stream.

65
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,000
Yesterday actually was talking about the fact that could we make them

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,900
relative to the tile Pages themselves.

67
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,500
The things that are sort of going to store the tiles in them in chunks

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and I think there could be good reasons why we might want to do that.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,800
However, I don't really know offhand.

70
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,300
What the right thing to do here is and so I'm going to proceed

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,700
assuming that these are relative to the tile and we'll just kind of go

72
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,100
from there.

73
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,700
And if it turns out that as we kind of get a little further that it

74
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,700
looks like maybe it would be smarter to make them relative to the tile

75
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,300
page then we will.

76
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,200
And again that's exactly why we're doing this code.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,000
We're trying to explore and see what the right design decisions are

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,100
rather than making a bunch of design, decisions up front and then

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,600
finding out that they're wrong later.

80
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,000
So we're trying to go, you know, sort of a nice.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Low build from the ground up kind of approach.

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,800
That makes everything work properly instead of a sort of make

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
decisions and then Implement a ton of stuff and then only later find

84
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
out that it's busted.

85
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,400
So, what I want to do is I want to drive towards this because I just

86
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
felt this was a little too excessive.

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,200
But of course, we have to kind of figure out how we would actually

88
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
make this work.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,600
Now if we go back and look, in fact, I can sort of, I can sort of say,

90
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,000
you know, make these into something here, that won't compile it all.

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,700
You can sort of see that we've got lots of places, right?

92
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Where we are using these

93
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,100
There's just tons and tons and tons and tons of places that were, you

94
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,700
know, sort of rely on this stuff because we wrote the code necessary

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,200
to sort of, do all the tile map positioning and stuff.

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,400
So, what we would like to do essentially is sort of see what how we if

97
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,200
we can sort of move that code over into something that would that

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,900
would be working with a new way of doing things where you're always

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,600
talking about these canonical positions.

100
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,500
Now what I want to point out here, this is the first time we've kind

101
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,800
of done.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,900
This is this is a uh,

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Large step.

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,800
So, typically when you're doing architecture work like this, you've

105
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,200
got small steps and you've got large steps and most of the steps that

106
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,600
we did before.

107
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
We're like compression steps.

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,900
They were they were small steps of like taking something that worked

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,000
and just sort of making, you know, pulling out some common code and

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
reusing it right?

111
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,500
But what we're doing here is we're reconsidering one of the ways to do

112
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
something because we think we found a more efficient way.

113
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,000
And so this is a little bit of a larger step in the code base, right?

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,900
It's, it's very much sort of a lateral movement rather than

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,100
In something where we're just kind of going to do a trivial pull out

116
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,700
of something.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,600
And so this is a little bit of a larger step and they are a little bit

118
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,800
harder to make, but you shouldn't be afraid of making them.

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,500
That's why we made this code, really simple, really flexible, really

120
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,100
easy and basic is because we want to have the freedom to change it

121
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,300
around like this, and we don't want a lot of stuff baked in, so it's

122
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,000
okay.

123
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,100
And we haven't spent a lot of time to bugging things.

124
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,400
We haven't spent a lot of time optimizing anything.

125
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
So it's okay to go in and delete some of that code, because

126
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,400
This was just code to play around with and that's okay.

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,500
And what you would ideally like to do as much as possible is always

128
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,800
try to.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Make as many large moves as you can when the code is sort of like

130
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,700
early.

131
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,200
And that not that much time has been spent on it because then you're

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,900
not losing that much work.

133
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,400
So that's that's this is exactly the kind of time when we want to make

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,700
these kind of moves, okay?

135
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,800
So, if I take a look here at the stuff that we've gotten, we have that

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
get canonical position thing, right?

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And the thing about get canonical position, was that essentially we

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,800
were using it in a lot of places because we had backed ourselves into

139
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,300
a corner using pixels for everything.

140
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,700
Right?

141
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,900
We're constantly in this this sort of situation where we have a, we

142
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,000
have just pixels coming in and like for the player.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,500
For example, if we look at out at how we restoring the player,

144
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,100
We are constantly having this problem of storing, like okay, there's a

145
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,600
tile Map X and a Tom app, Y and then there's the offset relative, the

146
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,100
tile map and all that sort of stuff.

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,400
But if we were to actually sort of move, if you know, could we sort of

148
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,100
start to trim out this code by just moving to storing these canonical

149
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,200
positions directly, right?

150
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,300
And so one question that I have maybe right off the bat is, could I do

151
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,500
that step first without actually changing to the 32-bit thing.

152
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,900
Could I maybe do that step first as an easy?

153
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,400
Step towards moving towards the 32-bit thing, like move, everything

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,000
over to using the canonical positions first.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
So what would happen if I did that?

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,000
What would happen if I went in here and said, all right.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,100
And as you can see, we have it to do here that I even said, could this

158
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,300
be using canonical position?

159
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,400
So, if I have canonical position, that's just, you know, player key or

160
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,500
something, you know, where's the player, right?

161
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,800
If I have that?

162
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
What would I do here?

163
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
What could I do?

164
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,000
What would the code look like?

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,900
If it always was working with that instead.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So instead of initializing.

167
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,300
In the player X in the player.

168
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,100
Why directly?

169
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,600
Now, we've got a player P and it's one of these canonical positions.

170
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,200
So the canonical position has it at the tile Map X.

171
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,800
We know that's just going to, we were just starting him off on that

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,100
initial.

173
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,700
Tilemap that one up in the corner, right?

174
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,500
So Tom maps, map X tilemap.

175
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,900
Why?

176
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,700
And and then the the tile X and the tile, why?

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,000
We're in here as well.

178
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,900
Is this?

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,700
So the tie relative exito who we were, or we had already done it so

180
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,500
that it was relative to the corner of the tile.

181
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,900
I guess.

182
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
So, that's kind of handy.

183
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,500
So, basically, what we can say there is all right.

184
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,000
The tile relative X, you know, is maybe something something sort of

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,600
trivial.

186
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:26,900
I don't know.

187
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,300
Just, let's, we'll talk about that.

188
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,000
And in one second later since we haven't really touched that much, but

189
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,500
let's say that this is, I don't know it's five because this is all

190
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,200
still in pixels.

191
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,600
We haven't actually fixed fix things.

192
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,000
Yet, remember I talked yesterday about wine?

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Fixing the not be in pixels.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
We haven't actually done that yet.

195
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,200
All right, so, you know, maybe we set it to the tile X and Tau Y is 3

196
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,500
3.

197
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,200
I don't actually know what's in 33.

198
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's see.

199
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,900
That's 0 0, that's 1 1, that's 2 to that's 33.

200
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Well, it should be open.

201
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
So that seems like a reasonable place to stick our player down for

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,300
now.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,300
So I'm going to go ahead and compile that and that should initialized

204
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,900
properly, I think.

205
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
So then when we do the get tilemap, now, we're just talking about

206
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
player p.

207
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Tilemap x and player P.

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,000
Tilemap.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,300
Why?

210
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,500
In battle get the tile map out of the world and let's see what else

211
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,300
we've got here.

212
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,800
This is basically just adding.

213
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah.

214
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,800
So this is fine.

215
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
This is saying player X is not a member of game State.

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,400
That's fine because we now have the tile relative X and the tile

217
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,900
relative.

218
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,400
Why of the player we can add the

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,100
T.

220
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,900
So basically we have this motion Vector that before we were adding to

221
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,500
just the players offset from the corner of a tile map.

222
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,600
Now, we're just going to add it to the offset of them in the tile,

223
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,000
right?

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,900
That's all we're going to do.

225
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
And now we don't have to create raw positions anymore because we just

226
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,700
we already have a canonical position.

227
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,700
Right?

228
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,600
And what we can do is say, Okay, so the canonical position that's

229
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,100
going to be player left, for example is going to be equal to game

230
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,400
State player P and similarly the tile relative X.

231
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,400
There we go.

232
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
The tile relative there as well.

233
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,100
So, basically, all I'm doing is converting everything over to using

234
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,200
those canonical positions.

235
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,500
Right now.

236
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,400
I've got the game State player P there as well.

237
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,300
So now, I basically construct a canonical positions.

238
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,300
But of course, they're not really all that canonical at this point

239
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,400
because the player left, and the player right in and the player

240
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,800
position for that matter.

241
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,100
Have had basically movement done to them.

242
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,600
So their tile relative X in there Tower relative.

243
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
Why we may now be outside the

244
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,400
boundaries of the tile that they should have been on, right?

245
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,700
And so I've got two ways that I could handle.

246
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,100
That one is that I could call a function that re canonicalize has

247
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,300
them, right?

248
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,700
And the other is, I could go ahead and just make a function that does

249
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,500
the Delta.

250
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,400
So that from then, on basically, instead of just cold adding stuff to

251
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,800
it.

252
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,500
I could go ahead and do these as by calling function.

253
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,200
That would automatically re canonicalize.

254
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,100
I think I probably want both of them if that makes sense.

255
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,800
So I'm going to

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,900
Start with the re canonicalized one.

257
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,900
So the so basically get canonical position.

258
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,300
This guy here, the get canonical position.

259
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,900
I think that will basically become that will basically come a function

260
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
that just re canonicalize has things.

261
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,200
Because since everything will now be in canonical positions.

262
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
We don't really need to pass a raw position anymore.

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,400
We can just pass a canonical position and the whole job of this

264
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,900
function will basically just be to turn a canonical position to turn

265
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,800
something that's been

266
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,800
When mutated that's had its relative X relative.

267
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Why messed with it?

268
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
Will basically turn it into something that's canonical again, right?

269
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,600
So just to make clear what I'm doing here is, we're storing stuff

270
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,300
right now.

271
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,500
We're storing it to the corner.

272
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,200
I think, I want to change the story it to the center.

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
But that's a separate issue.

274
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,700
Again.

275
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,300
Just things that things that I think about.

276
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,300
As I'm going through, we're storing things on a tile.

277
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,400
This is an individual tile, not a tile map tile map is you know is

278
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
there's tiles, you know, tiles tiles tiles.

279
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
We have my particular.

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Thailand.

281
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
We say that the player is on this tile, we are storing their relative

282
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,300
position based on where the corner is and based on what I'm saying

283
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,400
here is, well, if we mutate that at all, if we change, if we make

284
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,100
additions, or subtractions to that offset from the upper corner of the

285
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,800
tile, if we offset it too much, like we offset it.

286
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,000
So that it's in pointing all the way out here.

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,400
Or if it's pointing back here, or if it was up here right now, the

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
tile X and tile.

289
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
Why for that canonical position are wrong, right?

290
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,600
So what we want to be able to do is say, okay.

291
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,900
We'd like,

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,100
Like to be able to make a just a random adjustment to this to this

293
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,500
vector.

294
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,000
And then say, hey, could you now re canonicalize it, make it back into

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,700
a proper chemical position where the tile X and Y, actually reflect

296
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,300
the tile X and Y, that you're in, and the tile relative X and Y are

297
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,000
going to be less than the boundary of one tile, right?

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So I just need a function that's going to do that before.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,800
What we were doing is we're calling a raw position, something that had

300
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,500
mechanical as yet.

301
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,700
I just want to always work with these canonical positions.

302
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,300
And then, in fact, we can even get rid of the name canonical, we can

303
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,400
just call the world positions.

304
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,900
So we're just

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,100
How to move towards that state Again by again, we're just trying to

306
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,300
slowly sort of work our way up to something that we think is, is right

307
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,900
and good.

308
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,900
So what I want to do here is say all right.

309
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,500
I've got the tile Map X, tilemap, why?

310
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,800
Those are going to copy across.

311
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,300
In fact, what I can do is just say the result equals the pose

312
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,000
immediately.

313
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,900
I don't have to do this flooring anymore essentially because I can, I

314
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
can sort of take a look at.

315
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,300
Well, I will want to do a flooring of some kind, just not.

316
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
Not anything like this.

317
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,400
So what I want to do here is I want to say, okay.

318
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,500
In fact, this is kind of neat.

319
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Let me talk about this for a second.

320
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,200
To, you'll notice that in here.

321
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,700
We had baked in the world upper left in the world, upper the upper

322
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,500
left X in the upper left.

323
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,700
Y.

324
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,100
And that was because we were trying to turn pixel locations back into

325
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
World locations by storing everything such that they're in World

326
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,600
locations in the first place right by storing the player relative to a

327
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,200
tile.

328
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,800
We no longer have to worry about what the offset was on the screen.

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,800
And so, we're almost in doing this mutation that we're doing to the

330
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
code right now and doing this, this

331
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,900
Step.

332
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,700
We're actually getting for free.

333
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,600
Something that we were saying we had to do, which is start to get away

334
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,200
from pixels.

335
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,600
We're already taking one step towards that, so it's kind of another

336
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
sign that we're on the right track, right?

337
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,600
When these things start to fall out.

338
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
So the fact that we're getting rid of that entirely is pretty good

339
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,100
there, right?

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,300
So basically do they

341
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Okay.

342
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,900
So basically what we can look at here is we can sort of start to say.

343
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
All right, what?

344
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,000
Actually is the problem with a canonical position that has become

345
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,500
uncanonical eyes, right?

346
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,200
The rail, X and the rail, why will not be within a tile boundary base

347
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,600
plate.

348
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,400
So if I say pose tile relex, I get, I know in my world definition

349
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,900
here.

350
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,700
I essentially have a tile size in pixels, right?

351
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
And that tile size and

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Whistles.

353
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm basically saying that my tile relative EX.

354
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,400
For my guy should be between 0 and tile side and pixels.

355
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,700
If it's not, then I need to make sure that it is.

356
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,300
And I need to basically break it up into whatever the part that would

357
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,100
have been within the boundary and then some offset to the tile X and

358
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,900
the tile why to move the actual index of the tiles.

359
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,000
Again, this is just saying we have a tile ex-anti.

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Wow, that tells us which Tower in.

361
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
So if we are, you know, less than zero or if we are greater than one

362
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,200
tile.

363
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,600
We have to start moving the tile X or the tile y in the direction, you

364
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,200
know, however many steps it would need to to make it so that we're on

365
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,100
the right tile again.

366
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,700
So in order to do that, basically what I want to do is I want to take

367
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,200
I want to take the tile, the, the tile relative X for the position and

368
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,800
I want to divide it by the tile side in pixels, right?

369
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,500
That would tell me if that number is a number between 0 and 1, then

370
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,300
we're all good.

371
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,300
Then we know that we haven't gone more than one tile in a direction.

372
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,100
If that number is less than 0, right?

373
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,500
Then that would mean that I have gone, you know, back out the the,

374
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
the, the back of the tile and if

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,500
That tile was greater than 1.

376
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,100
Then that means that I went too far outside the tile in the positive

377
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,600
direction, right?

378
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
So those are the two cases for me exiting outside of the tile.

379
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,000
So what I'd like to do is figure out how many tiles I went, right?

380
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,500
So basically I can say here.

381
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,000
All right, let's let's take this.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,900
This post.

383
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,300
I'll relics and there's a couple things.

384
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't want to spend too much time thinking about this because again,

385
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
we're going to make two more mutations here.

386
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,500
First of all, we're going to move out of pixels and then I might want

387
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,800
to change like I said to Center relative addressing so I'm just going

388
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
to go ahead and make this one mutation.

389
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,500
Ation here.

390
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,200
I'm going to make it in as dumb away as possible basically.

391
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,900
And I think the way that I want to do that is, I essentially want to

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,400
make a function that's going to do the canonicalization, sort of, in,

393
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,599
for one coordinate system because they're sort of separate, right?

394
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,599
So I want to do like canonicalize coordinate, right?

395
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,400
And I'm going to pass it, the pose.

396
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,300
Where is my canonical post here?

397
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,500
I'm going to pass it.

398
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,800
The the tile.

399
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,700
Where are we here?

400
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm going to pass it.

401
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,900
The tile X and the tile.

402
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,300
Why?

403
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Right?

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, this is yeah, you know what?

405
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,100
This is going to be unfortunate to.

406
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,200
I wonder if we should just try to make these two steps together foof.

407
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,100
It's rough.

408
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,600
But if you think about it, I don't really feel like doing that whole

409
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,400
tilemap X thing either, right?

410
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,000
Because that's going to be a whole thing.

411
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,100
That's

412
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:47,700
To go away.

413
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,300
It's basically writing a bunch of code that we don't have to write

414
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,800
just to stay working with this thing in.

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,300
Well, you know, I'm going to stick with the plan.

416
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,200
I'll do it.

417
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
I'll do it the way that I said I was going to do it first.

418
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,600
And we'll just we'll go from there.

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,200
All right, so I'm going to pass it.

420
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Basically these these fourth, the world and the three exes.

421
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,800
And then I'm going to have one that does the same thing with the three

422
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,100
wise, right?

423
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,700
And then I've got my canonic last chord here, which is essentially

424
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,700
going to do whatever it needs to do for that.

425
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,700
And so I think that means that I'm not gonna be able to get rid of as

426
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,200
much of the stuff.

427
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,900
I won't have to use this one, but I'm going to have to essentially

428
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,400
keep a lot of the stuff here that we had.

429
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,300
Unfortunately.

430
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,000
Let's see.

431
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,800
So

432
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,800
And this stuff again, we don't have to worry too much about this, I

433
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,800
guess because again, we're replacing it all.

434
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
But yeah, just looking at it here.

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,400
It's like, wow, what a mess.

436
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
What a mess people.

437
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,400
This is exactly why I say, we want to keep working on this because

438
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,000
it's just, there's just too much work being done for not enough pay

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,400
off.

440
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,100
And so it'll be kind of nice to get to the point where that's no

441
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,800
longer the case.

442
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,400
All right.

443
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Anyway, so we're economically as the position.

444
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,300
We basically need to re canonicalize those coordinates.

445
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Let's go ahead and make that beer.

446
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,900
Economically has coordinates.

447
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,800
They don't take anything and let's go ahead and grab out what this

448
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,300
takes.

449
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,900
So it takes a pointer to the world.

450
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,300
It takes a pointer to the tile Map X.

451
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
So that's a 32.

452
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,700
It takes a pointer to the tile X.

453
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
And again, it's taking pointers just because I need to modify them.

454
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,900
Right?

455
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,800
So it needs a pointer to the actual one so I can modify it.

456
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
That's all that's happening there.

457
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,400
Nothing.

458
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Particularly, nothing particularly fancy.

459
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm still going to work with them just as regular but

460
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Okay.

461
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,400
Well, so if we're still doing it that way and we're doing the re

462
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
canonicalization, then basically, I'm going to have to stick with the

463
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,000
same algorithm.

464
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,800
We were doing before.

465
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,500
Just in terms of getting things working.

466
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,000
Thankfully we can get rid of the x's and y's part of thing here.

467
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:05,200
And instead, I can just go just using the, the tile map the tile and

468
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,900
the relative, right?

469
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Okay.

470
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,100
So again, this is going to be basically the same all of this stuff

471
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,100
should be roughly the same, except I got to have to pass the World

472
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,300
Council.

473
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,000
As well.

474
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,500
So let's take a look here because I don't actually know which one it

475
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:19,900
will be.

476
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,500
Right.

477
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Yeah, you can see.

478
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah, you can totally see that, right?

479
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,700
Because I've got the world count, X.

480
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,500
We're allowed to have different context.

481
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,000
And can't why?

482
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,400
That's another thing that we'll be able to fix is having our tile Maps

483
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,000
be square.

484
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Even though this the way that we're visit viewing them isn't which

485
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,100
again, will be kind of nice.

486
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Alright, so we also have to have the count, the the the tile count

487
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,300
basically.

488
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,900
And that's going to have to go in here.

489
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
Okay, so

490
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,500
There we go.

491
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:59,700
When I get rid of all of this stuff, we should basically be able to

492
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,900
Yeah, we should be able to get this down to something simpler and then

493
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:14,300
hopefully yeah, hopefully this will set us up for doing much nicer

494
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,500
stuff than what we were doing.

495
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
But yeah, perhaps it's a little too early to tell.

496
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,500
All right.

497
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,200
So now we want to keep our assertions in here.

498
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,400
That's totally fine.

499
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,400
These are the tile relative want to basically assert that.

500
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
The thing the the offset is going to still be in range.

501
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,300
At the end of the day, the tile, it was there.

502
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:41,400
So we've got the tile times the world side and pixels, got the X.

503
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,100
And so now we just have to kind of reconstruct these things here,

504
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
which are going to, which is going to be kind of annoying.

505
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,700
All right?

506
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,900
Okay, so I've kind of massage everything out.

507
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,900
All right, so we still have our floor in here that we're doing and we

508
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,500
have the X.

509
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
So this is flooring US based on where we are on the town map, which is

510
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,200
not going to be

511
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,000
Be particularly useful.

512
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:08,000
What we would rather do is just take a look at flooring, the tile rail

513
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,100
itself.

514
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,500
Right?

515
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,800
What we want to do is floor the tile rail itself.

516
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,700
So, basically, we're going to divide, like I was saying before by the

517
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
tile side and pixels.

518
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,900
We're going to floor of the tower a land that were.

519
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Tell us how far essentially we have gone past where our tile X was

520
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,600
before.

521
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,200
And so essentially this is going to be it's not going to beat Alex.

522
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,100
This is going to be our X.

523
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,300
Offset essentially or our our, our overflow underflow.

524
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
If you will from where the tile should be, whatever that floor is

525
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,300
because basically if that floor, you know, 01234.

526
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,600
However much it is that's how far off.

527
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,200
That's how far from our Bay style.

528
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,100
We ended up being due to our tile relative offset.

529
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,700
Okay.

530
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
So all we really need to do then.

531
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,100
At that point, is we need to go ahead, It's gotta change.

532
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Those, we need to go ahead and take whatever that offset is and we

533
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,700
need to add that in here.

534
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Right?

535
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,300
So, whatever the offset is, we're going to offset our tile index by

536
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,700
that offset, right?

537
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,100
And then what we need to do is we need to figure out essentially,

538
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,800
Whatever It, Whatever the remainder was.

539
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,300
And we can do that again, they'll be faster ways for us to do this in

540
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,000
the future obviously, but yeah, we can do that again by basically

541
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,300
saying, okay, whatever the tile relative thing was, it's essentially

542
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,100
going to be, we're going to subtract out of

543
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
The tile relative that we had.

544
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,200
We're going to subtract out whatever the base of the tile actually

545
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,100
was, right.

546
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,000
And you can see sort of how I'm doing that here.

547
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Don't let this fool you, right.

548
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,000
That is just referencing the tile that we're on.

549
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,100
And so all we're trying to do here is say, all right, we have a tile

550
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,300
relative position.

551
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,300
We hope that it is between 0 and the tile sided pixels, but we know

552
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,200
that we may have offset it so that it's outside of that range.

553
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,700
We want to do the floor.

554
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,800
So we know essentially

555
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
A number - 1 - 2 1 2 3 however, far in tiles.

556
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
We have to go that that offset, whatever, however much that offset

557
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,300
implies that we would have to go to get to the, to the right tile.

558
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,400
We're to compute that offset, add it to our tile index.

559
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,800
So, that now we're on the right tile, but now we have to reset our

560
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,000
tile relative offset so that our tile relative offset is within the

561
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
new tile that we were on.

562
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,700
And in order to do that.

563
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,200
I just want to subtract away, right?

564
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,800
Whatever the

565
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,400
The.

566
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, well, I can't quite do that.

567
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
It's actually the offset.

568
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,000
That's wrong.

569
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,200
That's wrong.

570
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,300
Whatever.

571
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,500
The offset amount was that we computed.

572
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,600
We want to get rid of that from the tile from the towel relative

573
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,300
position, right?

574
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,500
Because we are already accounted for that by moving.

575
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,000
We move that many tiles over so we can subtract a way that many tiles

576
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,900
worth of pixels.

577
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,800
Right?

578
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,900
As I'm explaining all of that again, like hopefully don't have too

579
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,600
many bugs in their.

580
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,700
This is one of those routines that I wish I could concentrate on

581
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,900
complete.

582
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,600
It's just over the level of where you should be talking when you're

583
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,300
doing it.

584
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
But yeah, what you gonna do?

585
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,800
That's just how handmade hero goes.

586
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,400
I gotta explain it or there's no point in doing this.

587
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,500
Okay.

588
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,200
So reconnect last chords, right?

589
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
I've got a pass the tile count X here in the top count.

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,300
Why?

591
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,400
Like I said before oops, it's not what it is.

592
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,000
It's like count, count X and count wire or something like this, right?

593
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,800
Tilemap.

594
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Count X.

595
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,000
There we go.

596
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,900
Tile map.

597
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,100
App can taste I almost there we go.

598
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,100
And so get canonical position.

599
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,500
So is world's Point empty is now just going to take a canonical

600
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,100
position.

601
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,900
Right?

602
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,400
And so it won't ever have to actually call that it'll just say Israel

603
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,900
Point empty.

604
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,200
It'll pass the position.

605
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,600
The position will just work at that point because it's already in can

606
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,200
pose.

607
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,600
So that's just fine.

608
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,400
We just eliminate that entirely and in fact, we can just eliminate raw

609
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,900
position entirely good.

610
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,700
So let's keep going here.

611
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,300
We know that we have to re canonicalize all of our positions now

612
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,200
because the game State player pee, right is is going to have to be re

613
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,100
canonicalized.

614
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,600
As are these guys player left equals R economically efficient.

615
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,900
And you can see why I say, you know, I mentioned earlier I was like, I

616
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,400
think I'm going to want both functions.

617
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,700
You can see this kind of annoying you have to remember to do this re

618
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,500
canonicalize after you do these offsets.

619
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,300
So what I'm saying is

620
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,300
Better if we just make a function that does the offset and does the

621
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,200
reconnect lies for you.

622
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,800
So we know we can just call that and it does the right thing.

623
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
So and I could put it to do in there as well.

624
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,200
To do Delta function that auto re canonicalize has

625
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,800
Okay, and we'll see that in a second.

626
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,000
But what do we do, re canonical position?

627
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,800
Did I actually say re canonical?

628
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,700
Re canonical position.

629
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,100
That's that's not, that's not English.

630
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
What is going on here?

631
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,500
It should be be canonicalize position, right?

632
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,100
Although that's not really probably English either re canonical

633
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,800
position.

634
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,100
It canonicalize position.

635
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,700
All right.

636
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,900
All right function does not take, is that really true?

637
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Is that really true takes a world and a position?

638
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,400
Okay.

639
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,800
Takes a world.

640
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Which I have and a physician.

641
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There we go.

642
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And there we go.

643
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,300
Player pose Undeclared identifier.

644
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Well, if it's an Undeclared identifier that I guess I will have to

645
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,200
agree with compiler.

646
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,600
It is true.

647
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,400
It was player pose.

648
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
So we don't have to do this again.

649
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,900
In fact, this is already essentially all done for us.

650
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,400
No, duh.

651
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,700
Okay, and this is actually, we don't actually need to do this the way

652
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,900
we were doing it here, either, right?

653
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,000
Because we want to do canonical position.

654
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,800
We're doing a test for the session.

655
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,800
So this is a new player P and that just equals game State player P.

656
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,400
So we're going to do that in a test position first.

657
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Right.

658
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,100
And that's just tile rail X, plus equals.

659
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,700
And this is a new player P towel rail, y plus Z equals, and that's

660
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,100
what we're doing our offset there.

661
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,200
And then we recant canonicalize, the new player P.

662
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,600
That's what we wanted.

663
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,800
And so then if we can actually go there, we don't have to do any of

664
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,600
this anymore.

665
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,500
Now, we can just say, all right, let's go ahead and set the game State

666
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,800
player P equal to the new player piece.

667
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,100
So we're basically going to accept the move there and that's already

668
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,900
getting a little cleaner.

669
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,200
It's not nearly as clean as

670
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,000
We wanted to be.

671
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,900
So we're, you know, we've got a ways to go.

672
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,100
I've listed many things, we have to do now, but, you know, we're

673
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,300
getting there again.

674
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Lots of baby steps.

675
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,900
Great programs, get written by lots of baby steps.

676
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,200
That's just the way it goes.

677
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,500
Sometimes make a big step.

678
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
Sometimes baby steps.

679
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,000
Usually it's a lot of baby steps.

680
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,400
All right, so game state.

681
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
So now we just have to figure out where the player is.

682
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,500
And that's should be relatively straightforward for right.

683
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:15,700
Now.

684
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,900
We can assume he's on the screen that were actually looking at,

685
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,800
because we always view that screen.

686
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,800
So all we really have to do is move him by the tile amount, right?

687
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,100
That is in the game, State player pee, right?

688
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
So there's the tile relative offset.

689
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,300
There's the tile rail X of the guy and the tile rail, why of the guy?

690
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,700
So we want to add that in there.

691
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,000
We then want to, we have the Taro test.

692
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,100
We now need to know his his tile ex and his tile.

693
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,300
Why.

694
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,600
And those need to get added in but they need to get added in with a

695
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,400
couple things in mind.

696
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,200
We need to know the offset of the world, right?

697
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,600
The upper.

698
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,300
An upper upper left X in the upper left y of the world because that's

699
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,200
the basis of the coordinate system for drawing.

700
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,000
That's where the tile start for the Tom at that's on the screen.

701
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,900
Then we need to add the game State.

702
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,200
You can see why I say they're so.

703
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,100
So long to go right?

704
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,500
Because this this will all you will see how clean this ends up being

705
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
but along the way things can get pretty messy.

706
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,700
It's true anyway,

707
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,700
Yeah, of course.

708
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,300
I'm saying that from kind of knowing what things should look like.

709
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,000
I guess it's kind of a little bit Grim if you've never programmed

710
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,600
before and you're going to lift up and going, oh my god, when, will it

711
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
ever be clean?

712
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
Or how can I possibly manage all this stuff?

713
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
But don't worry, you always can get there.

714
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,700
You just have to not give up.

715
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,600
Hope you have to know that there is a good solution out there.

716
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
You just have to, you have to find it.

717
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Anyway, what was I doing?

718
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,600
Oh, I don't need to do another player P.

719
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,700
We already have the player be there.

720
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:53,200
All I need to do is say world the tile side and pixels right tile

721
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,500
size.

722
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:00,200
In pixels x that tile X and that is going to give us how far over in

723
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
pixels, we have to do to account for the tiled.

724
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,500
The player is on.

725
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,300
Right?

726
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,600
So, there we go.

727
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,300
All right.

728
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,500
So, where to now world is not an arrow.

729
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,000
That's right.

730
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,500
Not in this function is not

731
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,800
Alright, so we've done a bunch of code changes.

732
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,100
There's no way this is going to work because we have surely forgotten

733
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:19,800
something somewhere.

734
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,400
But let's go ahead and run it and see where we're actually at.

735
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,500
Well, okay when I said there's no way it was actually going to work.

736
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:26,700
Okay.

737
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,400
See there we go.

738
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,100
At least we can watch.

739
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,000
I was like, I was like, I know there should be no way that this could

740
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,900
possibly work.

741
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,300
Let's be honest with ourselves.

742
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,400
It should be totally impossible and it was all right.

743
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,300
So what we want to do now is we want to go ahead and start debugging.

744
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,700
That one thing that is good to know.

745
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,600
It's like our player drawing is working properly.

746
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Right, that is roughly.

747
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,300
Where I think.

748
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,300
We thought that they should be.

749
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,800
But I guess we don't know for sure, unless we actually test it.

750
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,500
So, now that we know what we need to do, is go take a look at our

751
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,700
canonicalization code, get rid of the bugs in it, and then we should

752
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,100
be pretty much good to go and we can continue on with our next

753
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,600
changes.

754
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,000
All right.

755
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,800
So when I do the canonicalization here, basically, I'm, I want to make

756
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,500
sure that this is the, this is roughly, correct.

757
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,400
I get the new player P started.

758
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,000
I offset it by however, much, we want them to move.

759
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,000
I then asked to re canonicalize that

760
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:19,900
Do that.

761
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,500
I go ahead and I get the, the player left and the player, right?

762
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,700
Which at this point.

763
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,800
These are kind of irrelevant.

764
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,500
We don't even have to think about them because the players Center

765
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,100
should be.

766
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,700
Oh, that's a, that's a typo there.

767
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,000
Don't think that anything probably has anything to do with it.

768
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,800
But point being we do on tests that so basically is World Point, empty

769
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,000
is definitely not working, right?

770
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,100
And presumably since it's doing the same thing that it was doing

771
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,100
before.

772
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,100
What that means is we definitely have a bug in our

773
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
economic Eliezer.

774
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,300
So what we should be able to do now is we should be able to go ahead

775
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,600
and put the guy somewhere that we know is is not at all the correct.

776
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,600
For him.

777
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,300
So we know you know that he shouldn't be able to go in there.

778
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,400
And now I can just go set a breakpoint and see what was happening.

779
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Why are canonicalization doesn't seem to be producing the right

780
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,000
because I'm assuming, what's happening is the canonical?

781
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Answer is not actually canonicalizing.

782
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
It's not producing the right tile accent.

783
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,900
I'll why?

784
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,600
For the guy.

785
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,800
It's just leaving the the other parts, the same.

786
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,300
So, let's see what new player P is.

787
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Yeah, so that's exactly what I thought, right?

788
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,800
The tile X in the tile wires out.

789
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,300
What they were even though we've clearly gone more than one tile in

790
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
various directions.

791
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,400
So, basically, that's, that's fine.

792
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,400
So we just know that we've got a bug in our re canonicalize position.

793
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,300
Let's take a real quick, look at it just to see if we could spot the

794
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,200
problem here.

795
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,700
Okay.

796
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,200
Oh.

797
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Oh man.

798
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,200
Oh man.

799
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,800
That's a good.

800
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,700
That's a good.

801
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
That's a good start there.

802
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,500
Oh, I tell you, I don't I don't think that's the entirety of our bugs,

803
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,000
but that's that's, that's just being dumb.

804
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,200
So anyway,

805
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah, things that only happen on the stream, what you going to do?

806
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,600
That's awful.

807
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,500
Anyway, point being what we want to do here is we want to basically

808
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
say, okay is this is this part going to work properly?

809
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:25,699
I passed these guys up here to this thing here.

810
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:30,199
I do the Xs and the Y's I passed the result properly now instead of

811
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,800
the input which is ridiculous.

812
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,400
And yeah, that's I'm telling you it is hard on this.

813
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I make so many mistakes in the Stream that I've literally never seen

814
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:47,600
myself, make before, like, that's crazy passing the pose instead

815
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,000
there.

816
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,300
It's like, it's like, it's, yeah, I wonder if we're going to have to

817
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,300
start doing some things guard wise, like, I don't know.

818
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,600
Like I never use comps for example, but kant's would catch that.

819
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,600
I never ever have any concept bugs, but that's totally a concept.

820
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,000
Ugh.

821
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,900
And so, I wonder if I'll have to start doing things on the stream that

822
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,400
I would never actually have to do.

823
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Do in real life just because I can't catch those things.

824
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,700
When I'm talking, it could be well, we'll see how bad.

825
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,000
We'll see if we have a bad one.

826
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,900
If we have a bad one, at some point, that isn't trivial to find, then

827
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,700
I'll consider it.

828
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,100
I'd hate to have to start costing up all my code and making it

829
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,800
disgusting.

830
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,100
But, you know, if you have to, you have to program for the bugs,

831
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,700
you're going to have for the circus for the situation that you're in.

832
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,200
And so if you find yourself making a certain type of bug on the

833
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
stream, you gotta guard against that type of bug.

834
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,700
So what I would say you got to be, you got to be practical.

835
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,600
All right.

836
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,000
Anyway, let me go ahead and step on in there and see what happens

837
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,400
here.

838
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,500
So yeah, what happened there?

839
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,500
That's not good.

840
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,200
That, that was bad.

841
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Whatever, just happened.

842
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,300
What's going on there?

843
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,900
That basically we moved into it and it locked us into it, locked us

844
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,700
into place.

845
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,400
You can't feel it because you can't see what I'm typing on the

846
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,000
keyboard.

847
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,800
But yeah, so tilak's is for tile wise, one.

848
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,900
Did we just basically?

849
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,400
So I think what happened is, did we just did, we just accept a move

850
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,600
that we couldn't get out of recognized with new player P.

851
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,400
A plea, we were not supposed to ever be accepting.

852
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,300
Moves that were invalid.

853
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
So I wonder what happened there.

854
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
Exactly.

855
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Something fishy is going on here.

856
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,400
What am I missing?

857
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,600
So you cannot new player.

858
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
P equals game State player.

859
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,000
P.

860
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,800
We do our tile relative X and Y Deltas.

861
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,400
We then re canonicalize that position.

862
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,600
Which is fine.

863
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,400
We take the player left, we clone it.

864
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:06,700
Oh, that's that's a that's a incorrect thing as well.

865
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:11,500
This is not the bug that I was just looking at but these guys are

866
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,700
should actually be testing off the new player position as well.

867
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:15,800
Right?

868
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,000
Because we're trying to test the player left from the new place.

869
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,100
He will be standing not the old place where he was.

870
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,400
So that's also supposed to be that way.

871
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,600
Okay, so,

872
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,000
We owe and in fact, you know what, that actually is the bug because

873
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,500
that never mind that actually is the bug because basically what will

874
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,700
happen there is it would allow us to do the move.

875
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,800
But then the next time we try to test the player left in the right,

876
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,400
they'll be wrong, right?

877
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,800
The, the they won't be wrong.

878
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
They say, we tried to press the player left in the playwright.

879
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,900
They'll be inside something, and we can't go anywhere.

880
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,600
So yeah, that actually that actually was the book, I believe.

881
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So, let's take a look here.

882
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,900
Yeah, so now we're back to working albeit not pretty.

883
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,800
You know, it's not pretty, it's true, but we are working again, and

884
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,100
that's all we really wanted for now.

885
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,100
So let's plow for Words.

886
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,900
I'd like to get a bunch of this stuff done on this string if possible.

887
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
So, let's plow forwards.

888
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,800
So, what I'd like to do now is say, okay.

889
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
Can we go ahead and change things?

890
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,900
Perhaps to being not in pixels anymore.

891
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,500
Right?

892
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,600
Like, can we get rid?

893
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,400
Of the whole pixel situation.

894
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,800
And so I think what I could do at least for the players motion, right,

895
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,700
you know, and so so let's say, you know, the players motion is going

896
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,500
to be in meters from now on and I don't know how fast the players

897
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,700
should really move, you know plate.

898
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,000
I feel like players typically run pretty fast.

899
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,200
I don't know if two meters.

900
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,600
A second is a good running speed for somebody.

901
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,400
How fast is the?

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
In how fast is the fastest human?

903
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
44.7 2 km.

904
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,400
So twelve point four, two meters per second.

905
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,700
Wow, that's fast.

906
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,500
Don't you think 12 meters a second?

907
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,200
All right, Usain Bolt.

908
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,800
Well, we probably aren't as fast as Usain Bolt, but it's for a game

909
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,200
character.

910
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
We could move 10 meters per second.

911
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,300
Right?

912
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:36,200
So let's say we do 10 meters per second here and I believe although

913
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,500
where is our time step.

914
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Actually multiplied by the time step anywhere here.

915
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,500
Do we get rid of that or something?

916
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:48,800
I thought we were doing that, which was if you remember correctly, I

917
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
passed it in here.

918
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,300
I remember passing it in here in handmade platform.

919
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,500
We have a thing in our input Duty for frame.

920
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,800
Are we actually using Ard teacher frame?

921
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,500
Yes, we are.

922
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,700
Okay, so there it is.

923
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,500
So basically, we have our duty for frame.

924
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,800
So these are in meters per second, if

925
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,900
We switch to the player to actually being.

926
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,500
Excuse me, if we switch all of the player coordinates out of pixels,

927
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,200
right?

928
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,300
And so if we switch all the player coordinates out of pixels, we'd

929
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,800
have player with and player height, you know, to be honest.

930
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
I don't really know how big of the player with the player height

931
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,400
should be.

932
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:34,300
I think we said something like 1.4 F was going to be was going to be

933
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,600
the height of the of the kid, right?

934
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,000
I don't know.

935
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,300
I mean, like I said, these are all kind of fungible.

936
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,100
So if the players height was one point for f in me.

937
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,500
Is something like this.

938
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,100
Then their width might be, I don't know 7.5 of that.

939
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
I mean, I don't know what people what, you know, these are cartoony

940
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
kind of characters.

941
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,100
So we're gonna have to play with these again.

942
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
It's it's kind of fun to do.

943
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:00,800
We want them to be sort of close if you will.

944
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,200
We wanted to be, you know, in the ballpark of real units, but they're

945
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
not real.

946
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,700
They're not it's not photorealistic rendering that we're after here.

947
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,200
So if you see our guy now, he's super tiny right here.

948
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,400
Moves super slowly.

949
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,400
And he's super, super small.

950
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,600
What happened there?

951
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,100
Tile relative is less than World tile, huh?

952
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,900
So this are canonicalization.

953
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Assert fired.

954
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's find out.

955
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,200
Why tile real?

956
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,700
So it's right on it.

957
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,100
So what did offset produce?

958
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,900
Offset produced negative 1.

959
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,900
And so this must have been a case where it was right on the border and

960
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,700
the floor produced exactly the value, right?

961
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,800
Hmm.

962
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,000
I don't know what we want to do in that case.

963
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,400
That's that's a pretty interesting case.

964
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,600
So, let's see if we can.

965
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,200
Let's take a look back out and see exactly what happened here.

966
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,200
Right?

967
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,500
So, we have our new player P, which has not been modified yet, and it

968
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
looks like this.

969
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,000
And you can see that the tile relative X.

970
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,900
In fact, I don't think we've ever seen this before on the stream.

971
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
So, I'll point it out.

972
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,900
Now, basically, the tile relative X is a number.

973
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,200
That's actually represented in scientific notation here because it's

974
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,100
so tiny.

975
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,300
I don't know if, you know scientific notation.

976
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,600
But basically I don't know if we can get Google to show us.

977
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,900
Sort of it expanded out in zeros.

978
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Let's hope that it that it does.

979
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,300
Okay.

980
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,400
It doesn't, can you get it to?

981
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,000
Well point being?

982
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
If you don't know, scientific notation, basically, the E is sort of

983
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,900
just telling you how to how to, to shift that decimal point, right?

984
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,900
So basically it's going seven but it's going 7 this way.

985
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,000
So it's getting uh sorry so seven this way.

986
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,800
So it's getting smaller.

987
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,700
It's going, it's going out this way.

988
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,400
So it's like .005 - .030 5.

989
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,800
A super, super, super tiny number.

990
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,700
Since it's a super, super super, super tiny number at that point, when

991
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,300
we do our floor F, which I think I can call a floor, F in here, can't

992
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:41,900
I can, I don't know if I can or not new player P dot.

993
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,700
Tell ya, so if we call our floor function, our floor function

994
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,500
properly, gives us the negative one that we expected.

995
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:49,800
Right?

996
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,700
Because we're calling this the

997
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,900
These math function.

998
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,800
We know that it's been, totally, bulletproof rights, given us the

999
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
negative 1, which is correct, because this is a tiny negative number,

1000
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,300
right?

1001
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:06,500
But then what happens is, if we take our negative 1 and we multiply it

1002
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
by the tile.

1003
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,300
By the tile size that the pixels on a side, right?

1004
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,900
Because let's go back and look at, let me, let me show you the the

1005
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,400
function itself here, right?

1006
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,400
We have the tile side and pixels.

1007
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:24,900
We're multiplying that offset by the tile side and pixels, right?

1008
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,900
And so the tile side and pixels tile side in pixels is, oops.

1009
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,300
What's the problem?

1010
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,500
Expression must have pointer type?

1011
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,400
But it does.

1012
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,600
It's the world.

1013
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,800
What was wrong with that?

1014
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,200
Tha side and pixels is 60.

1015
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,000
So it doesn't actually matter.

1016
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,800
We don't need that.

1017
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Right.

1018
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,400
So basically - 60 is what we would be adding to this, to this value,

1019
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,900
right here, right?

1020
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,900
We would be adding, we would be, we would be subtracting, 60.

1021
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,600
No, sorry, we would be.

1022
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Doing 60, because we subtract a negative 1 times 60.

1023
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,300
So we add 62 it, right?

1024
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,500
And as you can see here, this is the number that we should be getting

1025
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,000
fifty.

1026
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,500
Nine point.

1027
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:12,800
Nine.

1028
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:12,900
Nine.

1029
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,200
Nine.

1030
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,300
Nine.

1031
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:13,500
Nine.

1032
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,900
Nine nine, nine nine, nine blah, right.

1033
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:20,400
That's the number that we actually want to get but unfortunately, we

1034
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,000
don't actually get that number and the reason that we don't actually

1035
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
get that number is because we can't actually store it in the Precision

1036
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,800
that we actually have for our float that

1037
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,300
that's presumably doing this in doubles and I assume that if we

1038
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,700
actually take and do this entirely and float, that we would not get

1039
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,100
that value.

1040
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,300
Course.

1041
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,700
I don't actually know how to make it.

1042
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,600
Do a cast to float.

1043
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah.

1044
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,500
So if you take a look at what happens if we try to store it in a

1045
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,700
32-bit floating point value, instead of 64 bit floating point value,

1046
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,700
you'll notice it just goes to 60.

1047
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,800
Now the problem with it going to 60, right?

1048
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,800
Is that that's actually technically back on the other tile, right?

1049
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,200
So what do we do here?

1050
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:03,600
Right.

1051
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,300
What do you know?

1052
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
What's what's our solution to this problem?

1053
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,500
If we want to be robust in, in that particular case.

1054
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And so there's a couple things here.

1055
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,700
I mean, first of all, I think, I think I want to kind of move this

1056
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
over into the new scheme first before, I worry too much about getting

1057
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,700
all of the numerical stuff, correct.

1058
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So I'm tempted to try to just say, let's leave that for now, but

1059
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,600
What we do need to do is we need to think about that.

1060
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,200
That problem will always exist for us.

1061
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,500
If we if we don't have a way to solve it, if that makes sense.

1062
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,800
Right?

1063
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,500
We always are going to need some way of figuring out how to solve that

1064
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,500
particular problem.

1065
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,200
So we need to think about when we actually do the math here to re

1066
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,600
canonicalize our numbers.

1067
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,700
Now, first of all, they'll always be positive.

1068
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,100
So we do have that on our side.

1069
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
Presumably, well.

1070
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,400
Okay, I shouldn't actually say that.

1071
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,900
The that's not actually true.

1072
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
They won't always be positive.

1073
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,700
So we will have to deal with the negative because you can be outside

1074
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,900
the tile to the negative side.

1075
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,500
So, anyway, we won't really have much to go on.

1076
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What will have to basically do is figure out a good, floating-point,

1077
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,900
way to make sure that we can always extract out the whole number part

1078
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,400
and move it.

1079
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:19,800
Now.

1080
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,400
I'm thinking that maybe, you know, we can do eventually is use like a

1081
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,900
fracked like you something that extracts the fractional part of

1082
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,400
something.

1083
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,500
And, you know, like something like

1084
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,200
I don't actually know if what is it.

1085
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,900
Like Frac AB, I don't remember what it is.

1086
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,000
There's a couple different things that we can do that are that are C

1087
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,000
runtime Library functions or things that we can actually call in SEC

1088
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,700
as well that we might be able to use to make it cleaner that.

1089
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,600
But I don't know if those who still suffer from that problem.

1090
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,300
So this will be something that will basically have to deal with.

1091
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,100
I don't I don't know offhand exactly the best way because I don't

1092
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,400
really want to add.

1093
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,700
I don't feel like the right thing to do here would be to add a bunch

1094
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,800
of finicky.

1095
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,200
Where we like check again to see if it ended up being rounded or

1096
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,300
whatever because I feel like we should be able to basically just

1097
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,400
extract the fractional part of the floating-point number directly,

1098
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,100
which you can do.

1099
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,300
Like I said, I don't remember the the mnemonics for and stuff but we

1100
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,900
should be able to do something where we do something that's not going

1101
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,100
to maybe doesn't involve the divide or you know, we just do an F mod

1102
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,400
of the thing.

1103
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,100
Instead of actually doing a divide.

1104
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,800
I feel like there's something clean but we would be able to do there.

1105
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,000
Where if we actually think it through we won't have to do a bunch of

1106
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,800
Finicky stuff here, right?

1107
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,400
So, I'm going to put a to do here and say need to handle the.

1108
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:38,700
Okay?

1109
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:47,400
Need to do something that doesn't use the divide multiply method for

1110
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:55,900
re canonicalizing, because this can end up rounding back onto the

1111
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,600
tile.

1112
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,100
You just came from.

1113
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:58,600
Right?

1114
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,900
And there's reasons to do that too.

1115
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,100
Again, like went, like I said, we're going to make this one.

1116
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
We're going to make this better.

1117
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,600
The other thing that I don't like is like this stuff here.

1118
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,200
Like well, I guess we'll be getting rid of this.

1119
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,900
I gotta say this only moves like one tile count in the other direction

1120
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,400
and stuff like that.

1121
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,600
But I guess that's that's will be getting rid of that in a second

1122
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,000
anyway, so it's we'll just leave it at that but point being that's

1123
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,400
that's something that I don't really like about this at all.

1124
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,500
That's just not good.

1125
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,900
So

1126
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,300
The other thing that I would say here is probably ads ad bounds

1127
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,600
checking to prevent wrapping might be a good thing to do just for

1128
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,300
security sake.

1129
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
All right, so just I just want to make sure everyone kind of knew what

1130
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,600
was going on there.

1131
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,600
So that I could you know, when we come back to it will have to handle

1132
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,100
those things.

1133
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,200
I just want to take since we had it happening.

1134
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,200
I want to take a minute to sort of explain what was going on there.

1135
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,400
All right.

1136
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,300
So now that we're starting to move things.

1137
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,600
Let me finish what I was doing.

1138
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,900
And then when we go back to,

1139
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,200
That we can also think about all the other stuff we need to do to the

1140
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,000
tilemap stuff.

1141
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,100
So the first thing I want to do is say, okay, what we need to do here,

1142
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,500
if the tile relative stuff, if all the tile relative stuff, is now

1143
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:18,100
actually just in sort of actual meter units, right?

1144
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,300
Then everywhere that we use a tile relative X at this point.

1145
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,700
Has to take that into account, right?

1146
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,700
They all have to sort of be aware of that fact, which means that these

1147
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:28,900
guys,

1148
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,700
Now will no longer be using tile side and pixels, they will to

1149
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,600
determine whether you move from a toddler a tile.

1150
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,900
They'll all from now on be using tile side in meters.

1151
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,200
Right?

1152
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,200
So no more pixels.

1153
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,300
Pixels is gone.

1154
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,300
It'll entirely be Tau sided M all the time, right?

1155
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,800
And so that's fine.

1156
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,900
Now when we come down here and we do our testing, the testing should

1157
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,800
work properly because it's still using.

1158
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,100
It's all it's really that was the only thing that had to happen for

1159
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,800
that to be a m.

1160
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,400
When we come down here, we will have to go.

1161
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,100
Okay.

1162
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,200
Now, this relative X isn't something that we can just add in this

1163
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,000
relative X relative.

1164
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,500
Why?

1165
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,500
Because it is in meters, but we need it to be in pixels.

1166
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,800
And so what we need is essentially something that does a m, 2 pixels

1167
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,400
transform, right?

1168
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,900
You basically need something that can do m, 2 pixels, right?

1169
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,900
Where we do something like that, where we can where we can, where we

1170
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,200
can multiply by that value.

1171
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,800
To get us what we should actually get.

1172
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,100
In pixel, since we want to know where to draw the player we have where

1173
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,500
they are and M offset from the tile but we want it in pixels.

1174
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,900
So we need something that that we do m 2 pixels.

1175
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,200
And so how do we actually compute that right?

1176
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:57,500
So we need M to pixels right again, I always talk about DeMint

1177
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,500
dimensional analysis.

1178
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:58,700
Right?

1179
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,300
And this is another case for dimensional analysis.

1180
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,900
One of the most useful things practically useful things.

1181
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,300
I learned in chemistry class dimensional analysis.

1182
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,600
I don't use chemistry class much.

1183
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,900
Every day, but we learned that in chemistry class dimensional analysis

1184
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,200
and you know, it always comes up.

1185
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,700
So we compute m 2 pixels.

1186
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,000
I want something that has M on the top.

1187
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,900
I'm sorry pixels on the top and M on the bottom, right?

1188
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,300
Because what I want to do dimensional analysis wise

1189
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm going to actually do that.

1190
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:37,900
Yeah, I want to be able to do something that ends up in pixels, but I

1191
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,400
have something that is in meters right at the moment.

1192
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,000
So, what I need to do is I need a times that thing, right by something

1193
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,500
that will produce pixels and cancel out meters, right?

1194
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,600
So I need something that's pixels per meter.

1195
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,500
Right?

1196
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,900
How many pixels are there per meter?

1197
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:00,600
Make sense.

1198
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:06,000
So if I had something that was measured both in pixels and M.

1199
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,100
I could put its pixel measurement on the top and it's m measurement on

1200
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:09,800
the bottom.

1201
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,100
And that would give me the ratio that I wanted.

1202
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,900
Right?

1203
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
And it just so happens that we have exactly that.

1204
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,200
We have the tile side and pixels.

1205
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,400
Right?

1206
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,800
And we have the tile side and M, so I can just do this division here.

1207
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,400
And now, I've got a ratio that will always transform one to the other

1208
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,100
make sense.

1209
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,300
Really, really straightforward.

1210
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,800
Never Gonna never going to remember that.

1211
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,700
That's a world world.there.

1212
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,600
All right.

1213
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:40,000
So in theory, when I run this now, well, that's not very good.

1214
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,300
That that.

1215
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,400
I don't know if you can see that.

1216
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,000
Is that so funny?

1217
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,200
Huh?

1218
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,400
The guy is so tiny.

1219
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,800
We didn't who we didn't ever change his.

1220
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:08,200
I'm sorry, we didn't ever change this width and height to be, is this

1221
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,600
little he's moving around at the fast speed, but he's super tiny.

1222
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,000
Okay.

1223
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:14,700
All right.

1224
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,500
Sorry, we didn't ever change his player width and height.

1225
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,600
Okay, I get a little bit too much fun, all that.

1226
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,400
That's pretty funny.

1227
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,900
So the player with and height we height, we change to be in meters.

1228
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:36,800
So those who obviously have to be done with m 2 pixels, as well, as

1229
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
you can see there.

1230
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,100
So there's our guy and off he goes.

1231
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:47,600
All right, so we are currently still a little janky here.

1232
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,100
I don't know.

1233
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,200
We're moving, we're moving awfully fast, but I suspect that may

1234
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,800
actually be the correct run speed because we boosted his run speed

1235
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,800
quite a bit by switching to there.

1236
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,000
And we remember we aren't doing our proper.

1237
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,100
Detection yet.

1238
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,600
So we have, we still have the super awful quick injection in there.

1239
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,900
I don't know why he's able to Tunnel right through those.

1240
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,600
I don't even have no idea.

1241
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,700
I certainly don't want to know.

1242
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,300
So we've broken a bunch of stuff.

1243
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,800
So I have to go fix all that.

1244
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,400
I'm not sure what's going on.

1245
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,500
There is a tall that's crazy town.

1246
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,500
But anyway, I suspect that we just have the tile X and Y wrong.

1247
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
So, what I want to do now.

1248
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,700
Now this is sort of working a little bit more.

1249
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,900
What I want to do now is you'll notice that I can't really tell

1250
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,300
L like my first thought is okay.

1251
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,100
We're going to make a few more changes to this.

1252
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,700
I have to keep debugging these things as I as I do.

1253
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,900
My sort of steps to get the code better.

1254
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,400
One of the things that is unclear to me is, I don't know what, tile,

1255
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,400
the game thinks the players in.

1256
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,500
So, what I'd like to do is just add a piece of code really quickly.

1257
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,200
That would like, highlight that so that I don't have to keep like

1258
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,900
stepping into the bugger to figure it out.

1259
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,600
Right?

1260
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,300
So what I want to do in here is sort of say like okay, you know, maybe

1261
00:55:59,500 --> 00:55:59,900
when we do,

1262
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,000
Just test.

1263
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,400
I'm going to turn the tile like black or something.

1264
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,400
So I'll turn the grey for the tile black.

1265
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:12,100
If the row equals the players row, right?

1266
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:18,800
So if game State player P dot dot y, equals the row and the column

1267
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,000
equals game State player p.x.

1268
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,700
Then that would let me see which row and column it thinks the dudes

1269
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,100
on, right?

1270
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,900
And that, that

1271
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,500
Helps me sort of debug that, that that part of the problem.

1272
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,900
So, that style X tile why, right?

1273
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,200
So, let's see here.

1274
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,100
So you can see that that's like he's offset.

1275
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,600
He is not properly, you know, it's it's actually the tile part is

1276
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,100
working properly to some degree, but it's offset from where the guy

1277
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:53,800
should be.

1278
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,700
So we basically have we have a bug that and I hope that you can see

1279
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,500
how easy it was for.

1280
00:56:59,500 --> 00:56:59,800
Me, too.

1281
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,100
Of like, see what's going on now by adding that debug code, one of the

1282
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,400
things that is generally true and you'll see this over and over again,

1283
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,800
as we get into more complicated stuff on the stream things that could

1284
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,300
be hard to see or realize are happening.

1285
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,500
If you don't draw them become very easy to see what's happening when

1286
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,300
you do draw them.

1287
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,100
And so, this is pretty easy for us to see like, oh, okay.

1288
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,700
That's totally not correct.

1289
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:29,600
So first, we have to figure out which is wrong, is it?

1290
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,800
Is it where we're drawing the guy that's wrong?

1291
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,900
Or is it the computation for what tile?

1292
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,400
He's in.

1293
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,700
That is wrong.

1294
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:41,200
And so that's the first thing that we got to figure out.

1295
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,700
So let's go take a look.

1296
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,300
Let's see where we're drawing the guy.

1297
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,900
So we're drawing the guy at the upper left X, plus the pixel said,

1298
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,600
that's the tile at which the guy is.

1299
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:59,000
So what I'm going to do actually is 0 - the player with and the player

1300
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,600
height, right?

1301
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,600
We got to actually get those that there you go.

1302
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,300
There's the bug.

1303
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,900
There's a bug right there for starters.

1304
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,600
So there's our guy now.

1305
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:13,500
He is at least man, I gotta I gotta kind of slow.

1306
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,900
Got a slow him down.

1307
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,500
He's he moves so fast now.

1308
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,500
I can't even get him.

1309
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,100
Hussein bolt is too.

1310
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,500
Darn.

1311
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,100
Quick is the problem.

1312
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,200
I'm going to slow him down considerably.

1313
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:23,900
I'm sorry.

1314
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,300
It was saying you're going to have a lesser world record, but I need

1315
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,100
to be able to see as I move out.

1316
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,700
I just want to verify so that to me.

1317
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,600
Looks like it's correct.

1318
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,700
As far as which tile is being.

1319
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,500
He's being tested.

1320
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,500
Yeah.

1321
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,100
Yeah, yeah.

1322
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,300
Yeah.

1323
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:47,900
Yeah.

1324
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,700
Yes.

1325
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,500
Okay, so that looks pretty good to me.

1326
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,800
So, it looks like we just had a drawing bug again because we have a

1327
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,900
lot of units here.

1328
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,500
So as we're cleaning these things up, it kind of, you know, gets it

1329
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,600
gets hairy sometimes.

1330
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,000
Well as you're trying to clean up, you know, you don't you don't just

1331
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,100
get clean code for free.

1332
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,600
You got to you got to pay your dues.

1333
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,300
All right, so that looks pretty much, right?

1334
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,600
And then that's got the question of.

1335
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,500
Can we get out?

1336
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,500
Can we move to the next tile map?

1337
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,900
It doesn't look like we can at the moment for some reason.

1338
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,500
So why is that?

1339
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,000
What's wrong there?

1340
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,900
I'm not sure what is wrong there.

1341
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,300
So why can't we move to our next tile map?

1342
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,100
Did we leave the code in for the tile map?

1343
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:31,700
We did.

1344
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,300
Right reconnect.

1345
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,600
Last chord.

1346
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:41,200
Can still move someone to the next tile map, but I guess for some

1347
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,500
reason it was not working properly so that

1348
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,400
It would be, let's take let's let's go ahead and set a breakpoint

1349
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:46,800
there.

1350
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,800
Okay, we're almost out of time while we are out of time technically.

1351
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,700
So let's go ahead and test set a breakpoint there and see re

1352
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,800
canonicalize coordinate when we move out of the tile map.

1353
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,600
Worldcat.

1354
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,600
Oh, another bug.

1355
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,600
Should not be World count X.

1356
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,000
It should be towel count.

1357
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,800
Yeah, it was checking the wrong one.

1358
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,300
Again, when we did the extraction there.

1359
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,500
I messed it up.

1360
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,800
All right, so I think that should probably be what is going on here.

1361
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:24,600
Hello.

1362
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,200
Yeah, that broke something.

1363
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,600
What did I do?

1364
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,700
I'm confused.

1365
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,600
if star tile,

1366
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,300
hmm.

1367
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,100
There we go.

1368
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,500
If that is greater than tile count.

1369
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,100
How is tile count to?

1370
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,400
Are?

1371
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,900
We passing bogus number to this guy?

1372
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,600
Tom app context.

1373
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,600
Oh, even better.

1374
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,400
So we've got two bugs in here.

1375
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,200
It's not Tom up context.

1376
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,200
It's we want how many there are in each?

1377
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,100
Yeah.

1378
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,300
So these are just again.

1379
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,100
This is just

1380
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,700
This is that that that was just silly.

1381
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,500
We want that.

1382
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,500
That's how many tile Maps there are cross.

1383
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,300
Again.

1384
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,000
You can see why I keep saying.

1385
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,600
I want to clean all this up because you just don't want

1386
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:35,200
You don't want to have this many different things all in flight at the

1387
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,300
same time, right?

1388
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,300
So I really want to get to the point where everything is much more

1389
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,200
condensed and we have a reliable set of small numbers of things that

1390
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,500
work in a particular way.

1391
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,000
Because before whether it's like the tile maps in the tiles and three

1392
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,100
different indices it just you start making it just a lot of mistakes.

1393
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:55,100
And so that's why I really want to start condensing everything down to

1394
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,400
less stuff because that just, it's much easier.

1395
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,100
To not make errors.

1396
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:02,900
Alright.

1397
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,800
So here we go.

1398
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,300
Now our guy is moving along, nicely and happily we're using only

1399
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,800
canonicalize Physicians.

1400
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,300
So that's good.

1401
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,600
He's I slowed him down a bit because the Usain Bolt thing was he was

1402
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,100
bolting a little bit too fast.

1403
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,300
And that's just no good.

1404
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,400
So now he's kind of slowly Meandering along, we can see a little more

1405
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,400
carefully, what he's doing and it seems to work properly for all our

1406
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,100
previous cases.

1407
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,200
All right, so that's that's good.

1408
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,300
That's not great.

1409
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,200
Progress.

1410
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,600
But it's yes, ma'am.

1411
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,600
Pretty happy with that.

1412
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,200
I'm pretty happy with that.

1413
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,400
We've got one step down, which is removed the raw, and we're right on

1414
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:38,900
the cusp.

1415
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,900
We also went ahead and we changed the players coordinates to a

1416
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,300
Resolute resolution independent.

1417
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,000
Once we got rid of this to do right here, right?

1418
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,800
So that's nice.

1419
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,300
These guys would be one thing.

1420
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,600
I might say is, I'd still leave it to doing here, which is should

1421
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,400
these be from the center of

1422
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,000
a tile.

1423
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,100
And I'm not sure exactly the right way to make that determination.

1424
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,100
But but that, that I do want to check out.

1425
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,400
All right, so we got rid of that to do.

1426
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,300
So, that's nice.

1427
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,400
We've got it down to only one.

1428
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:15,900
Excuse me.

1429
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,600
We've got it down to only one type of coordinate and we are within

1430
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:23,500
Striking Distance of also packing these guys down which will finally

1431
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,100
let us get rid of the town map stuff and have a nice kind of sparse

1432
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,600
representation for our town map that we can always look up into.

1433
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,200
So I think we're in pretty good shape.

1434
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,300
I think tomorrow I'll be able to do that stuff and then we'll be ready

1435
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,100
to start tackling some of these other issues.

1436
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,600
So alright, that's not bad.

1437
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,800
That's not too bad for one day's work.

1438
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,600
Not too bad.

1439
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,100
Alright, let's go ahead and go off.

1440
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,800
To the Q&A.

1441
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:52,200
If you could please put Q: before your questions so I can see them.

1442
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,500
That would be very handy.

1443
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,100
And please keep your questions to stuff.

1444
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,100
We've actually coded so far either today or on a previous stream.

1445
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,600
If you want to ask questions about off-topic stuff.

1446
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:07,000
You can come to the stream early come about 15 minutes before the

1447
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,700
scheduled start time, and that's when we talk about that sort of

1448
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:09,700
stuff.

1449
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:12,500
So plenty of chances to do that every day.

1450
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,000
There's another 15 minutes to do that.

1451
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,200
So let's go.

1452
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,600
To the Q.

1453
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:15,800
A

1454
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,500
Isn't this a good time for some on-screen text to make watching the

1455
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,500
values for the player position easier having to check the watch window

1456
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,400
as you step through is such a pain for this.

1457
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,200
I totally agree with you.

1458
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,000
But unfortunately, if you think about what would be required for us to

1459
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,800
put some text on the screen, we'd have to have a renderer.

1460
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,900
And so until I really need to do that.

1461
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,700
I'm not going to because I want to get a little bit further with just

1462
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,500
How play with the play code so that I can write the renderer nicely

1463
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:00,200
and not have to worry about about how kind of ping-ponging back and

1464
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,700
forth if it becomes a little bit dire, then yes, I would do that.

1465
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,400
But that's the reason I haven't put any text on the screen.

1466
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,900
That's because we don't have a text renderer, but we will eventually

1467
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,300
it just, you know, cart before the horse and so on.

1468
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,400
What is the variable called gray?

1469
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,600
So basically what this is is this is the color.

1470
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,100
This draws the tile map.

1471
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,600
On the screen are a little debug.

1472
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,400
This is the thing that draws the rectangles to show us what the what

1473
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,800
parts of the top map are occupied in not.

1474
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,200
So basically what happens is for each tile in the tile map.

1475
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,000
It assumes that it's going to be gray.

1476
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,200
And then if the tile is occupied, it changes it to White.

1477
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,700
And if the player is on the tile, it changed it to Black.

1478
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,700
And that is what you saw here.

1479
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,700
Where the these are the white ones.

1480
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,500
And these are the gray ones.

1481
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,400
That's the black one, right?

1482
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,000
So that's what that is.

1483
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,200
How does the difficulty of conceptualizing, this type of code?

1484
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,800
Compared to say?

1485
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,400
Coating the back end to a web application.

1486
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,600
Um, well, I mean, I guess what I would say is it all depends on the

1487
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,700
web application.

1488
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,300
I mean, like for example, there are certain web applications, for

1489
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,300
example back ends, that could be very complicated because they might

1490
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,000
be very multi threaded and be doing a lot of stuff with multi-threaded

1491
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,200
performance and stuff like that.

1492
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,400
So it all depends like the difficulty is usually not about

1493
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,700
Necessarily what type of application it is, but more how well

1494
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,800
engineered it ends up being because there's probably web application

1495
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,800
back ends that are just super trivial and dumb.

1496
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,800
And there's probably web back ends that are very, very complicated and

1497
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,100
have a lot of performance because strength to them, depending on the

1498
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,500
company, you know, who who was writing it and what they were doing.

1499
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,500
The window title bar has a nice place to spit out some text.

1500
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,500
It's true.

1501
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,700
We could cheese it out.

1502
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,000
Look, I guess what I would say is that you guys gotta just, you gotta

1503
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
be patient.

1504
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,800
It would be nice.

1505
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,300
It's true.

1506
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,000
But one of the things about making stuff by hand is you got to kind of

1507
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,800
go in waves.

1508
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:23,000
And when we get there, we will have some crazy, awesome, debug overlay

1509
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,300
stuff.

1510
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,500
I promise you that, but it is going to take us a little while to get

1511
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,100
there because we're going to render a first

1512
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,800
This is in regards to the input recording code, but I don't think we

1513
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,200
ever use the 03 play buffer in the win32 state since the code assumes

1514
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,400
that 04 input recording.

1515
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,100
Index means that we recording the first element never gets used.

1516
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,200
Yes, you are.

1517
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,900
Probably correct about that.

1518
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:02,100
So that's in back here in the replay buffers because 0 means we're not

1519
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,300
recording if I remember correctly.

1520
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,000
So basically

1521
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,600
Where are we here?

1522
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,900
That's that's in here.

1523
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,600
Yes, so I think for the replay buffers, that is true.

1524
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm not sure what the fix is that you'd want to do there.

1525
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,000
So there's a couple different ways.

1526
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,600
We could solve that problem.

1527
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,399
I'm not sure what the best way to solve that problem is I thought of

1528
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:47,399
something and I haven't gone back and change it.

1529
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,200
I realized after we did all this work.

1530
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,399
That actually none of it was necessary.

1531
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,600
Sometimes that happens, the reason that I've is necessary is because I

1532
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,800
realized that the transient storage.

1533
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,200
Actually split into two halves and only one half actually has to get

1534
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,500
stored and the half-ass get stored is very small.

1535
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,899
So all of that crazy stuff we did like playing with it, trying to make

1536
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:17,899
it faster.

1537
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,500
I think we actually didn't need to do any of which is kind of sad, but

1538
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:31,800
What are you going to do?

1539
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,800
I just didn't think of it at the time.

1540
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:37,500
I had I wasn't really considering what parts actually need to get

1541
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,899
sword, which parts didn't.

1542
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,300
So we're going to have to do some work here.

1543
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,399
In fact, I can put

1544
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:52,800
I could do their, transient storage needs to be broken up into game,

1545
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,300
transient and cash, transient.

1546
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:04,800
And only, the former need be saved for State playback.

1547
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:09,900
So, yeah, so that was the mess up on my part and did cause a lot of

1548
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,900
aggravation that didn't actually need to get caused.

1549
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,500
But what you going to do?

1550
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,700
I didn't really want it to wrap my to do there.

1551
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:18,300
Thank you e, Max, but that would put thanks, but no.

1552
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:18,800
Thanks.

1553
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,500
So yeah, so that was not necessary and that was a mistake.

1554
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,700
That said, if we want to fix this problem because I believe what our

1555
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,700
convention was is that zero means that we're not recording.

1556
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,800
So if we want to fix that, what we could do is we could, we could just

1557
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,400
say that we always use one, extra replay buffer and the first replay

1558
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,200
buffer is fallow.

1559
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,100
I mean, I suppose we could do something like that, right?

1560
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:51,800
I don't remember exactly how many of those

1561
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,100
We actually use our how we actually use those.

1562
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,000
Let's take a look.

1563
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,800
Replay buffers.

1564
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:05,000
So the index comes in here so we could just say assert index is

1565
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,100
greater than 0.

1566
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,600
We could just do that.

1567
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:09,600
Right?

1568
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,000
Yeah.

1569
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:14,200
So if you want to you could do that.

1570
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,600
I think that would probably work fine for now.

1571
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But like I said, we should probably take a look at that in a different

1572
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:21,400
way.

1573
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:22,300
Yeah.

1574
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:22,700
Yes.

1575
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,400
I know.

1576
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,300
Thank you.

1577
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:25,800
How do we

1578
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,700
We're going to have to deal with this guy sooner or later because this

1579
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,800
assertion is going to is going to cause issues.

1580
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,800
I guess we could Nerf the assertion but I don't really like that idea

1581
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:36,400
either.

1582
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:41,600
I mean, it is theoretically possible that we could just allow that

1583
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:48,700
assertion to exist but or check for Epsilon, check for Epsilon away,

1584
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,200
if that makes sense, but I just those are the kinds of things that,

1585
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,400
you know, are going to

1586
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,600
They're usually just signs that you did the floating Point math wrong.

1587
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,700
And so I usually

1588
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,900
And if I actually sit down, you know, and kind of do it a little more

1589
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:05,300
carefully.

1590
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:10,600
So like for example, we could just do that and say to do fixed

1591
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,100
floating Point math, so this can be that instead.

1592
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,900
But yeah, for now since we don't want to be asserting all over the

1593
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,100
place, that may be something that we're just going to have to live

1594
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,100
with a less than optimal.

1595
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,100
Sort of assertion.

1596
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,700
Anyway, so checking the loop Point here.

1597
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,400
I'll go ahead and

1598
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,100
And make sure that that's still working.

1599
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:36,700
Yeah.

1600
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:38,900
Yeah.

1601
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,200
So yeah, so we can do that.

1602
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,300
I don't know if that helps for now.

1603
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,800
But yeah, really that replay stuff.

1604
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,100
I should probably go.

1605
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,000
We should split the game out into something more reasonable because I

1606
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,400
realized all that work we did was not at all.

1607
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,900
Necessary is so

1608
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So yeah, sorry about that.

1609
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,600
Trevor Taps is, when do you decide to add visual cues to help the

1610
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,100
debugging?

1611
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,200
So the answer is right now, not that often because I don't have a

1612
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:10,800
renderer.

1613
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,700
Once we actually get the renderer up and running something that can

1614
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,000
actually put a lot of different graphics on the screen for real, you

1615
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,700
know, lines and overlay text and stuff like this.

1616
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,100
I will often add visual cues to debugging because

1617
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,800
I think in fact, it was John Carmack who originally said time spent

1618
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,300
visualizing is never wasted.

1619
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,100
Not sometimes not often.

1620
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,600
He was like never wasted.

1621
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:47,500
So he you know, he was of the opinion that you should always draw

1622
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,200
things out and I'm inclined to agree with that perspective.

1623
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:57,400
Basically, I think that any time I've ever pretty much whenever I take

1624
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,700
the time to display stuff.

1625
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,400
I always learn something.

1626
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:06,800
And so, once we actually have the ability to display things, you will

1627
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,900
see me doing a lot of it and we will build little systems that make it

1628
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,700
easy to make displays of stuff that.

1629
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,200
So as we go, we don't have to do a lot of work to add visualization.

1630
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,100
What are your thoughts on the progress you make daily?

1631
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,500
Would you say it becomes tedious coding so often or is your love for

1632
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:35,900
coding?

1633
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:36,400
So great.

1634
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,400
I see a burning passion in you to try and create Excellence.

1635
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,600
That's a very odd way to face that question.

1636
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,800
I feel like the progress that we've been making on handmade hero is

1637
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,400
decent.

1638
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,500
I mean, only one hour, a day of coding.

1639
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,600
Plus I have to explain things.

1640
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:59,800
So I'm not thinking as clearly.

1641
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,500
As I should be and it takes longer means that there's not that much we

1642
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,400
can do in a day and even so I feel like we've gotten pretty far.

1643
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:06,900
I mean,

1644
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,300
I think this will start looking like a game, you know, within the next

1645
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,000
two months or so.

1646
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,300
I mean, it'll be really zygote ish.

1647
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:16,500
Right?

1648
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,900
But it's like it's getting there very steadily and so, you know, I

1649
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,800
think the renderer will take us a lot of time and so it's going to be

1650
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,700
a big stall as that kind of comes together.

1651
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,900
And so that will be definitely something that delays the game becoming

1652
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,100
a game for quite some time because we want to do a bunch of rendering

1653
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:33,600
things.

1654
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,300
But you know in the next month or two, like I said, we'll have sort of

1655
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,300
our baby like

1656
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,000
Thing working.

1657
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,200
And it'll kind of look gamey.

1658
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,500
And then like the fact that we'll be getting there so quickly at only

1659
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,900
an hour a day.

1660
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,400
And it's not even a real hour.

1661
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:50,600
I've been pretty happy with that.

1662
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,400
So, I don't know if that was your question.

1663
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,600
But you know, I've been pretty happy with how things have been going

1664
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,100
so far.

1665
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,500
Does the code actually handle skipping a tile map if there are three

1666
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
Tom apps going from first to third.

1667
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,300
So the code right now is not really doing anything intelligent

1668
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:15,700
tilemap.

1669
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,000
So depending on what you mean by that, possibly know like this one.

1670
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,700
This code part wouldn't handle it but we're getting rid of that

1671
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:25,900
entirely and we're going to basically a virtual addressing scheme for

1672
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,500
the tiles, which is what we'll be doing.

1673
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,000
Tomorrow.

1674
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,900
We set ourselves up to do it today, by all the changes we made.

1675
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:34,700
And we've got one more big change to make, which is getting rid of the

1676
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,000
time.

1677
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:35,400
I BEC stop.

1678
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,800
Mopwai, and at that point we will basically be totally free from any

1679
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,600
concept of a tile map at all.

1680
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,500
We'll just be able to you'll be able to do whatever you want basically

1681
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,800
and and you could do smooth scrolling with it as well if you wanted

1682
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,100
to.

1683
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah, which some people expressed interest in.

1684
01:16:58,100 --> 01:17:00,700
Can the player go diagonally through the to wall tiles?

1685
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,000
Kitty-corner to each other with the current Collision code?

1686
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,900
Yes, they well.

1687
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,600
So, probably not, but only because of those Edge checks, but the

1688
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:16,400
plate, but the current Collision code is totally placeholder, and you

1689
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,800
could do something related, which is, if you just had enough speed,

1690
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,500
you could tile straight through a block tile, right?

1691
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,300
Because we only check the start and the end so you can tunnel through

1692
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,900
things that even if they're not kitty-corner.

1693
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,400
The reason you probably can't tunnel through kitty corner is because

1694
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,100
we're checking the edges of the tiles.

1695
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,800
And so it'd be really hard.

1696
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,400
Hard to move far enough to to not do it.

1697
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,500
So you probably actually can't.

1698
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,500
But it's only because sort of, by accident.

1699
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,400
The real answer is the current Collision code is not code you would

1700
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,500
ever use in a shipping game.

1701
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,800
It's just so that we can sort of get our bearings.

1702
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:53,800
Basically.

1703
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,800
What we'll be doing is again, we're trying to spec out our engine

1704
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,200
here.

1705
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,800
So these are sort of the things that we're going to want this.

1706
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,800
Right here will become an engine spec.

1707
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,600
It's saying that we need to move something from one place to another

1708
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,300
and know whether it collided in between and the engine will have a

1709
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:11,500
real Collision function that actually doesn't allow things like

1710
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:15,100
tunneling to occur if that makes sense.

1711
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,000
Why am I so fond of in line?

1712
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,000
So, in line is basically just a note to myself.

1713
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,900
So, one thing that's important to remember about in line is, in line

1714
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,600
is more or less meaningless.

1715
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,200
Like, if you put in line in the code, doesn't really mean anything.

1716
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,400
There is a real in line.

1717
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:46,300
It's called force in line.

1718
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:48,500
Let me show it to you.

1719
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,300
I think it has one underscore at the beginning.

1720
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,400
I don't know if it's got one or two.

1721
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:02,700
So this this guy is the actual in line, right?

1722
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,800
This guy says, you have to inline this function, like anywhere that

1723
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,400
you see a use of this function, inline it right?

1724
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:12,500
If that makes sense.

1725
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:20,700
This in line doesn't really do anything other than suggest for

1726
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,700
whatever that's worth to the compiler.

1727
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,500
That it might want to inline it.

1728
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,300
But in line in C++ is just weak sauce.

1729
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,300
It doesn't actually in line the function.

1730
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:33,100
It just says the compiler, maybe you should think about inlining it,

1731
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,300
but the compiler is always free to inline or not in line.

1732
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,400
Anything it wants to, it doesn't have to listen to me.

1733
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,300
So really these in lines when I'm putting them in here, are notes to

1734
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:44,000
myself that.

1735
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,200
I

1736
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,600
This function is probably one.

1737
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,000
I want to bake down to a size that could be inserted without actually

1738
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
having a call.

1739
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,000
Right?

1740
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,600
So basically this in line is like a note to Casey, which is look at

1741
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,300
these functions and see if they should become things that are in line

1742
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:01,400
of.

1743
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,200
All right.

1744
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,600
It's not actually telling the compiler, to inline it because the

1745
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,300
compiler doesn't really care as far as I know.

1746
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:08,900
Good compilers.

1747
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,200
Nowadays probably don't hardly care at all about what you say.

1748
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,100
You should in line, I think.

1749
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,300
They make their own decisions, but I could be wrong about that.

1750
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:18,900
So anyway, that's basically what that is.

1751
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,700
It's basically a note now we're compiling in debug mode.

1752
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,000
So that means it doesn't do anything at.

1753
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,400
All.

1754
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,500
Right, we have inlining turned off at the moment.

1755
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,700
So these are not getting in line.

1756
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:32,200
Anyway, so really, that's just a note to myself, if that makes sense.

1757
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,200
Are we going to have input envelopes for feel like acceleration in

1758
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:41,700
friction?

1759
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:42,500
Absolutely.

1760
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:44,800
Will have very good player movement code.

1761
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,200
Our player movement code will feel excellent because I want to go

1762
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,000
through all of the math.

1763
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,700
That's necessary to make that work.

1764
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,700
And so when we get to that point, we'll be doing all of those things.

1765
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,300
Can you explain what you meant by canonicalization in some simpler

1766
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:08,900
terms?

1767
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,400
Yes, or I can try.

1768
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,100
I'll do my best.

1769
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:25,800
So, we are driving towards a to a two-tier coordinate system.

1770
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:26,500
Right?

1771
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:30,900
What I'm trying to get to is I'm trying to get to, you know, like I

1772
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:35,400
said, on Monday was trying to get to is something where this is going

1773
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,100
to be.

1774
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,000
Let's see here.

1775
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,300
These are tiles.

1776
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,100
Each each one of these things is a tile, okay.

1777
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,100
So on the screen, you know, I've got my tiles and some of them are

1778
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,300
filled, right, you know, like this sort of thing and whatever.

1779
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,100
So here's my tile map and I want to talk about a location on this tile

1780
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,600
map.

1781
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,700
Well, if I want to talk about a look, the location of a tile, it's

1782
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:00,400
pretty easy.

1783
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,200
I can just make a grid and say what the location of something is by

1784
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:11,000
using the numbers that are on the grid by first using the Row first,

1785
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,500
using the column and then using the row, which we usually tells you no

1786
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,000
index.

1787
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:14,800
And a, why?

1788
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,900
For example, we can say, if I want to talk about this tile right here.

1789
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:25,400
Then I know I can say for comma 3 tells me where we are in the tile

1790
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,100
map, right?

1791
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,000
That is tile.

1792
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,600
That is tile for three.

1793
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:29,700
Okay.

1794
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:37,100
But we have people moving around this tilemap who are actually not

1795
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:39,900
constrained to lie exactly on the tile.

1796
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,300
So this person doesn't have to be standing directly on the tile or

1797
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:43,800
anything.

1798
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,800
They can be standing anywhere on this tile map.

1799
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,200
That can be standing like there.

1800
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,600
They can be standing over here.

1801
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:53,100
And so, what I want to do is I want to have a way of specifying where

1802
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,500
they are relative to the tile that they're in as well, so that there's

1803
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,600
two coordinates.

1804
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,700
There's the tile coordinate.

1805
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,900
Which is where you are in the tile map and then there's also basically

1806
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,700
the offset from that tile, right?

1807
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:12,900
Which is a floating Point number can be anywhere in here and at that's

1808
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,100
given in meters, right?

1809
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,200
So this is in tiles.

1810
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,200
This is in meters.

1811
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,800
When I say canonicalize or re canonicalize, I was just using the word

1812
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:26,500
canonical to basically mean what we are considering a proper.

1813
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:29,700
Set of coordinates.

1814
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:36,300
And what that means is, this offset should not Point outside the tile

1815
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:42,000
if I say tile 43, right, but then my offset Points, Way the heck back

1816
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,200
here.

1817
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:47,000
So actually the guy whose coordinate said he was in tile for three is

1818
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,600
actually entitled to one because of this huge offset that he's got

1819
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,600
right that could cause all kinds of problems for things where I'm

1820
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,000
checking tiles in some way.

1821
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,900
right, because if

1822
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,700
Look and see.

1823
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,800
Oh, he's in this tile.

1824
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,100
What do I know about this tile?

1825
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,600
Because I'm going to apply tile-based effects to him or something.

1826
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,100
Well, he's not in that tile.

1827
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,000
He's actually over here.

1828
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:14,200
So the user sees him over here, but he's says, his style is his

1829
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,600
position, says he's here.

1830
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,200
That's no good because now he's getting affection this tile, but the

1831
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,900
user sees them over here is like why is he getting like the water

1832
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,600
effect on him when there's no water over here at the waters over here,

1833
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,100
right?

1834
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,800
So when I say re canonicalize what I'm saying is take that off set.

1835
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,500
Right?

1836
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:31,800
That's in the position.

1837
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,700
Look to see if it is falling outside the tile and if it is reset the

1838
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,000
tile coordinates so that it's the actual tile there in and then re

1839
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,100
compute what the offset is to still put them in the same place.

1840
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,400
So to give you an example of what would happen.

1841
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,600
Let's say the tile was 56, so he's here, right?

1842
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,400
So I start off and I've got five comma.

1843
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:55,500
Six is my tile location, but my offset looks like that.

1844
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,200
Well, what happens after canonicalization is.

1845
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:02,100
I've got you know, 56 and some large offset.

1846
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:09,200
Then I after canonicalizing, I will get 66 right and a new offset that

1847
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,300
still points to the exact same location.

1848
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,700
But now it's a different offset.

1849
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,800
It's an offset from this corner instead of this corner, right?

1850
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,200
That's canonicalization.

1851
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:20,000
And so what we want to do is we want to be able to always re

1852
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,600
canonicalize our coordinates so that we're always in the same space.

1853
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,000
Now, the reason that we

1854
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,700
To do this instead of just having one floating Point.

1855
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,600
Coordinate, that tells us where we are is because I want to have giant

1856
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,100
tile maps and floating Point, Precision doesn't actually allow us to

1857
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:34,800
do that.

1858
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:37,000
We could use doubles instead.

1859
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,800
So everything would be 64 bit floating point, but there's platforms

1860
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,900
are doing, so, you have seen before.

1861
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,400
I don't even know the Raspberry Pi does 64-bit, floating-point.

1862
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,100
It might not.

1863
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,700
So euphoric floating point is slower.

1864
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,800
So I often times might want to do stuff where we put things into a

1865
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:50,800
floating Point spacers.

1866
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:54,200
There's a lot of reasons why I think we want to go within for tile and

1867
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,500
then floating-point offset.

1868
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,900
But you know, who knows?

1869
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,000
Maybe it's a bad decision.

1870
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,000
You don't always make all the right decisions and so we won't really

1871
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,400
know until the end of the day when it's all, when it all shakes out.

1872
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,700
With this kind of code, be a good fit for unit tests.

1873
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:16,700
Fuzz test to make sure strange Corner cases.

1874
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:17,600
Don't creep around.

1875
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:18,400
Yes.

1876
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,400
Probably.

1877
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,100
It depends on how well we can test to see what we actually want to

1878
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:24,500
see.

1879
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:31,100
But yes, like at least like for when we go to do like our flooring

1880
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:32,200
functions and all that sort of stuff.

1881
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,900
That's a excellent case.

1882
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:37,300
For when we could do unit testing, where we could just test lots of

1883
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,900
stuff to make sure our floor works and that sort of thing.

1884
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,600
So, I don't know exactly.

1885
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:46,000
If we where the line is drawn for that, but but yes, I mean some of

1886
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,300
these functions are small enough and well-defined enough that we could

1887
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,200
make unit tests for them and and might do that.

1888
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,200
But we don't want a unit test.

1889
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,500
These because again, these are our play functions.

1890
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,400
We want to test it once and we actually have the engine official

1891
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,900
functions were like, this is the one that we

1892
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,500
Ship, that's the one you test.

1893
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,400
Are there reasons why programmers of older adventure games?

1894
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,100
Chose to move the character around a map and not vice versa.

1895
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,400
It does.

1896
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,200
This have something to do with memory usage or render performance.

1897
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:26,500
You know, it's a little bit before my time, so I don't know.

1898
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,300
I suspect that it did have something to do with it.

1899
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,800
But a lot of those old systems did have ways that allow you to scroll

1900
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:40,600
a tile map.

1901
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,800
The reason we started off at ah, maps in the first place is because

1902
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,800
Hardware could display them specifically.

1903
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,800
Like, you could basically have the hardware have a set of tile lookups

1904
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,200
where you would put like a number in the tile map, like three.

1905
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,300
And it would know that corresponding to a certain 8 by 8, pixel thing

1906
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:58,900
or something.

1907
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,200
And so because processors back then we're

1908
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:06,600
Not nearly fast enough for you to actually draw your own actual tile

1909
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:06,900
map.

1910
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,200
That was totally not on the table.

1911
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,000
So they typically had in the old days.

1912
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,600
They had Sprites and tile Maps were actually part of the hardware.

1913
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,300
Like a hardware, could do some number of sprite overlays and it had a

1914
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:23,800
way of taking a map in memory that had indices and turning that into a

1915
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,500
tile map on the screen.

1916
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,400
So that's

1917
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,100
where those conventions came from.

1918
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,800
So I'm keeping some of those conventions.

1919
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,100
For our game, but I'm sort of relaxing the graphic one so that we can

1920
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,900
have a more modern looking game.

1921
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,200
But I like some of the aspects of tile Maps, because I think Tom apps

1922
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:44,800
are just interesting.

1923
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,200
In terms of people players, being able to understand what's possible

1924
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,600
on a tile map and being able to understand like Puzzles or doorways

1925
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:57,800
and stuff when things are totally, not when things are not aligned to

1926
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:58,500
a grid at all.

1927
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:02,100
It's much harder for the player to conceptualize what's possible and

1928
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,400
for puzzles to work.

1929
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:03,700
Well, because

1930
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,200
As you end up with these kind of Lucy physics, puzzles that don't feel

1931
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,800
very good and are typically very interesting.

1932
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,900
And so, you know, that's mostly where where we're going with it.

1933
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:36,000
Earlier, you said using const was ugly.

1934
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,700
Is that just a visual thing or is it ugly and some other way like

1935
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,000
performance coding style.

1936
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:45,400
So I like I said, I never have const bugs when I'm programming

1937
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,000
normally, so I never use const.

1938
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:54,100
But I was just noticing that this was a book that I had a bug here.

1939
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,500
I mean, I don't know if you'd want to call it a console, but it was a

1940
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,500
bug that like if you know, if you had kant's here.

1941
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,300
You wouldn't have been able to make the mistake, right?

1942
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,000
So I was thinking well, I don't know.

1943
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,200
Do I have to revisit that?

1944
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:11,700
Because am I going to be starting a my because of the way when I'm

1945
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,400
talking and stuff and I don't have my full attention will I start

1946
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,400
making constant bugs ones?

1947
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,700
That one didn't take any time to find but you could imagine if it was

1948
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:23,500
subtler bug, that would have cost a lot more.

1949
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,200
Maybe cost would have saved been worth it in the long run.

1950
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:33,600
The reason I said, it's ugly is because C++ makes constituting pretty

1951
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:35,300
ownerís.

1952
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,900
You end up with a lot of these problems of like kant's poisoning and

1953
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,800
all this other sorts of stuff.

1954
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,500
And it's just it's just an annoying thing to that you would never.

1955
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,500
There's no point in ever typing costs.

1956
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,800
You would never do that.

1957
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,700
You would never use const unless you thought you were going to save

1958
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,100
bugs by typing it.

1959
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:56,200
And so since I never saved bugs in my day-to-day, I don't ever type

1960
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:56,600
it.

1961
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,400
And so the only reason that I brought it up at all was just because I

1962
01:30:59,400 --> 01:30:59,900
was thinking.

1963
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:03,100
Well, alright, but programming on the stream is different than

1964
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:04,400
programming off the stream.

1965
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,700
So, you know.

1966
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,900
Do I have to adopt some coding practices that are different from the

1967
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:16,400
kinds that I would do normally day-to-day because, you know, I'm going

1968
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,200
to make different kinds of bugs.

1969
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,400
I already see myself, making a lot of typos bugs that I probably

1970
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,100
wouldn't be making in normal day.

1971
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:24,800
They coating as well.

1972
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,400
And so, you know, that's, that's sort of how that goes.

1973
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,300
Let's see.

1974
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:42,700
Think so.

1975
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,800
I guess we're out of time.

1976
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,100
Actually.

1977
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:46,500
Let me just see if there's any other questions that we should answer

1978
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:47,400
right now.

1979
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:49,900
Let's see.

1980
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,700
What's your preferred 2D coordinate system y going down or why going

1981
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:52,900
up?

1982
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,400
We talked about this yesterday a little bit.

1983
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,600
I actually would like to keep why going up.

1984
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,400
And so that's another change that we want to do.

1985
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,300
In fact, I should say, I forgot to leave the math friendly, comment in

1986
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:03,800
there.

1987
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,700
So I should put that more specifically so that we do this.

1988
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,000
Why should go up.

1989
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,900
Because we're going to make that change as well.

1990
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:14,800
That's when we actually go to the other.

1991
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,200
Tilemap.

1992
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,300
I want to make it so that y goes up so that we're sort of in line with

1993
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:19,800
math.

1994
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,900
Let's see.

1995
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,700
Sorry, I'm just scanning to see if there's anything else.

1996
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,900
So now that there's no raw at all.

1997
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:53,800
Can we rename canonical position to position and me canonicalize to

1998
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,700
fix a rebase?

1999
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,100
Yes, and I'll put it to you in to that effect.

2000
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,000
This.

2001
01:32:59,000 --> 01:32:59,700
This now can

2002
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:07,200
Be this can become World position for something similar will think

2003
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,500
about what we want to call that a little later on.

2004
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,600
But yes, because now we've just got one.

2005
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,800
We've done what we wanted to do.

2006
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Let's see.

2007
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,400
Will we be using the tile map for pathfinding or some other way to get

2008
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:28,800
smoother at movement, will probably use the tile map for pathfinding,

2009
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,300
because that will be the fastest way to generate the base path.

2010
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,000
But after we generate a base path through the tile map.

2011
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,400
We could make it smoother if we were unhappy with people.

2012
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,800
If we didn't want people kind of walking on the tile map, really Jank

2013
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:42,200
Ali.

2014
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,200
If that makes sense.

2015
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:54,700
Well, I released my version control system.

2016
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:57,100
It is the older version.

2017
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:59,100
That's kind of janky is still available.

2018
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:07,900
This is like a really old version of it, but it was pretty much still

2019
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,300
there.

2020
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,800
Yeah, Molly rocket.com 736.

2021
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:19,800
If you go to win32 Source, you can download a zip file and this was

2022
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,100
the old one that me and Sean Barrett had.

2023
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:28,000
Well, I made a version of it and then Shawn Barrett liked it and

2024
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:28,600
started using it.

2025
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,200
So he poured it to his standard library because it had some stuff that

2026
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,800
he wanted to use and so now it

2027
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,500
B1 file.

2028
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,200
Now, it's too.

2029
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,300
I think that's still probably a pretty good version.

2030
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:40,700
It's not great.

2031
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:46,100
I've got a more updated one, but I mostly, yeah, I've been doing some,

2032
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:46,900
it's a long story.

2033
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:49,500
I don't want to get into it, but point being, there is a version of

2034
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,100
the old one that's still available.

2035
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It's like the simplest version control system because that's what I

2036
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,900
really wanted.

2037
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,200
So it is there if people want to play with it.

2038
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,400
And again, it's an old version.

2039
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,500
But it is it is something I did release that on time ago.

2040
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:11,200
All right, I think that is basically it for today.

2041
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,400
Thank you very much.

2042
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:17,600
Everyone for joining me for another day of handmade hero coating.

2043
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,800
It has been a pleasure coding with you, as always, if you would like

2044
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,400
to get a copy of the source code.

2045
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:26,600
You can pre-order the game here on handmade hero to org and you will

2046
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,300
get your own very own links.

2047
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,800
You can download the source code every night after I am done

2048
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,400
programming with.

2049
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,300
It's a good way to follow along at home and it's got the source code

2050
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,100
for all the days.

2051
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:35,500
So you could

2052
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,900
So you go start all the way back at the very first video and it's got

2053
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:39,800
the source code from each day.

2054
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,000
And it's, you can follow along with that, too, which is kind of fun.

2055
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,500
If you're new to the stream.

2056
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,600
If you just want to spread the video series.

2057
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,900
We do have a patreon now that you can subscribe to their and we have a

2058
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:54,700
pretty awesome site where people gather on the news and forums.

2059
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,000
You can click on, it's got all kind of stuff.

2060
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,400
It has 2 schedules for the week.

2061
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,800
It's got an episode guide for catching up with old episodes.

2062
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,900
Great stuff on it.

2063
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:05,000
Cody resources where people have done ports to other operating systems

2064
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,700
already long before we ever going to get there.

2065
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,200
They did Linux and Mac ports.

2066
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,600
And someone did a port to Swift.

2067
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,300
It's crazy.

2068
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,700
And then there's also a forums if you can ask questions on and stuff

2069
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:16,300
like that.

2070
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,400
So please check it out.

2071
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,000
If you're looking to learn from the series.

2072
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,800
It's got a lot of great resources for you that I think you will really

2073
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,300
enjoy.

2074
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:25,800
So, thank you very much for joining me.

2075
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,200

01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:29,700
tomorrow.

2077
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,600
