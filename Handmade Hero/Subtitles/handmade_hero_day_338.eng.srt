00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,000
The show where we could complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,300
This is a second.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,500
Well, third day I guess of particles stuff that we are doing.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,200
We're just trying to like put in some particle system infrastructure

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,800
for ourselves to use so that we can start having particle systems that

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,900
actually are in the game proper.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,500
We did a long time ago, some test stuff with particle systems just to

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,100
kind of show literally test up.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,800
I guess I just did sort of an introductory.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
I think on those and now we like to make it so that they can be in the

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,900
game for reals not just as a little piece of test code to show how

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,500
they work.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,300
So I thought of something and I kind of wanted to mention it because I

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:57,500
was thinking that maybe it's something that we'll have to that is

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,700
Suggest that my Approach may not have been so good so far and that we

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,099
should maybe sort of reconsider us.

18
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,900
Think about it in the shower this morning as is often inevitable.

19
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,800
Oops, gotta restart that guy.

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,100
There we go.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,400
See today.

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,800
338.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,200
So,

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
This is basically like a particle.

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,500
Cash talk.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,200
So what I was thinking about is I was trying to think about what sorts

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,300
of things I wanted to enable guys kind of just idly thinking about

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,700
them.

29
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,600
And what I was realizing is that the way that I was structuring, the

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,600
particle cash was probably not really what I wanted.

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,400
And here is why so I had sort of been structuring the protocol cash as

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,200
if the main case that we were trying to handle was something like oh

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,600
you know here is like a little fountain or something and there's like

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,200
some water coming out of the fountain, right?

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:01,700
And

36
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,400
The fountain would be an entity and it would have a particle, you

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,100
know, system on it.

38
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
Wow.

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,600
Okay.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,100
A particle system on it.

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,500
And then what would happen is when this came on the screen there, the

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,100
particle system cache, would wake up and say, oh, okay, I need to like

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
have a particle system here for the fountain.

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Now that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,200
If what you're planning on is having a few discrete particle systems

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,800
around the screen, you know, that are doing whatever they're doing.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
But what I realized is that's not really the game that I'm making

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,600
here, I don't think that's really gonna hold up because let's suppose

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,300
that I want to do something like this where I've got you know trees

50
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,200
around here.

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,800
Right.

52
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,800
and I,

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Light one of these guys on fire and now there's fire spreading to all

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,500
these trees, right?

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,200
Well, I definitely don't want to create a different particle system

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
for each fire, right?

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Because you know it quickly would balloon out into way too many

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
particle systems especially if there were other particle systems

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,300
happening like wind or water or whatever happening.

60
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,300
And so what I was realizing as it's like well really, I think what we

61
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,700
probably want is to say that there's just a particle system.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Mm.

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,900
That's the full screen.

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,500
You know for fire and anything that's on fire responding, particle

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,100
system particles into that particle system so that we don't really

66
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
care how much fire spreads out throughout the world.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,900
We can always handle it and degrade more gracefully.

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,500
Then the problems that we would have, if we had to have each

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,100
individual.

70
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,400
One of these fires be a particle system now,

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,800
Right.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,700
So I think my Approach was just kind of fundamentally not great in

73
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,100
that sense, right?

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,600
and so, what I'm thinking is that actually,

75
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,500
We probably don't need the particle system cache at all.

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,900
Probably, I mean we we do need the particle system cache.

77
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,600
We just don't need it to let cash particle systems by entity ID or

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
anything like that.

79
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,500
Probably all we need to do is have entities spew particles into the

80
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,700
particle system if they're on fire, they just generate particle, fire

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,300
particles.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
And then the particles system takes care of remembering that and

83
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,800
handling those particles, right?

84
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,800
That's a much senior way to do it, and

85
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,200
Not sure why I wasn't going to do it that way in the first place.

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,900
Probably just, I didn't think it through enough for who knows why but

87
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,500
so I think the problem is actually a little bit simpler than what I

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
was thinking about to be.

89
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,400
Now, there is some

90
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,800
There is a little bit of a caveat here, which is that the particle

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,600
system is like going to be a fixed thing in space.

92
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,700
So as we move around, right, as we move, the particle system around

93
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,700
during each pass through the particle system, we have to displace the

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,300
particles by the camera because the product of them is just a fixed

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,000
thing over the screen.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,700
So if the player walks to the left and the camera is moving, then we

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
need to shift all the particles to coincide with that because the

98
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,500
particles themselves are never going to really be.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,700
In the world space, they're always kind of just in the local

100
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
simulation space.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
They never get stored back out or anything like that, right?

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,700
Okay.

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,300
But I think that's what we want.

104
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,100
I think that's just a smarter thing.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,700
And so I feel like we can just kind of eliminate that part of the code

106
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,900
that we had before, by the way, for those of you following along at

107
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,500
home today, is days is day 338.

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,700
So you want to use that.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,300
You want to use three 37's source code if you're trying to follow

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,700
along with me today, okay?

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,300
So essentially the particle system thing all of this stuff that we

112
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,700
were working on, can stay exactly the same, the difference.

113
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,100
Now is that these particles systems are not going to be things that

114
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,900
are based on some kind of a cash.

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,600
You know, they're going to be something based on on how many different

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,900
sort of discrete particle, simulation, re Arenas, we're going to need.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,600
Need.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
So at the moment we could just say that we just have one kind of

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
particle system and that's the fire system or something like that.

120
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,500
You don't need this and we don't need this and so because we're never

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,400
going to do any of that caching and we don't need the touching the

122
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
frame touching and that stuff.

123
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,700
So we can get rid of this, which is nice.

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,600
We can get rid of basically every thing that had to do with particle

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,200
systems, other than just the basic particle system piece itself that

126
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,300
we were kind of playing around with and yeah and the particle spec

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,700
would really be more of a particle emitter specification, kind of a

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,800
thing and we don't really even need

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,700
That to be in there anymore.

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,900
Now, let's go ahead.

131
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,600
And that also means we can unwind one of kind of the, the stupid

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,200
things, The Entity ID, B, we had to move in order to make that work.

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,600
We can also unwind that and put that back in here, I believe that

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,900
should work just fine least, I think so.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,100
And so the protocol system specs stuff can go away temporarily and

136
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,300
we'll continue on.

137
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,100
All right.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
So, let's see what we've got here.

139
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,300
All of this stuff I guess is still the same because this is just

140
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,700
operating on particle systems.

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not operating on the particle system cache, anything, that's

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
operating the process from cash.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
However, is going to have to change.

144
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,800
Get a create particle.

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,100
System is never going to be something that we need to do again.

146
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
So, in theory, all of this stuff can just go away, right?

147
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,900
I think we can just say, you know what?

148
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,800
That is just a completely unnecessary.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,300
So is touch particle system.

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,700
Those are just not things anymore.

151
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,500
So, early, it's only update and render particle systems.

152
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,600
And really, this time for the

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,900
Under part of systems.

154
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,200
We would just, I think we've got one here, whatever.

155
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
Yeah, we've got that play around thing, really.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,600
We do update and render fire.

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,100
Let's say, so if we've got update your render fire.

158
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,900
I'm just going to go ahead and here and say, like, okay, for updated

159
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,400
render fire, we'll just call that in here.

160
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,900
This stuff is not necessary anymore.

161
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
And we can just say what is that?

162
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,299
Fire system?

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
And that will have everything that it needs to work with when we do in

164
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,100
it, the particle cash.

165
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,000
Again, that's something that we don't really have to worry about too

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,600
much.

167
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,400
We want all our particles, probably initialized to zero so I at least

168
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,200
our or do we, I don't really know.

169
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,300
That's a good question, probably we do.

170
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,600
Which in that case, I think that does mean we could have left the

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,800
right clear in for our particle system.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Was in which case we don't really need a particle cash.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,500
Really, for anything.

174
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,600
I have to think about that.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,400
We can leave the call in, but I just don't know that it actually

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,500
matters at all.

177
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,400
But yeah, when we do this World's truck and we do the no clear, I

178
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,500
guess what I could do is as you're I could just clear it here for now

179
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,900
and then if we don't if we decide that we don't need to clear it

180
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,800
later, we can eliminate that call.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,600
So yeah, let's take a look at the rest of the stuff.

182
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,700
The particle spec for an IT product system and it particle system is

183
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,800
not going to happen anymore.

184
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,100
It would be per parts.

185
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,300
We actually did need to do some insulation which we don't update and

186
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,700
render.

187
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,100
Fire needs to take some entropy

188
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,500
At the moment, we don't have any entropy so we probably want to use to

189
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,600
have the cash, have its own entropy Source, I would imagine.

190
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
So something like this random series entropy

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:07,500
And that entropy is not gameplay sensitive at the moment.

192
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:16,800
So this is, you know effects such or particle entropy note, Casey not

193
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
we're gameplay.

194
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,400
Ever.

195
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,200
Right, because that's just some go behind my head there.

196
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,000
So, yeah, we want to, when we initialize this, I guess there's

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,300
something.

198
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,700
We can do.

199
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,100
That's initialization based.

200
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,500
So particle entropy I don't know what random Series has in.

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,600
It probably it's got like a seed or something like this.

202
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,300
Do we know, do we know?

203
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,800
How to seed one of these guys.

204
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,800
Let's see, random, see, there it is.

205
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,300
So we just want a random seed the sky without a 1, 2 3 4 or 4.

206
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,600
Now it doesn't matter.

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,600
We just need to get entropy from somewhere.

208
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
So once we have some entropy then we will just say okay you can use

209
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,500
our entropy system and go to town on that function does not take four

210
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
arguments well why don't you tell me how many it does take?

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,300
It takes a system and entropy in a DT, so it doesn't take a render

212
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,100
group yet.

213
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,400
It will, I would think, but we won't pass it yet.

214
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,900
If it doesn't want it, that's fine with me.

215
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,000
so,

216
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,300
moving on.

217
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
This comes after, yes.

218
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, so now this thing doesn't have to do anything.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,700
The particle system stuff doesn't have to get packed or unpacked and

220
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,200
then I think we're good to go.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
So this is all fine.

222
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Now,

223
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Aw.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,900
That's odd.

225
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,800
This is slower than it should be.

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,200
Is update and render fire, actually, that much work.

227
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,900
Let's find out.

228
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,200
That was not what I wanted.

229
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,400
Look at that.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
Why is that so slow?

231
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
It's not really doing very much.

232
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:03,100
It is it I guess our little experiment with the sliced.

233
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,700
With, with those sort of ways of doing Expressions, is not very good,

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
right?

235
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
Remember I was kind of playing with how can we write something that's

236
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:23,200
like friendly in terms of what it says Cindy wise and looks like,

237
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,900
that's not so useful because you can look at how much that is.

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,900
We could see if it actually, if it does the right thing in

239
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,600
Release mode.

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
But definitely doesn't do the right thing.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,300
And

242
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,300
In not in release mode.

243
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
Now, it's just awful.

244
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,100
Interesting.

245
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,600
So I guess my little trick is not not particularly good, or at least

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,900
it took his ring, unless I'm missing something, but it looks like it's

247
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,200
not particularly good because remember, I was sort of playing around

248
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,300
with.

249
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Can we write these things as math functions?

250
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,500
And it does not look like you can unless I'm missing something.

251
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,100
So yeah, maybe that wasn't so good.

252
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,900
I don't know.

253
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,200
I guess what we could do is say put off the 70 until we're done and

254
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,100
then Cindy eyes it.

255
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,300
Because I was kind of hoping it could just run in Cindy in general,

256
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,400
and we could just have some way of writing the math functions.

257
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:34,300
Kind of relatively cleanly, but I don't know if that's plausible at

258
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,100
the moment.

259
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,700
If that really is the case now, maybe it's something else that's going

260
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,800
on wrong here.

261
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,800
But, you know, assuming it's not

262
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
That's not great.

263
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,500
So

264
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
So, what do we want to do?

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,200
You know, what do we want to do here?

266
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,700
How do we want to tackle this?

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Do we want to write this in in non 71st, and then Cindy eyes it later,

268
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,500
or do we want to try?

269
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,700
Writing it in Cindy from the start and keep it relatively fast as we

270
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,200
go?

271
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,800
I really don't know.

272
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,200
I mean, what I want to do is be able to just write this in a nice

273
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
concise fashion, that then can be turned into Cindy code because it's

274
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
obvious how to turn to Cindy code.

275
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,600
Like, it's not.

276
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,900
There's nothing subtle about this.

277
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,000
This particle code.

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm literally just asking it to do for of the same op on an array all

279
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,100
the time.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
I just can't think of a good way to do something.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,400
Other than what I did that isn't super slot like sort of difficultly,

282
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,100
sloppy.

283
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,300
Let's think about this.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,600
So I guess one thing we could do, if we don't particularly care about

285
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,900
how wide we go, like if we don't want to go arbitrarily wide, we could

286
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,000
do something else.

287
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,600
So, let's think about this.

288
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,900
So one thing we could do is we could say well alright we've got these,

289
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,600
you know, these guys here that are sort of these sliceable guys who

290
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,000
have an ex-wife who have like a four of each for X is 4 Y is and for

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,300
Z's in them and what we could do is say like all right you know maybe

292
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,200
we've got a particle is actually for particles or something and we

293
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,200
just have a V3 for X you know of pv3 4X HD.

294
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,000
P.

295
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,500
You know, so it's the same as it was before but just everything is 4X

296
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:06,900
now.

297
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,700
Oops.

298
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,000
Right.

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,800
And so then, you know, a particle system is just a particle 4X.

300
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,900
and there's, you know,

301
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,400
A quarter.

302
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,700
The number of particle 4X is as we want protocols, you know, and off

303
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,800
we go, right?

304
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,400
And then this thing goes away.

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Like we don't need that anymore and we just had these guys that

306
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,000
operate on the bundles of four at once.

307
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,700
Right.

308
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,600
so, you know, if we did something like that,

309
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,200
This either.

310
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,400
So if you did something like that, we could maybe start to get things

311
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,800
into slightly better shape.

312
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,300
We would not need get particle right, that would not happen anymore.

313
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,700
And in here, what we could do is say like, all right, you know, we've

314
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,800
got a particle a and that particle, a is just whatever the particle

315
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,000
that we're supposed to be on.

316
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,500
because that's a, i

317
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,100
So now we've got a pointer and then from there we can just say like

318
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,900
okay we want to initialize all these guys and we can do that exactly

319
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
the same way, right?

320
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,800
So, the code looks almost identical.

321
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,600
If we look at it, right?

322
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,700
And now, you know, the hope is anyway, the this will be much more easy

323
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,500
for the compiler to understand what we're doing.

324
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,600
It's not all like super contorted like it was before.

325
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,300
So the hope is, you know, maybe that would take the pressure off it

326
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,400
and allow it to work.

327
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,900
I don't actually know, but that would be the Hope what is this

328
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,200
particle?

329
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,900
4X.

330
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,600
Does not have an over.

331
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,900
All right, these are dots.

332
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,500
So again.

333
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,200
just pull one of these out, and

334
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,300
I think.

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,500
This would be.

336
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
A lot nicer to look.

337
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,500
That looks a lot nicer too.

338
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,600
So I think all we have to do is add the plus equals operator in there

339
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,000
because we never did one of those.

340
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,300
We had done that for the particle V3 but we've never done a plus

341
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,100
equals 4.

342
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Just the 4X in the 3x guys so if I just go ahead and do that one.

343
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,300
Where are the?

344
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,800
The 4X ones.

345
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,600
We haven't done yet.

346
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
All right, let's just say where are the for excellence?

347
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,600
So if we do a plus equals for this guy,

348
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,300
we should be able to just kind of

349
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,300
Do this in place, like so.

350
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,100
And I think that's it.

351
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,100
We're still in.

352
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,400
Sterling.

353
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,900
Optimize mode.

354
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,400
I didn't actually want it to be an optimism.

355
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,500
It's let's see how we do.

356
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,300
So you can see how like, like, basically we were doing exactly the

357
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,800
same mathematical operations, right?

358
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,600
We did we have not changed any of the math but just the compiler.

359
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Could not figure out the kind of machination of you're doing there.

360
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,500
So this is a lot nicer.

361
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,500
Now we've actually gotten rid of the things that it probably thought

362
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,400
it had to do to make things work.

363
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,900
Okay.

364
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,800
And so that's a lot happier right now.

365
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,300
It's a completely meaningless part and it runs just fine which is what

366
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,500
I would have.

367
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,200
Acted.

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,600
All right.

369
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,400
So yeah, do we need this anymore?

370
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,000
No.

371
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,400
So, yeah, so that's a lot nicer, I think because now, we now we

372
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,700
effectively have the ability to treat a particle as a mathematical,

373
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,600
like, you know, in fix notation thing that we can actually read.

374
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:31,000
You know, I can read this a lot better and I feel like that's going to

375
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,100
be important if we want to actually keep it in Cindy the whole time.

376
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,000
So it's, you know, a debug mode, Still Still fast enough.

377
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,100
I think that's just a better way to go.

378
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,200
So, yeah, so let's add the stuff that we're missing here.

379
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,500
I'm going to go ahead and get rid of if because in Cindy, that's gonna

380
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,000
be a little tricky.

381
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
So we'll have to see how we want to do that.

382
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:53,900
Exactly.

383
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,400
But,

384
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Then we can kind of move on to working on some of these other things.

385
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Okay, so I think that's that we should now have to write these

386
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,000
operators.

387
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,600
The ones that we wrote, we should have to write them for the V3 V4,

388
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,500
and that sort of stuff.

389
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:19,000
So really I think all that is is just, you know, changing these guys

390
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
to v4s

391
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,300
I am just adding the w.

392
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,400
That's really it.

393
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,600
And again, if you're a template sort of person, this is possibly a

394
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,900
place you could use those.

395
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,000
Or things like that.

396
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,100
If you have some way of accessing generic programming in your

397
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,700
language, that doesn't make you want to throw yourself in front of a

398
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,000
bus like C++ has.

399
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,200
Does this would be a good time to maybe break that up.

400
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,700
So, yeah, let's see.

401
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,200
Oh right.

402
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,000
These are labeled slightly differently.

403
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,400
Just to make things easier on myself.

404
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,200
I'm going to go ahead and Anonymous Union.

405
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
These guys.

406
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,900
Right.

407
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
So that way I can access them as either one.

408
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,500
and now,

409
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,000
Still good.

410
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,500
No worries.

411
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,600
So now we're doing part of the updating that we wanted to do for our

412
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,500
particle systems.

413
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,900
The old essentially the old particle code is now symbolized and

414
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,300
Like I was saying before it seems like we can we can do this pretty

415
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,000
easily.

416
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Like this this looks like the kind of thing where I can leave it in

417
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,400
this code and I don't really have to worry too much about it.

418
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,500
I can also now that we've got this sort of a little bit more under

419
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,300
control, I could say like, all right, instead of a, I can actually

420
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,100
make this be called what it actually is.

421
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,400
So we kind of know roughly what we're doing here and everything else

422
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,300
here, I think is fine.

423
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,200
So, that's all good as well.

424
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,400
All right.

425
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
Um, so yeah.

426
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,000
So I'm reasonably happy with how that turned out.

427
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,500
This is kind of one of those things at least, hopefully it's

428
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,900
relatively self-evident from

429
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Yep, if you just take a look at what happened in the past 15 minutes

430
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,600
or so, I feel like that's just a good example if in case, it wasn't

431
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,700
obvious of why it's important to actually like do all the things that

432
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,900
we talked about doing on the stream, right?

433
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,700
First of all, the fact that I had heads-up profiling on, there was the

434
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,200
thing that let me know that we were slow right away, right?

435
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,500
Because I never would have known how busted that code was till later.

436
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
When I went to try and actually performance optimized it or figure out

437
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,900
why my game was slow, who knows where down the road, but because we

438
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,400
always have our heads up stuff running.

439
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,600
We know the instant something is taking more time than we think it

440
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,900
should be.

441
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,100
It's like what's going on, right?

442
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,500
And we can jump right to it and see like okay, this thing is, is not

443
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,000
performing the way we want, right?

444
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:12,000
So again, I think we talked about that way back when people were

445
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,200
asking.

446
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,300
Like, you know, why do you spend time with debug stuff before you

447
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,900
actually need it?

448
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,700
It's because deep part of the debug code is about knowing when things

449
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,000
are broken and you don't necessarily always know when things are

450
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,500
broken, you know?

451
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,900
I mean, even just a something as simple as a

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,200
I'm rate counter where you can kind of look at how many milliseconds

453
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,400
per frame.

454
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,800
You're taking is incredibly important to always have available because

455
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,600
otherwise, you just never have any idea what your changes are really

456
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,000
doing.

457
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
It's very hard to perceive them unless they slow down things.

458
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,900
So obviously that you can't not see it, right?

459
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,700
So, so there's that.

460
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,400
And the other thing is, if you look at the difference between how much

461
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,900
cleaner this code looks than if we were to write it by hand, and

462
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,400
D or even it even looks better than what we had before.

463
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,900
The kind of clunky version that just kind of underscores like how

464
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,300
important it is to just actually take the time to figure out how to

465
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,700
get something a little bit more right before you start writing a ton

466
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,700
of stuff in it because, you know, we could have easily gone down that

467
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,700
route and had the much uglier looking code and then it just would have

468
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,000
been this constantly compounding problem where it's now all the work

469
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,800
we do on the particles, will go and be pretty

470
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,300
Easy to read and we know that it's relatively efficient.

471
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,700
So, you know, we're really set up for Success there in a good way.

472
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,900
So that's what I would say about that.

473
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,300
That's all I would say about that.

474
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,400
Anyway, so now let's take a look at what we would want to do here for

475
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,500
rendering before I get into.

476
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,300
Whether we want to start playing with some of this other stuff.

477
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,500
We got to do a few more things here where we figure out what we want

478
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,700
to do with rendering and we also have to take care of that

479
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,700
displacement thing that I was talking about before.

480
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,800
So essentially what's got to happen, here is whenever we do an update

481
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
and render of anything.

482
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,600
Basically, we have to pass both the DT and we will have to

483
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,000
Additionally, a frame displacement, right?

484
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,200
So we need essentially a vector.

485
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:29,100
That is the thing that we need to displace all the particles by to

486
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,600
handle the offset from the camera.

487
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,700
Now I won't actually do that yet.

488
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,100
I'll leave it out so that you can see what happens when it's not

489
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,900
there, but we'll just have to remember, I'm just going to put it in so

490
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,100
we know that it's there, right?

491
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,600
So when we update the position,

492
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,000
We're just going to put in frame.

493
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,600
Displacement in there.

494
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,300
And then when we do update render fire, we'll just have frame.

495
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,200
Displacement be this thing that we sort of have in there that we

496
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,900
haven't done yet.

497
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,500
There we go.

498
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm not move over here so I'm not cramping my style there and it just

499
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,800
won't do this placement yet.

500
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,600
So we'll still be able to see the bug that will happen if we don't do

501
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,200
the frame displacement and then we can put in the frame because this

502
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,800
fancy it.

503
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,900
So I don't want to like Jump Ahead there but I just happen to know

504
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,200
right?

505
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,400
That you know if we don't have that displacement, it's going to mess

506
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,800
this up.

507
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Okay, so

508
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
we've got updated Enterprise systems.

509
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,500
Passing that displacement, not going to do anything yet, but we've got

510
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,100
it in there.

511
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,200
So what we need before, we can actually see anything happening here is

512
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400
oh, and by the way,

513
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,500
That's got to be lofted.

514
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,900
Probably this.

515
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
So what we need is just some function.

516
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,200
That can produce these.

517
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,700
From a input.

518
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,600
So if I have a 3 V 3 for X as the result, I just want to result to be.

519
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,300
Replicating, whatever the input was four times, right?

520
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,100
So I'm just trying to stuff the values like so.

521
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Frame displacement.

522
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,000
Let me spell it, right and off we go.

523
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,900
So the thing that we have not addressed yet now is the rendering.

524
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,500
So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm just going to render

525
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,300
these particles through the standard particle path.

526
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Obviously, the standard particle path is probably not what we want.

527
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,500
It's going to be too slow, I talked about why.

528
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,300
So we're going to want to go ahead and add a special path for a

529
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,200
particles or something.

530
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,400
We've got a lot of ways we get attack, tackle, the problem certainly,

531
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,700
but I think we're going to want a standard way.

532
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,900
That's, it's not really for particles per se, but just for things that

533
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,600
render out of the same bitmap, lots of things rendering out of the

534
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,700
same texture.

535
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,900
Basically, we want to have a path for that process.

536
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,100
Okay, so now we could take a look at this and say, all right, we need

537
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:51,400
a color here and and we need to push bitmap calls, and positions.

538
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,000
And so on, obviously we can't really do those things because we've got

539
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,800
four packed of these.

540
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,800
So what we really need to do is

541
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,400
So we have a way of actually producing, like I said, that optimize

542
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,000
buffer, we're going to have to go through, you know, each of the sub

543
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,100
particles, right?

544
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,000
So this is like in that pack of four, we got to go through all four

545
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,900
and pull them out separately, right?

546
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,000
So what we need to do first is we need to find the the P value.

547
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,100
And then we need to find the color value.

548
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
So each of these

549
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,800
For the entity transform, this should just be something that we don't

550
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,900
really have to worry about that.

551
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,900
Will just be some transform for the basis of the particle system

552
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,600
itself.

553
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,700
So that's actually something that I assume can be passed in.

554
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
And just left set the entire time.

555
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,800
Now, the bitmap ID is something that we don't really have yet.

556
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,300
We're going to have to get that from somewhere for now.

557
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,300
I think we'll use the same trick we used before which is to say we can

558
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,199
use the head of the of the hero.

559
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,900
And so when we do our in it protocol cash will kind of do some stuff

560
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,699
here for that.

561
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,600
So what I'll do is say, probably I guess what I've said what I do is

562
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,500
say, Let's Pretend for now, the particle systems have a bitmap

563
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,400
ID, that is, whatever the bitmap that they use.

564
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,600
And we'll just say that you always have that available.

565
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,400
We'll have to get that from somewhere, but we'll cross that bridge

566
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,199
when we come to it.

567
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,699
So to say, use the system ID, the particle transform.

568
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's just going to be something that is pretty much constant I think

569
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,400
so it could be passed in here.

570
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,699
I don't know if we need to pass it in here.

571
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:56,800
We could also put it in here but I'm just not sure about that yet.

572
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,800
So I'm going to go ahead and take a look.

573
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,000
At how our transforms are generally created here, we want sort of

574
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,600
vanilla transform so I think probably the default upright transform

575
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,400
would be the easiest transform to do.

576
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,900
If we want its temp centered around the camera.

577
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,200
We would want to do this.

578
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,900
We'd want to do we want to do that as well, because that's sort of

579
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,100
like where the Sim Center is versus where the camera is because the

580
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,800
Sim Center and the camera Center I guess are not always the same.

581
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,300
I don't really know why we do that.

582
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,100
I'd have to think about why we do that.

583
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,300
I think we may snap the Sim Center to always be aligned to a floor

584
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,500
boundary whereas the camera can sort of move separately, right?

585
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm not sure about that though.

586
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Don't quote me on that.

587
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,200
So anyway and of course what I say

588
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,300
Don't quote me on that.

589
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,500
I think we actually have a quote database so it's kind of a bad thing

590
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,200
that I say, don't quote me on that because someone could be quoting me

591
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,500
on what I said.

592
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
Not to quote me on that.

593
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,200
Which is not great if that makes sense.

594
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
So yeah let's take a look.

595
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,800
What I want to do is say the default upright transfer, and let's say

596
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
maybe that's just what we use here.

597
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,500
And so we'll just say that there's a particle transform in here.

598
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,000
For the particle system and pretty much.

599
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,300
Those will probably just be set and forgotten because they probably

600
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,500
never need to change.

601
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,300
But if we want to do something Fancy with them later, we can.

602
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So I think we want to do something that's actually does that when we

603
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
push these bitmaps on here.

604
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,500
Now what we're going to have to do is we're going to take those pieces

605
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,300
out like I said.

606
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,100
So we're going to have to do something where we say, like, okay, let's

607
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,600
pretend that we're grabbing out individual pieces here.

608
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,900
So like rv3 is going to be

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Kind of a nasty way to get this.

610
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:58,000
It's going to be something like a px, you know, the can't even

611
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,500
remember what these things.

612
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,400
See here.

613
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
Let me see.

614
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,200
I don't know where our particle systems code is.

615
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,700
It's not loaded yet updating render fire.

616
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
So I want to know.

617
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,200
How I access the individual members.

618
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,600
And I never remember because of the weirdest names.

619
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,200
Okay, so it's m120 underscore F 32.

620
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
All right, so you can see what I'm doing here.

621
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,500
I'm just plucking out those values.

622
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,800
Again, we don't really want to be doing this but we're just doing this

623
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,600
so that we can use the standard render path first, get the particle

624
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,800
systems working with that.

625
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
And then what we'll do after we have the particle systems.

626
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,300
Working with that is we'll go ahead and add a custom pipeline for

627
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,300
getting the particle systems down to the card in a way that isn't too

628
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,500
heinous, right?

629
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,000
So that's what we need to do at the moment, so I think that would do

630
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,500
it.

631
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,100
Let's

632
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,700
get this back in here.

633
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,200
Good?

634
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,400
I don't know why object transform isn't defined yet.

635
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Is that

636
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,100
is that not a thing?

637
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,600
Is that included, our particle system somehow included before the

638
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,200
renderer.

639
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
There's object transform and I don't know why the particle systems

640
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,300
would be well, let's find out.

641
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Yeah, they sure are.

642
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,100
I wonder if we can move them after.

643
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
That's not a problem because that's just a pointer.

644
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,500
So I think that's all good.

645
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,900
None of the to overloads.

646
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,300
Well yeah, duh.

647
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Okay.

648
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,800
So now that we're in here, we need to pass the render group Mast.

649
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,700
It's actually taking it like, we knew it would but we've never had it

650
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,200
in there before.

651
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,600
When we knit the part of a cache, we now have to make sure that our

652
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:14,000
fire system, it has to have a transform.

653
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,700
That's the default.

654
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,900
Upright, transform for now, I guess.

655
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,400
And

656
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,200
and yeah, and the

657
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,800
Bitmap ID will have to get from somewhere.

658
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,700
Now, I don't actually know.

659
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,400
We're going to get the bit by D from I guess I'll probably pass

660
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,400
something here to the product system.

661
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,200
So it can do some queries and and get one, you know,

662
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,500
We'll see if we can do that.

663
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,400
The Entity actually, no, it would be World mode.

664
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,100
So when we do add player Somewhere In Here, We Do.

665
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,300
Queries for this.

666
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,600
So here, we've got asset Shadow torso, Cape Ed.

667
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
So, I guess what?

668
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,100
We do the pieces, we actually call them out at that time, which I

669
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,000
guess is good.

670
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,300
So, if you want to do that, how would we do that?

671
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,900
Let's see, let's see.

672
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,500
Where's our peace iterator?

673
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,200
There it is.

674
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:37,900
So yeah, if we want to do that, we get this guy.

675
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Of course we don't really have anything to match on because you don't

676
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,400
have any assets for this but it's okay.

677
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,500
We could pretend and get the hero head or something like we were doing

678
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,900
before, that seems fine.

679
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,100
So if we did that we could just say like okay let's just get like

680
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,000
asset type you know or

681
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What was it again?

682
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,500
Acid head.

683
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,200
So, we'll just get some head out of here.

684
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
And call it a day.

685
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,700
Now I don't actually know if that's everything we need because I don't

686
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,200
remember.

687
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,100
But either way we would have to pass the asset system here.

688
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,000
Because without it it would not be able to get any of that.

689
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,300
Now, I don't know if the asset system has been loaded, it would all

690
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,000
would have to be.

691
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,500
So the asset systems are always loaded at that point.

692
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,000
So I think we're in luck there, that's just easy enough.

693
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,800
We don't have to worry about the initialization order of those things.

694
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
They'll just work.

695
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,500
Okay, so now we need to do some oh dear.

696
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,200
Oh God.

697
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,800
All right.

698
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,600
Well.

699
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,400
Yeah.

700
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,900
That's going to cause a problem.

701
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,400
I had not thought about that.

702
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,300
This.

703
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,100
I wonder if this is finally the straw that breaks the camel's back and

704
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,700
forces us to see before our stuff which we've constantly tried to

705
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,500
avoid but

706
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
That's going to be a tough one to think through.

707
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,700
So yeah, if we push this many things into the sort graph, it's going

708
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,600
to be an epic nightmare, right?

709
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,000
I mean, we can get things working here with just a small number of

710
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,400
particles may be like that, but I had not considered the sort the sort

711
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,600
graph problem that we have.

712
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,900
So yeah, so now I think we are at least in theory generating

713
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,400
particles.

714
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,100
And now we have to just kind of go do the debugging to make sure

715
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,000
they're getting placed in a reasonable location and that we can

716
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,100
actually see them but but that's basically it.

717
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,800
How much time do I have?

718
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
I don't know.

719
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
I think we've got 15 minutes left.

720
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,100
I need a thing.

721
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,100
I need a way.

722
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,800
I should probably put a countdown timer in here, which is like, says,

723
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,300
how many minutes are left?

724
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,700
Because I don't actually know, I don't remember, we started, I think

725
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:49,200
we did a start and 8:45 start, which means we'd have 945 Switch

726
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,100
reviews, have 50 minutes.

727
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,600
So I'm going to just do some debugging here and we'll talk about that

728
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,200
problem that we're going to have.

729
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,600
Okay, so

730
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,400
Eight.

731
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,000
Handmade render noted.

732
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,000
Where's my particles?

733
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Why does this thing not leave things open?

734
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,700
I know, we've been in that file, like, can't I just tell it, like,

735
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,900
have all my stuff?

736
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,600
Why can't you just have all my buffers open?

737
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,900
Why can't you be more like for coder?

738
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,300
God.

739
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,300
Yeah, millions of dollars went into developing the software package

740
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,100
and I can't even do like basic for coder things, seriously.

741
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,800
All right.

742
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,300
So let's see.

743
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I need to do up to update and render fire.

744
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:53,000
So we need to take a look at what we are rendering.

745
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,900
And if it makes any sense.

746
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:10,200
Alright, so we have our rgba and our p-values, those all look fine.

747
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,400
So it may just be the case that we're just rendering in a place that

748
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:20,600
we can't currently see because it's too far below something else or

749
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,700
something like this.

750
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,800
I'm not sure.

751
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm going to take a quick look up at update and render world so I can

752
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,300
see what the camera location is.

753
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,300
Well, if the camera is it 000 though.

754
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,400
I would think.

755
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,900
That, that would have been sufficient.

756
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,200
Now, what I could do

757
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,200
I suppose is I could Nerf.

758
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,100
Everything else just so I can see.

759
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,800
If they're getting clipped by something else or not, let's take a look

760
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,100
here.

761
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,300
Okay, so yeah.

762
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,900
So our particles are doing their thing and so we're off to a good

763
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,200
start.

764
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,100
So all we really need to do now is actually sort of make these guys

765
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,700
spawn somewhere that we actually care.

766
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:31,700
And there.

767
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,700
And then we can, we can move on from there.

768
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,900
Kind of a nice little Twitchy head thing going on there.

769
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,700
My goodness.

770
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,100
All right.

771
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,400
So we've got updating render entities.

772
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:56,700
And really this this bit here I'm going to make into a function called

773
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,700
spawn fire.

774
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,200
And I'm going to go ahead and grab that up here and make it look like

775
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:05,700
that.

776
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,400
Spawn fire will take the particle system cash.

777
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,800
And it will get the fire system out of that cash.

778
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,800
And if we take a look at the P values here, what I want to do is say

779
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,300
like okay we're not going to touching the stuff yet and it's not fire.

780
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,800
Anyway, it's just, it's a stream of heads.

781
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,600
But what we do want to do there when we spawn the fires say like,

782
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,300
okay, we would like to tell it where where we were going to spawn it.

783
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,500
and then what I can do is Loft that guy up so I can say like okay,

784
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:16,400
after we compute that initial starting P, we can just add in our at

785
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,900
All right, so now we can spawn fire at a at a location.

786
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,400
We still need our entropy, but the entropy is easy to come by.

787
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,200
Oops.

788
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,900
So that should basically be it, right?

789
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,900
Oops, cash, not system.

790
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,500
So now we should be able to spawn fire wherever we want to spawn fire.

791
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,600
And so what I can do is I can say like okay let's say that there's an

792
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,000
entity that just spawn some fire, I don't know what, you know,

793
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,600
whatever.

794
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:13,600
So if we've got an entity here and maybe like if an entity is in its

795
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,000
Landing phase, you know?

796
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Whenever it lands, it, spawned some fire.

797
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,200
Why does this bonfire?

798
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:18,800
I don't know.

799
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,200
That's not my job.

800
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,700
I'm not a game designer.

801
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,700
I'm just a program.

802
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,300
And I decided that it's got a sponsor fire so it's going to spawn it.

803
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:32,900
Wherever the entities placement is at that particular point in time

804
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,700
and then it just needs to be able to get to the cash which I believe

805
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,300
it can do because I think we've got that in here.

806
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,200
Sorry part of the cash.

807
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,400
So you know in theory

808
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,200
I think we should be able to get that spawning.

809
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,500
A crisis.

810
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:57,700
I say that I am not seeing any spawning occur, but I'm not sure why.

811
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,500
I would like to know.

812
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,100
The heroes location is the moment.

813
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,900
and I would like to know,

814
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,600
What are particles systems looking like?

815
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,300
Kind of looks like it should be.

816
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:33,600
Okay.

817
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,800
I'm also going to, you know, what else?

818
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,600
I need to do here.

819
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,200
To make this a little easier on us.

820
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,300
I got to get rid of the rooms.

821
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,400
So we're only looking at one room.

822
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,600
All right.

823
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Okay.

824
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,400
So it was just the problem is just that we have too many particles

825
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,500
being spawned, so it's working just fine.

826
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,600
This is why we need a lot more in 64 particles.

827
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,900
So anyway that's all well and good.

828
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,600
And so now these people are spawning just fine now, of course we still

829
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,900
have a problem and that is as we move the camera, this will not work

830
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,300
properly.

831
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:26,500
Right?

832
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,000
Because all of these can these things are camera relative.

833
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,600
And so what I need to do is I need a way of moving the camera to the

834
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,300
side quickly.

835
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,800
So, what I want to do is make it so that the the door direction is

836
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:42,900
going

837
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,500
Be in line with us and there's two screens like so.

838
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,100
And then I'm going to update the particle, count a little bit just so

839
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:51,900
we can see more.

840
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,200
Right.

841
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,700
So we've got all these particles here, and they're all doing their

842
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,600
thing, or whatever has to happen, right?

843
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,200
You can see them and you see what happened there.

844
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:16,200
All of them, kind of stay in place even after you try to leave, right?

845
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,300
It's not pretty.

846
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,700
Now, of course, we kind of have to do something.

847
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,100
We have to have these particles, stay around a lot longer and of

848
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,300
course, like I said, we can't because our sir craft will explode, at

849
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,400
least I assume it will like you can see like look at that.

850
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,700
It's just a nightmare because they're all overlapping is the problem,

851
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:50,600
right?

852
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,700
But anyway, you can see how that kind of is a complete disaster there.

853
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,200
Yes, yes.

854
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,700
I know.

855
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,400
That looks like that.

856
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,800
Looks like a separate problem.

857
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,400
Why are we?

858
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,900
What's happening there?

859
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,700
Why is there?

860
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,000
Why are there two doors like that?

861
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,600
Shouldn't there only be one door.

862
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,400
Well.

863
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,500
Oh because it's okay.

864
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,400
No there's always going to be a next yet, never mind I'm stupid.

865
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:39,800
Never mind.

866
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,300
Forget it.

867
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,300
Anyway so this is all I wanted to get at here was these guys as they

868
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,000
kind of get sprayed up into the sky like that.

869
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,300
You can see the particles just they stay in one place when I move.

870
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,500
And that's because all of these particles are existing only in screen

871
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:00,100
space or not actually existing in World space, which is what we want.

872
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,200
Because we only want to be dealing with particles that are kind of

873
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,300
local to the simulation.

874
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:04,400
Really

875
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,600
And so that's great actually but we need some way of not having that

876
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,100
artifact.

877
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,800
As we kind of go from screen to screen or do any other kind of smooth

878
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
scrolling effect.

879
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,100
We don't want to have that happen.

880
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
So if we want to fix that, what we need to do is from one frame to the

881
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,800
next frame, we need to remember where the camera was and then account

882
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,200
for that shift by moving the particles by, whatever that change,

883
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,800
whatever that actual change in World space is right.

884
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,300
So somebody

885
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,800
Has to pass us essentially when we do update render particle systems,

886
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
somebody asked to pass us the frame displacement in from outside.

887
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,600
So when we call that in here, we need to get

888
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,900
The like frame-to-frame.

889
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,100
Camera.

890
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,600
Like the Delta, right?

891
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,600
So we have to get that summer.

892
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,600
So what we need to do is figure out sort of, we want to do a

893
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,000
subtraction of where the camera was last time and where the camera was

894
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,400
this time, right?

895
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,200
And so if you imagine how we would do that, we would just need to say

896
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,100
something like well.

897
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,700
Okay you know on the first frame we just wouldn't have any

898
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:24,200
displacement but and every frame there after we'd want to take base of

899
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,200
where the camera like was and do that diff right.

900
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,400
And so to do that,

901
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,000
All I'm really going to do is say well, okay, let's say there is a

902
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,100
last camera, pee.

903
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,600
And so, all I'm going to do is say, well, when we do, when we get that

904
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,800
camera p and that gets updated.

905
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:43,600
Right?

906
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,400
Let's see, your camera.

907
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,500
So we do begin soon.

908
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,600
So yeah, here we go.

909
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
So what we do in Simcoe

910
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Are right?

911
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,200
This is where the camera P would actually get updated.

912
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,900
I believe.

913
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,500
So when we have World mode camera P here, where we can, we get the SIM

914
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,900
Center out of this and the robot camera P.

915
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,300
At this point, what I want to do is say, okay, take the last camera p

916
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,800
and do the diff right?

917
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,300
So, frame to frame.

918
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,400
Camera, Delta p is going to be subtract and it's going to be the world

919
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,400
mode camera p.

920
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,300
And the world mode last camera, pee.

921
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,600
And then after I've done that, I want to do World mode.

922
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,000
Last camera, P equals World mode camera P.

923
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,600
So we can just do that suspect get the got the frame to frame Delta

924
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,200
and be done with it, right?

925
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,100
So now we have to do is make sure that when we actually initialize

926
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:55,700
things and we set it up the first time that we also set.

927
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,900
Last camera P to that value.

928
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,600
Alright, so off we go with our little particles, they're doing,

929
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,600
whatever it is that they're doing.

930
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,500
I wanted this to be landing and I accidentally set it to hopping.

931
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:24,300
It looks like, but now we need to do is get the that camera, Delta

932
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,700
working for frame to frame.

933
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,900
That's still in that.

934
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,100
That's not at all what I wanted.

935
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,600
To say the least.

936
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,500
So I believe we have an error here somewhere.

937
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,000
Of course, let me verify that we're actually using properly but it

938
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,200
didn't, it was not very complicated.

939
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,400
So I'm assuming I just have an error.

940
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,000
When Computing, the actual frame displacement but

941
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,100
when we take the finished basement with Place, pass it through,

942
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,100
and whenever we have the frame displacement in here,

943
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,000
We add it right?

944
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:29,600
Yeah.

945
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:36,300
Well, so yes, I don't know why that's problem.

946
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,100
But what I was going to say is I also had this, I wanted it on Landing

947
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,300
but I accidentally put it with the one before landing.

948
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,800
So that's an interesting case.

949
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:06,700
Hold on a second.

950
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,700
The other thing is there before these particles are initialized,

951
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,100
they're all stacked on top of each other.

952
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
So one thing I would want to do at least at the time, being is say, if

953
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:20,900
AC, I'm sorry, if C dot a is greater than 0, if it's not, don't push

954
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,200
it.

955
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,600
That way we won't be rendering like, uninitialized, particles.

956
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,200
So that should be doing nothing.

957
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,400
so I'm wondering why that's actually doing it taking any time, because

958
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,400
I feel like

959
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,300
those Alpha values should all be zero, right?

960
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,700
I want to see what happens there.

961
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,600
I don't understand why we're getting any effects to the product

962
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:53,900
system.

963
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,200
The first time around

964
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,900
alright, so here's our first time through

965
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:08,300
Help that's awesome.

966
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,800
Greater than or equal to 0?

967
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,500
Yeah.

968
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,200
Well guess what?

969
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,200
It's always going to be greater than or equal to 0 or at least most of

970
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,000
the time I wanted that.

971
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:17,600
Yeah.

972
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,700
So there we go.

973
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,700
So anyway, so yeah, so our problem here is just that that is

974
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:27,200
frame-to-frame.

975
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,900
Displacement is not being applied the way, I would think it should.

976
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,900
So the first thing I'm going to do is just make sure that it's

977
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,300
actually getting imply that properly at all, but I don't see how it

978
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,800
couldn't be but, you know, either way.

979
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,800
So I'm going to do here is just double check that it is getting.

980
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,600
Just, just it is getting done the way that I would have.

981
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,400
Thought it thought it would.

982
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,200
I want to say frame to frame 20.

983
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,200
This is going backwards, so there's that.

984
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,300
Yeah.

985
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,000
Because that's the motion that would take you from the location of the

986
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,500
last camera to the location of the new camera.

987
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:06,900
Right.

988
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,900
So here is where the old camera is.

989
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,500
And this is the new camera.

990
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,700
And so if I move the camera This way everything on the screen should

991
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,700
move that way but I'm moving the particles in that direction.

992
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,500
So I'm actually compounding the problem at that point, which is the

993
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,900
opposite of what I wanted to do.

994
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:40,500
So really, we want this to be the opposite, so I think that's still

995
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,000
the right name for that.

996
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:48,300
but we just want to pass the - so that they'll move counter to

997
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,300
Where that is?

998
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:53,600
So yeah.

999
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,800
So we'll start with that.

1000
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,800
But it still seems like they're staying in one place when I go there.

1001
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
So I'm going to have to look and see the missing.

1002
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
I got to say this is kind of funny having all these like particles

1003
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,200
I think it feels like the cameras, ah.

1004
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:15,900
I was going to say.

1005
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,700
It feels like the camera.

1006
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,600
Has an additional displacement and it does, right?

1007
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:32,200
And it actually does the camera and the Sim Center thing, there's the

1008
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,000
world mode camera offset, which is a separate thing on top of that,

1009
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:37,800
right?

1010
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,300
So we actually have last can repeat.

1011
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,200
We also have last camera offset, that's kind of annoying.

1012
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,100
What if we can make do without that, I know we had that for animation

1013
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,800
purposes.

1014
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,600
I don't fully remember why to be completely honest with you.

1015
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,600
But anyway, I think as we want to lock

1016
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,100
Like to room to room but so we actually need both of these.

1017
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,900
We need

1018
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:13,400
We need both of those and so we want to say like, okay subtract those

1019
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:21,700
two and then add to it, World mode camera offset - build mode, last

1020
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:22,800
camera, all set.

1021
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:26,800
So yeah.

1022
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,600
So, there we go.

1023
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,400
Now our particles are moving.

1024
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,100
I think a little more properly.

1025
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,200
Chris, I don't really know because it's a very quick transition.

1026
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:05,500
But let's make those guys died out a little sooner, just just for just

1027
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,300
for fun.

1028
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:23,300
So when we spawn one of these guys that we have the that Delta I'm

1029
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,200
going to just shorten that up a lot.

1030
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,000
So the parts one particles will just kind of kick up and just be

1031
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
really really sparse like that.

1032
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,600
All right.

1033
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,700
So now we'll see if these particles are.

1034
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,900
See, I feel like there's some weird thing happening there.

1035
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,500
Why are we seeing when we cross over here?

1036
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,700
There's kind of like these old particles that look like there should

1037
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,900
have been somebody there to spawn them.

1038
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
Like they weren't getting updated or something like

1039
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,800
But that is really make any sense.

1040
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,200
So still kind of feels like maybe there's a bug there.

1041
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:16,500
With the updating.

1042
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:29,700
yeah, so if the particles are being spawned

1043
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,000
The transfer of.

1044
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,400
Yes.

1045
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,100
So I feel like this, I feel like I know what's happening there too.

1046
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:41,500
So I feel like what's happening there is when we do the transform that

1047
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,200
camera all set is something that we're actually pushing on

1048
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,900
to the entity transform, right?

1049
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,900
That camera off set.

1050
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,600
Is getting pushed on here.

1051
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,800
So that means it's strictly, it's strictly a transform that's being

1052
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:13,100
applied to not to the like the entities themselves.

1053
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,000
Their locations are still relative to the Sim center, right?

1054
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,100
So

1055
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:26,400
we need to either use the same technique for that, which maybe is the

1056
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,800
best course of action.

1057
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,100
So always use the that world transform.

1058
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,000
Always just use that world transform for the particle systems and then

1059
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,900
we wouldn't need to track the camera offset anymore.

1060
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,900
That seems like, maybe a better idea.

1061
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,500
Because what's happening there, right?

1062
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:57,100
Is that when the screen is displaced by just camera offset, our

1063
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,100
particles are spawning in the wrong locations because those particles

1064
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:05,500
are being spawned in the entity space, which is not actually

1065
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,100
displaced, right?

1066
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,400
So you kind of have this situation where you really don't want, I

1067
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,200
really don't want that.

1068
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,100
I guess so the camera offset could stay.

1069
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,000
And then that way, we also wouldn't have to do this which is nice,

1070
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:19,600
right?

1071
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,800
So you can just say like no, that's not happening.

1072
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,500
So the camera offset stuff is the way it is.

1073
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:34,500
And then when we do the rendering of the particles, we just pass this

1074
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,100
world transform down as the transform to use.

1075
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,300
For everybody.

1076
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,500
And that way it will get this place automatically and then now

1077
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,200
everyone's in the same space I think I think that's a will then be a

1078
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,000
much more may be consistent way to do it.

1079
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,300
So if we get rid of this, we pass it down.

1080
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,000
Like so.

1081
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,300
And then we would just pass it through.

1082
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,700
And everyone's happy.

1083
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,100
Well, I don't actually know if everyone is happy but they might be

1084
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,600
happy.

1085
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,399
And probably that should be a pointer, huh?

1086
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,500
Okay.

1087
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,500
Almost done.

1088
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,600
Now, I think we're good.

1089
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,000
All right.

1090
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,500
All right, we'll do some Q&A.

1091
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,300
Martin's.

1092
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,200
Thanks for the reminder.

1093
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,400
He's pointing out that we can't access those.

1094
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,000
I think didn't we?

1095
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,100
Did we have a way of getting those.

1096
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,400
That was like a get thing.

1097
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,800
I thought we wrote one of those.

1098
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:39,900
This is it.

1099
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,700
Right.

1100
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,800
So that's how we were getting around that before.

1101
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,300
So yeah, this again is not code that will stay there.

1102
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,500
I don't think.

1103
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,500
So, we should be able to do ma.

1104
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,700
I m,

1105
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,500
Ki.

1106
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,500
And that will again prevent clang time complaining because for some

1107
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,200
reason it's defined two different ways on the two different platforms.

1108
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,000
No reason for this.

1109
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,800
do not know why, but it just is

1110
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:55,400
Okay.

1111
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,100
So in theory we should be able to love this up.

1112
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:08,200
I don't think we probably want these to be called M&M I and I think

1113
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:12,600
now is probably time but we want to start having our own Cindy.

1114
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:18,400
So I'll probably also just say hey maybe we'll do handmade

1115
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,300
Cindy.

1116
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,200
Dot h.

1117
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,800
Dot CPP.

1118
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,600
And that way.

1119
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,500
We can just go ahead and grab these guys and put them in there.

1120
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,900
I'm assuming that we don't actually want these to be MMI but anyway

1121
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:54,800
what we can also do is say all of this stuff can now because this is

1122
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,300
sort of 70 based things.

1123
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,500
We can put these guys in here.

1124
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,500
We can get all their operators in there and that way we can use those

1125
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,000
later for anything that we want to 70.

1126
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,300
That's not how you spell Cindy.

1127
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,600
Not how you spell it.

1128
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,100
All right, so this guy needs to include that because I believe that's

1129
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,800
not that needs to be included here.

1130
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,200
So maybe shared needs to have that.

1131
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,800
So maybe

1132
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,400
It's better to do it.

1133
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:04,900
And here, let's say.

1134
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,400
Oops.

1135
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:24,300
And maybe I'll just go like, okay, maybe I'll say handmade Cindy dot

1136
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,000
CPP is not a thing.

1137
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:46,300
There we go.

1138
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:48,600
So, there we go.

1139
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,000
So, I suppose, the kid was suggesting to slow down the time to make

1140
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,200
sure it is now, right?

1141
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,400
We can definitely do that.

1142
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,500
Although I should probably get over there first so I don't have to

1143
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:21,400
laborious Lee, hop over to slowly.

1144
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,300
All right.

1145
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,800
Looks pretty solid.

1146
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:45,100
I don't see like I can't do anything.

1147
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:45,900
I can't tell us.

1148
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,500
Are they possibly one frame?

1149
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:48,400
Lagged?

1150
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,700
You know I'm saying?

1151
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,200
I can't tell.

1152
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:09,900
Right?

1153
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:13,000
Because that could be, that could be a bug if they were one frame.

1154
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,500
Laggy.

1155
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,700
I will say, they do seem to change position a little bit in a way that

1156
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,100
I'm not sure if they should.

1157
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,600
The problem is, I don't know if there's e-value is such that they

1158
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,900
should, but they do look like they change.

1159
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,300
They do look like they

1160
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,500
shift a little around in there.

1161
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,600
In their grid squares.

1162
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,200
So, I'm not sure.

1163
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,900
Like there may be a bug there.

1164
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, I think they're definitely because they're definitely shifting.

1165
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,900
I think I think I'm going to call that a bug at least till we can

1166
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:30,200
prove.

1167
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:30,900
Otherwise,

1168
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,700
And they like waiver back and forth.

1169
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,300
The like it's really weird.

1170
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,500
So here's the really weird thing about it is while we're in the middle

1171
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:02,100
here, we should not be doing any modifications to the particle systems

1172
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:02,700
at all.

1173
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,100
Right?

1174
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:10,300
Because while we're, while we're scrolling to the left, it's just the

1175
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,100
camera offset.

1176
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,000
That's doing it.

1177
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,200
It's only right there at the crossover point that we actually apply

1178
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,800
anything.

1179
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,100
So it just feels like they're getting transformed on like a higher

1180
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,800
plane, you know.

1181
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,500
Like they're on like this plane like they're up above.

1182
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,200
Or something.

1183
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,200
I don't know.

1184
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,900
That's a bit weird.

1185
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,700
I'm going to I that's going to be an involved, debug, I think so.

1186
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:41,900
We're going to have to save that I think for tomorrow.

1187
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,400
Not too long ago, you change real courts PS3 to instead of u-32.

1188
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,000
I think they were unsigned originally.

1189
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,900
So that overflow would work correctly to have the world wrap around,

1190
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,400
but that will still work at the moment.

1191
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,500
Since we're centered around zero, I think having them be you three

1192
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,100
twos doesn't actually matter.

1193
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,600
Like I don't think we need that anymore.

1194
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,400
I could be wrong about that though.

1195
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,600
Super fun code.

1196
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,400
Hobo does the Z position of the particles.

1197
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,300
Not get affected by the protective transform?

1198
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,600
Well, the perspective transform is,

1199
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,400
oh well, you know what?

1200
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,500
I don't know that we are setting.

1201
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
We don't set any floor transform for it so it could be that they're on

1202
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,100
a different floor.

1203
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:51,900
Yeah, that's hard to say.

1204
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,800
Remember only the floor, the floor relative height.

1205
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
art of things is the only thing that I'm sorry, the the Which floor

1206
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,300
you're on they get set is the only thing that determines how you kind

1207
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:13,200
of slide relative to other things perspective, transform lives and so

1208
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,200
your height above the floor, doesn't do that but

1209
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,600
I don't remember.

1210
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,600
I don't remember.

1211
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,500
What?

1212
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,400
We set these two.

1213
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:53,500
So we set the floor Z here, right?

1214
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,300
And

1215
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,600
you know, for our particles

1216
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,900
I don't really know what we want to do there for those transforms.

1217
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,800
That's a good question.

1218
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,700
when your position goes from into in Max, when it cause undefined

1219
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,500
Behavior,

1220
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,400
Why would it cause undefined Behavior?

1221
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,300
I don't think so.

1222
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,300
But either way, like, you can't get out that far.

1223
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,100
You'd never make it.

1224
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,500
We'll see.

1225
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,000
Ya signed integer overflow.

1226
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We don't like if the compiler is not going to treat that properly then

1227
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:30,800
you know, oh well like I said you can't actually get out there so I

1228
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,700
don't really care what happens.

1229
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,900
There's no way for the player to make it that far out.

1230
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,600
I don't think

1231
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,100
And if for some reason, we were worried about the player eventually

1232
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,000
getting there, we just make our chunk size bigger because that's only

1233
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,100
used for the chunk size.

1234
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,800
With I sense.

1235
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,700
But I just don't I just don't remember if we what we actually use them

1236
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:01,100
for.

1237
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:01,400
Yeah.

1238
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,900
See, we're using us 32s for everything.

1239
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:06,800
We're not using you 32s.

1240
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,600
So, the like it's been that way forever.

1241
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,300
It's just, it was only the code.

1242
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:21,700
The only code I changed that you're talking about was like in the

1243
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,900
world in the little like world-building, like, you know, this last

1244
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:29,600
screen Z nonsense, which is just a little, you know, you're relevant

1245
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:29,800
code.

1246
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,800
Anyway, it's just, it's just test code to create rooms for us to play

1247
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,100
with.

1248
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:38,800
Mmm.

1249
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,400
I will say not having real 3D, is just a real pain in the butt.

1250
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,800
There are so many things that you just can't do.

1251
01:25:58,100 --> 01:25:59,700
When you don't have real 3D.

1252
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:09,500
Yeah.

1253
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:14,100
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and close things down here.

1254
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:14,700
It's late.

1255
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,600
All right, everyone, thank you for joining me for another set of

1256
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,000
handmade here.

1257
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,100
It's my pleasure coding with you.

1258
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,400
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

1259
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,200
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org.

1260
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,600
It comes to the source code so that you can follow along.

1261
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,000
We also have Forum site, you can go to.

1262
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,800
If you want to ask questions, you have patreon page and go to

1263
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,200
transport the video series, a schedule bot that week schedule.

1264
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,500
You in an episode guide for catching up on old stuff.

1265
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:50,800
I will be back here tomorrow night, same time, same place, until then

1266
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,800
have fun programming and I'll see you guys.

1267
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:53,500
Guys on the internet.

1268
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,400
Take it easy, everyone.
