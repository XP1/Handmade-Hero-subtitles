1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,600
We are on day 39 here.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,300
This is, of course, a full game and engine coated live on Twitch in C

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,600
and C++ using know libraries, no engines.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,500
We are basically doing absolutely everything from scratch, largely

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,800
sort of as, as both an educational process and, and just for fun.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,400
I think it's really good for, you know, on both on both ends really,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,800
for the kite.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Type of person who actually enjoys programming than being able to

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,400
program.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Everything yourself is kind of a fun thing to do.

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,200
Especially nowadays when you don't get to do that, all that often.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
And I've certainly been having fun doing it, and I think a lot of the

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,200
people out there have been to and also, it's a great thing for

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
educational purposes because a lot of people just don't have a chance,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,600
a lot of times depending on sort of what their programming language

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,200
was to go through and do all kinds of interesting, low-level stuff and

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,700
build an entire game engine from the ground up and that sort of thing.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,100
And so there's just a lot of cool stuff.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,900
You can learn in there.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:56,900
I think.

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,800
Anyway, I always feel like most all the most

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,200
I think stuff that I've ever learned in programming came from having

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,300
to tackle, you know, hard, low-level problems really honestly, even

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,400
the good high level programming stuff that I know is largely from

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,800
having to do sort of, you know, having to think about hard

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,000
constraints, and, that sort of stuff.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,000
So, anyway, right now we are at the point where we sort of gotten,

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,100
we're sort of wrapping up the stuff that we can reasonably do before

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,300
we learn some math.

32
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,800
Basically is what, what I guess, how I would say it, we've wrapped up.

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,000
Up sort of the basic stuff of putting Sprites on the screen, you know,

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,700
loading, B Babs.

35
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,600
Doing some basic Alpha blending techniques, building a tile map and

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,700
moving around through the tile map, that sort of stuff.

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,900
But in order to start moving forwards in, you know, on the, on the

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,000
engine further, what we kind of need to do is we're probably going to

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,700
need to start doing some math very soon.

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,600
So I think today, what we're probably going to do is we're going to go

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,300
through and we're just going to kind of like do a pass over the stuff

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,400
that we've got so far and just kind of like clean things up.

43
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,700
And

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
To get things into place where we relatively happy with them.

45
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,600
So that we can start clearing the way for doing, really, maybe

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,900
starting to have a serious discussion about gay math and what sort of

47
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,500
math, we need to know and what all the different types of math are

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,100
that tend to come up in games.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,000
And so, then starts go through some of the one, the most basic ones

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,300
that we will need in order to move forward with your basic 2D Vector

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,000
math and stuff like that, which we're going to need for just about

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,900
everything that we're going to do.

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,700
So if you went to him made here at Oregon, pre-ordered the game using

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,800
the little pre-order button,

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,900
And you should have gotten an email with a link that allows you to

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,800
download the source code and the test assets that we use as well.

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,100
There's two zips up there.

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,300
Make sure you grab both of those.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
And inside the source code ZIP.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
There's a bunch of different Zips resource codes from every different

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,200
day.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,700
We're on day 39 right now.

63
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,200
So if you want to follow along at home, unzip day, 38 source, code

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,500
day, 38 source code is what we are starting with now, and if you unzip

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,700
that, you will be at the exact location that I am starting with today.

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,600
So you can follow along exactly the way that we are with exactly what

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,800
we're doing.

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
So, if you guys remember, we gotten to the point at the end of last

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,900
streamer, we were able to blit basically things on top of other

70
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,900
things, which allows us essentially to compose whatever we want in

71
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,600
terms of Graphics.

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,900
Now, we can, you know, layer Sprites on top of each other all day

73
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,500
long, but we had only just finished that so we didn't just we didn't

74
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,800
really do anything with it.

75
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,300
So I was thinking, maybe today, what we could do is just load in our,

76
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,700
our little hero Sprite and he's in three pieces.

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,300
As I think I showed when I was going through the different Sprites

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,900
that were in there.

79
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
He's in three different pieces.

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
So maybe we'll go in and load his three.

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,200
Pieces.

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,000
And we also have four facing directions for him.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,300
So maybe we'll load in all of those and we'll sort of make a thing

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,900
where he can.

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,500
As we move, he faces the direction, you know, that we're moving or

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,100
something like that.

87
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Just something basic to sort of clean up the bitmap loading, and the

88
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,800
bitmap display code into something that were relatively comfortable

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,600
with for the moment before we kind of move on to trying to do a little

90
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,000
bit, more serious stuff again and where we'd have to start talking

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,100
about math for reals for reals with a z.

92
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,700
So, okay, assuming that we're in that situation right now, we

93
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,600
We are loading all of our bitmaps.

94
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,600
We haven't talked really very much about Asset Management in terms of

95
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,300
how we're managing loading stuff in the code.

96
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,600
And that's actually deliberate.

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,400
It's not something that I think is really worth discussing at the

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,700
moment.

99
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,200
I think that's going to be something that comes into play.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Once we have a bit of the renderer sort of the real renderer.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Once we kind of have more of a real renderer, written is really the

102
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,500
more the appropriate time to start thinking about that.

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,100
So right now we just have the sort of the most basic thing you might

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,700
do in a game which is loading all the assets at startup not up.

105
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,300
Really useful thing to do if you're actually talking about a shipping

106
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,600
game.

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,500
Because like I said, in this game, we're going to be streaming our

108
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,600
Assets in so loading, everything at startup isn't really an option for

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:39,800
us.

110
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
But while we're just developing things that certainly fine.

111
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,500
So I'm going to have to load these different hero, things for four,

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,300
different directions.

113
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
So I'm just going to go ahead and make life a little easier on myself

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,300
for now and just say that we have sort of a hero bitmaps structure and

115
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,700
that will have basically the different pieces, the head of the cape

116
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,900
and the Torso each for, you know, the different facing directions of

117
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,400
the hero so that I can base their we have hero bitmaps.

118
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,300
And the here, a bit maps that we have.

119
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,500
Our for the for facing Direction.

120
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,500
So, we'll just stay here a bit maps and I guess I'll do.

121
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,300
I don't know.

122
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,600
We could do something like just a brackets for I guess.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
Because we will essentially have to map into that somehow.

124
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,300
We'll think about that in a second.

125
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,500
But, anyway, if I want to load those in, I've already got code that

126
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,000
loads each of the each of the test pieces in here into the hero head.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,200
I don't know what happened to our hero torso code.

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,700
I must have actually hit Ctrl K.

129
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,500
That's a mistake.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,100
So

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
so we already have code that does that, which is this code right here,

132
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,600
but I need to load one of those for each of the facing directions.

133
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,500
Like test here are front, you know, the sort of the front back side

134
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,400
and all that sort of stuff.

135
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
So I'm going to go ahead and do this.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,700
Responsible thing here just do hero bitmaps, and I'm going to

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,700
substitute in basically one of these like that for each of these ones

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
that we load like so.

139
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,400
And then I'm just going to go ahead and call that four times.

140
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Nothing particularly exciting here.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
And like I said, we'll think a little think harder about how we want

142
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,400
to do this stuff.

143
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,200
Once we actually think about asset loading and how we want to identify

144
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,600
bit Mass because in general, you know, you don't want to have to have

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,300
huge tables of strings in your code.

146
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,700
At least.

147
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,300
I don't.

148
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,800
And so,

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,700
So that's not something that I would encourage you to do when you're

150
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,900
actually doing the real code, but for now, it's exactly the right

151
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,700
thing to do because you do not want to be thinking about that while

152
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,400
you're trying to work on other pieces of the code.

153
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,300
So here is the set of files that we have.

154
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,100
We have front back left and right.

155
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,500
I'm not sure what the best way to map.

156
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,100
Those two zero one, two, and three are at the moment.

157
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,200
So I guess, maybe what I will say is let's go ahead and just do we'll

158
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,900
just do maybe

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,800
With with moving right in that 0 slot.

160
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,100
And then, you know, I'll go I'll basically do it almost like it was a

161
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,500
circle.

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,500
So then there's the, there's up is after that.

163
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,100
Like so and then this would be left.

164
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,200
Right?

165
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,900
And I guess it's not snot up.

166
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,800
It's actually that's that's looking at his back, right?

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,100
Like so and then and then front is down here, which we've already got.

168
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,000
And so that'll load all those bitmaps into memory for us and it'll

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,900
just go ahead and be using those for the entire run of the game.

170
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,800
At the moment.

171
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,100
If I go ahead and compile then we will not be able to find that when

172
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,700
we do the hero head but we should be able to do here a bitmap 0 dot

173
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,100
head.

174
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,200
And now we should basically be back to exactly where we were before.

175
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,200
Only now, he's, you know, the other facing direction, right, but I'm

176
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,300
going to need, actually to draw.

177
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, you know what?

178
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,700
I don't know why I keep forgetting the fact that I can always leave

179
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,500
the code running.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We don't actually have to don't have to, I guess it's just from a lot

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,100
of the stuff that I work on data.

182
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Today doesn't have this feature necessarily, so you kind of get in the

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,600
habit.

184
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,200
Unfortunately, oops, that's not right.

185
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,100
So if I have the head, I have the Torso and I have the cape.

186
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,000
I guess the cape comes over the Torso.

187
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,500
Basically, what I do is I want to draw these in reverse order because

188
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
remember, this is a lot like Photoshop things get layered on top of

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,600
each other.

190
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,800
So what I actually want is I want the Torso first since that's the

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,000
thing.

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,900
That's the lowest down in terms of what gets shown then the cape gets

193
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,100
laid on top of that, then the head on top of that and in theory, that

194
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
should reconstruct my hero.

195
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,799
If, if I'm not very much mistaken, and yes, there is, there's a little

196
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,700
hero fellow and he is facing in the, in the direction to the right,

197
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,900
which is what I expected.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Now.

199
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,400
I probably could also say here, you know, if I had a facing direction

200
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,700
for the little fellow right?

201
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,800
If I had facing Direction equals 0, let's say and I went in here and

202
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
said, you know, facing Direction like this.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,300
I think then I would be able to also sort of flip them around.

204
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,500
I suppose as I go right, if I flip it to one, there.

205
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
He goes to nice facing that way.

206
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,400
Three nice facing towards us.

207
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
And so if I wanted him to basically face the direction that he's

208
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
actually moving in over 3000.

209
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Okay, don't think 3000 is very good.

210
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,300
Things happen.

211
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:22,500
There.

212
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,300
If I wanted to face the wreck, she's moving.

213
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,800
I just need some way of specifying, what it was, whatever that last

214
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,500
erection was.

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,100
That is the direction in which he moved, right?

216
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,900
So, if I go in here, and I just say, all right, that facing Direction,

217
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,100
you know, hero facing direction is now a parameter.

218
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,800
And then out here.

219
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,100
I can go ahead and grab out the hero bitmaps thing that that is

220
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,500
appropriate based on that facing direction, right?

221
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,400
I can go ahead and do you know, gamestate hero bitmaps?

222
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,200
For game state hero, facing direction that would give me back that

223
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,800
bitmap that I actually want the whichever one, you know, it's actually

224
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,400
supposed to be.

225
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
And so then if I go in here and just go ahead and change these all to

226
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,300
sort of operate off of that, then I sort of made it so that we can

227
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,500
easily store in the game State structure.

228
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,400
What it actually is we want the hero facing direction to be.

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,800
So if I go ahead and go over to the code.

230
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,200
Where we actually move the guy around right with move up, move down,

231
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,500
move left and move, right?

232
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,700
It'd be pretty trivial for me, to sort of go and just set it to

233
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,800
whichever key down.

234
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,100
You pressed last, which is a totally reasonable thing to do for now,

235
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
since we don't really, again, we haven't done that Vector math, so we

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,400
can't really do much.

237
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,300
We haven't really written any real hero movement code yet.

238
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,500
And so, it's, you know, it's not really going to be something that we

239
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,000
can do anything fancy with yet, but for now, we can certainly set the

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,700
hero facing direction to whichever thing you

241
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,800
Actually push down last.

242
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,100
So if the hero, you know was was was moving upward, we can set it to

243
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
that moving up direction.

244
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
If the here was moving down here.

245
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,800
We can say to that moving down, you know, the left and and the right

246
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,300
like so and then if I go ahead and compile that what's these are

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,400
supposed to be address of the bitmap there?

248
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,400
Now, I should have a way to basically have my my dude change

249
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,000
direction.

250
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,800
Oops, and I've got I missed.

251
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,500
I missed typed at once there.

252
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,700
So I

253
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
I've inverted, my my two directions.

254
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,000
What did I do?

255
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,400
Let's see here.

256
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
So if we're moving left, yes, left is supposed to be to write is

257
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,600
supposed to be 0.

258
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
That's that's what I said when I made it, but I didn't actually do it.

259
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,100
And so now the hero actually does change for whatever Direction, he

260
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,900
moves in and I'd like to go ahead and Center him on his rectangle as

261
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,300
well.

262
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,700
You'll notice that basically the bitmap right now.

263
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,500
We do have something.

264
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,400
In fact, this is probably something worth talking about because we

265
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,500
haven't really addressed it.

266
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
And in the art assets yet.

267
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,600
We're not actually at the level of loading artists.

268
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
That's where this sort of stuff comes in.

269
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,100
But we'll need to do something as sort of a temporary temporary fix to

270
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,400
it.

271
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,100
If you consider the fact, if you consider what these bitmaps actually

272
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,200
are, right?

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,700
If we actually go and you can see, we're drawing the players bitmaps,

274
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,000
right?

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All those three bitmaps.

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're drawing them with this upper left corner here.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,900
This this is the point, the position that we are passing.

278
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,500
When we say, we want to draw those bitmaps.

279
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,100
There's a bunch of information, kind of, there's a bunch of sort of

280
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
assumed information.

281
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,500
That's all getting baked in there.

282
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,100
And it's why, for example, the hero is kind of nowhere near where our

283
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,200
rectangle thinks you should be.

284
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,300
This was our little test triangle rectangle that said, where we

285
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,000
thought the hero should be and that, so it's not at all.

286
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Correct, right.

287
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,500
We'd expect the hero to kind of be standing up, you know, with this

288
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,100
feet roughly where the bottom of the rectangle, where was for example,

289
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
but that's not at all what's happening.

290
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,000
And so considering that situation, right?

291
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:55,900
What's

292
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,700
On their.

293
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,500
Well, if you look at what we've got in terms of assets.

294
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,400
If you go into the test directory and look at what these assets are,

295
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
let's say we open one of them up.

296
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, obviously, I'll open up all three for a given facing direction

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
will open up the front facing ones for now inside gimp.

298
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,300
And what you can actually see if you take a look at these guys.

299
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
In fact, you know, what I can do to?

300
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
That was probably the wrong way to do.

301
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,400
It course that opens three different copies of gimp.

302
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,700
Therefore.

303
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,900
We thank you so much gimp.

304
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:26,700
What?

305
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,100
I'll actually do is I'll go ahead and we have the front torso loaded.

306
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,300
I'm going to load the head and the

307
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Ape and so now they're all in there as a layer right there.

308
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,200
All on is there as layers and what you can see is basically the way

309
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,800
the art comes in because these are raw RSS.

310
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,300
There were loading.

311
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,100
We haven't processed ever done anything to them.

312
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,000
Basically.

313
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,500
They're just a giant empty space around the guy which is totally fine.

314
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Like we want that.

315
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,500
That's what you want your artist to give you but then you need to do

316
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,000
work to kind of process those down into final art assets that you

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
would use and you would store all that empty space obviously.

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,900
And so on so forth, but the other important part of this is that

319
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,300
there's essentially an implicit

320
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
it hotspot defined here.

321
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
Often times what it's called.

322
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,300
It's often times called a hot spot on.

323
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,200
That's like the old school term for it.

324
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,100
It's sort of what the used to call like cursor locations and stuff

325
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,200
that you'd use for offsets.

326
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,300
It's, I don't actually know why the term is what it is, but there's an

327
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,000
implicit sort of alignment point you could think of which is basically

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,400
right down here, where the dude is standing is where we kind of want

329
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,300
to position him in the world, right?

330
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,300
We want to have this point.

331
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,800
Line with where we think the players position is like something like

332
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,400
that, right basically, right where he would be sort of standing where

333
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,900
he would be touching the ground.

334
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Right?

335
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,900
And we don't actually have that information yet.

336
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
And so what we're going to have to do in our eventual, real art files

337
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,500
is, we will have to have those registration marks basically in there,

338
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,400
or we'll have to set the manually.

339
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,600
One of the other doesn't matter, but you have to do something along

340
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,300
those lines.

341
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,600
And so, if I look in there, I can actually see down in the bottom

342
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,800
here.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,700
Right here, gimp will tell me what those pixel coordinates are like 72

344
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,000
180, 270, 2, comma 1 82, right?

345
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,400
You kind of see as I move.

346
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,900
Those are the X and Y positions, so we can go ahead and put that in

347
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,000
there.

348
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,600
We can say that at 72, roughly 72 182 for that particular facing

349
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,700
direction, right?

350
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,800
And that's that's the one where he's facing the front.

351
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,200
So in the one where he's facing the front, and in fact, I guess we

352
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,800
could sort of do it.

353
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
Here, so, it's oops.

354
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
It's a 72.

355
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,300
And 182 for the X and the Y, we could go ahead and make this a little

356
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,200
more concise here.

357
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
And basically say, well, okay, there's these hero bitmaps and we're

358
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:47,900
going to introduce another thing which is basically the aligned X and

359
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,000
a line, Y, right for this bitmap set.

360
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,300
So that we kind of know how to position them relative to the points

361
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,900
that we actually care about in the world.

362
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,600
That makes sense.

363
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,200
Okay.

364
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,900
So, what we want to do is we want to basically have those

365
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,100
registrations that will just hard code for now into this part

366
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,700
ourselves.

367
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,500
And then when we get to the point where we actually are talking about

368
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,000
putting large numbers of assets into the game, what we'll need to do

369
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,800
is we'll need to have a way of actually loading that data from

370
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,300
somewhere like that data will have to be produced in a more efficient

371
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:29,600
fashion.

372
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,300
We probably don't want to sit here and hand coded ourselves.

373
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,400
What we'd rather have is some way of just marking it in Photoshop or

374
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,800
whatever it is.

375
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,000
And then

376
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Those are access get exporter will make sure they get exported to

377
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,300
something that we can read when we process our art assets.

378
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,500
So I'm going to go ahead here and just do something like this where we

379
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,800
can sort of have a nice.

380
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Yeah, something like that.

381
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
In fact, I guess what I could do.

382
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,200
Yeah.

383
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
This is actually pretty easy.

384
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
You could actually do this and then I'll just do.

385
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,099
Bitmap Arrowhead equals, debug load like so and and

386
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,900
It map hero Cape so just clean things up a little bit here.

387
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,099
So there's not quite so verbose.

388
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,300
There we go.

389
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,400
And now I'll also do bitmap a line x equals something and bitmap a

390
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,700
line, Y equals something, and then I'll move on to the next bit map.

391
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,599
Right?

392
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,900
So this will just load our hero bitmaps as they were.

393
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,300
So I'm just going to go ahead and make that change everywhere.

394
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,600
I think I can probably, I don't know, you know, it's always dicey when

395
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,000
I do this.

396
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,700
But we're going to do it.

397
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,800
Anyway, I think, I think it's just, it's the right time to do it

398
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,500
people and you know, when it's the right time to do it, you know, and

399
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
when it's the right time, you kind of just got to go with it.

400
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,700
You kind of gotta go with the flow sometimes.

401
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
So there we go with that and then we'll put that here.

402
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
So let's go ahead and get that going on.

403
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,100
There we go.

404
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,200
It's clean that up.

405
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,000
And now we've got something a little more respectable in terms of

406
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,000
code.

407
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,500
We can use.

408
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,700
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and just manually for now, do those

409
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,400
offsets.

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
But again, that's just something, you know, something definitely to

411
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,300
pay attention to, you know, if you didn't have me, sitting here,

412
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
telling you the sorts of things that will probably do.

413
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
Because I've done all this stuff like this before.

414
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,000
This would basically a place where you'd want to think in your head,

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,800
you know, I don't want to be sitting here manually.

416
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
I open up these bitmaps every time.

417
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
The artist change is something looking to see where that alignment

418
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,400
point is like, you can see that that's going to be something that's

419
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,300
going to take time.

420
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,200
And you might art, you know, you kind of want to think to yourself,

421
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,400
what could, what might we be able to do?

422
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,400
That could sort of speed that process up, right?

423
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Like, how could we how could we make a better way of setting these

424
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
alignment points?

425
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,800
Right?

426
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,100
And there's a lot of different ways you could do it, but it's just

427
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,100
something to be aware of it.

428
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,400
Kind of like it raises that little red flag where you kind of got to

429
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,900
think to yourself.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
Of what you know, what's the what's the end scheme here?

431
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,600
So it looks like actually, like, these are roughly the same.

432
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,800
I don't know.

433
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,800
Yong, Chi.

434
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,300
And may have already just kind of lined everything up for us, which is

435
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,100
kind of nice.

436
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,100
So, it looks like, they may all be roughly the same, so we won't have

437
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,000
to really do.

438
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, I think she might have, although that one's a little different

439
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,500
than than the other ones probably, but we could probably use them all

440
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,800
at the

441
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,800
Moment as as being 72 182.

442
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
That's what that's what actually they almost all look like is roughly

443
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,200
about value.

444
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,300
So we'll leave it like that, but we can tweak them later.

445
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,400
Okay.

446
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,100
So now we've got these loaded.

447
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,500
There we go.

448
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,200
What, why are you?

449
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,700
Oh, whoops.

450
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,500
That's no good.

451
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,100
I didn't even realize I still had the game.

452
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,300
Loading, my bad.

453
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,000
Sorry guys.

454
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,100
Okay, so now we've got our little fellow there.

455
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
And what I want to do is like I said, I've

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,900
The information in there.

457
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,800
Now, where I could go ahead and correct for where he should be

458
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,900
relative to that relative to the alignment point.

459
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,500
And so what I need to do is I need to have some way of actually taking

460
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
that alignment into account.

461
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,500
So, in here where I do this drawbitmap, I want to basically be able to

462
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,300
change the player left in the player top based on that alignment

463
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,000
amount.

464
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,600
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce probably a new

465
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
function here, which is a drawbitmap aligned function.

466
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,600
Or there is a different thing I could do which is I can make these

467
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,700
basically be some kind of registered coordinates.

468
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a little bit hard to say at the moment.

469
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,600
I think possibly in the interest of

470
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
It's so tough to say sometimes, you know.

471
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm not sure how we want to do this yet.

472
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,900
So I think temporarily what I might do is

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,200
I might just pass these as optional parameters into this thing.

474
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,300
We're going to want to do something fancier than this later, but I

475
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,300
think we might just want to have it in there, right there for now and

476
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,400
we'll sort of when we have more of a renderer.

477
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,100
There's going to be more clearer places where those should go in my

478
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,400
opinion.

479
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
So I think for now we'll just leave it like that.

480
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,300
And we can go ahead and say that the the hero bitmaps align X and the

481
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,200
hero bitmaps.

482
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,900
Align, why can go ahead and get passed in.

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,900
They're all right.

484
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,000
So I'll go ahead and compile that and what I want to do now, right is

485
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,700
I want to actually use those alignment points to offset the place

486
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,000
where we would be drawing the guy.

487
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,600
And I think I actually have to try to remember what we actually did

488
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,100
for player.

489
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,200
We're passing player left, and Claire top, but that's not what we

490
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
actually want anymore.

491
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,100
We actually just want the players actual location, right?

492
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
So so we actually want to

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Where the player actually is we want a player ground Point basically

494
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,500
and and we want that ground point in X and Y and we so so we don't

495
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,700
really, we're not so interested necessarily in these sort of like

496
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,500
adjustments for the players height in the players width and so on.

497
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,900
Right, that's not actually what we want to see what we want to see

498
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,400
here.

499
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,900
Is we want to see?

500
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,100
Let's see something more like that.

501
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
So that's going to be the player ground point x in the player.

502
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,900
Ground point Y and then

503
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,900
I'll go ahead and keep Computing the location for our rectangle as

504
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,100
well.

505
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,000
You might as well leave that drawing, but then in here, so what I want

506
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,700
to do is I want to pass those points that were aligning to, right.

507
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,700
So I'm going to pass those instead of the the left and top.

508
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So player, ground Point, why there we go.

509
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
So now, we're passing the right things in and now that should make our

510
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,800
guy up here, even more off center.

511
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
Because we're now passing this point right here, which means it's

512
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
drawing like this.

513
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,100
So now we have to do is do that alignment to get him back up to the

514
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,800
right place.

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,300
So, if I go into that drawbitmap call, you can sort of see.

516
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,300
It's not going to be particularly difficult.

517
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,500
We've got our real X and are real.

518
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,600
Why that come in here.

519
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,300
Basically, all we have to do is subtract from those the values that we

520
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,100
have for our alignment, right?

521
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,100
All we need to do is say we want this a line X, and this aligned, why

522
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,500
to actually be sort of the, the alignment Point versus the point that

523
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
we've been passed in.

524
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,300
So, if you think about what happens, I'll go ahead and draw it out for

525
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,600
you here.

526
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,500
On our handy.

527
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,400
Dandy whiteboard.

528
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,200
I don't know why create a still is

529
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,400
Passing a hand for our cursor.

530
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,900
Nobody really knows.

531
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,700
We don't try to understand create, do we just accept the fact that it

532
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,500
does what it does?

533
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,100
And so what I'm doing here right is, we've got a blind routine and the

534
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,800
blind routine is going to draw a rectangle from like, an upper corner.

535
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,100
It's going to copy these rows in here, right?

536
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,300
But what we have is we have a registration Mark right in the world.

537
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,800
That's basically where the player.

538
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,600
Point is.

539
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,500
So this is the ground point, right?

540
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,600
And then we have a bitmap that also has a registration Mark in it,

541
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,300
right?

542
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,100
That's measured from that upper corner.

543
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,500
So what we want to do, if we are saying that these two registration

544
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,000
marks should line up, then we're relative to the ground point.

545
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,500
Where would we draw?

546
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,800
Write that this bitmap?

547
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,200
Well, the answer is we just invert right?

548
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,500
Whatever.

549
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,300
This was if for saying that the aligned X and the line y is how you

550
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,600
get from the upper corner?

551
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
To the alignment point, then getting back to the upper corner is just

552
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,700
going to be a matter of subtracting them.

553
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,300
Right?

554
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,900
And so that's all I'm going to actually do here is, I'm just going to

555
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,200
go ahead and subtract those aligned X and the line Y points, so that I

556
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,300
can offset my bitmap by the amount that we possible, that would be

557
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,300
necessary to move those alignment points into into coinciding, right?

558
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
And so, now, you can see our little hero fellow.

559
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,100
He actually is properly aligned with where we thought he should be,

560
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
and that's all good.

561
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,800
He's a little

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
Often though in the direction that I said, maybe he would be often,

563
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,700
which is the side ones.

564
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,600
I wasn't sure what we should set those alignments to, but he's for the

565
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,900
most part, pretty much fine.

566
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,900
And so that's a lot better than what we had in there before.

567
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,200
Now.

568
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,800
What I'd like to do is I'd like to get back to screen-based stuff

569
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,900
here, you know, we had our tile map and then we started doing

570
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,200
scrolling just as a test thing.

571
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,900
I'd like to get back to having things fixed on the screen where we

572
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,000
just walk in the end.

573
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,700
We walk around the screen instead of the screen scrolling around us.

574
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,800
So I'd like to go back and and and

575
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,500
And change things back to going that way for a while.

576
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Until just because I that's sort of the way the game will mostly be

577
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,000
played.

578
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,500
And we don't kind of want this random stuff in here for now because

579
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,200
we're going to start working with the players actual move.

580
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,700
It code.

581
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,700
All right, so

582
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
Hopefully that was all very straightforward.

583
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:46,800
Nothing.

584
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,600
Particularly unusual going on there.

585
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,600
Let's see.

586
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,100
We got about 30 minutes left, which is quite some time.

587
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,500
Okay.

588
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,500
So what I want to do now is kind of figure out some way to keep our

589
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,000
camera centered so that we can have our tile Maps back.

590
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,600
Also.

591
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,300
I feel like we can probably at this point stop drawing the crazy

592
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
backdrop for now.

593
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,300
Well, I mean we could keep drawing that backed up.

594
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,800
I guess we could do a number of things.

595
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,500
I'd have to think about exactly what we should be doing.

596
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,500
It's a little bit difficult to say because again, trying to manage

597
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,600
stuff at this stage in the game.

598
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
We're kind of thinking about all the different places we could go.

599
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,900
There's so much.

600
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
There are so many different places that we can go obviously,

601
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,000
exploring.

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,400
Because we have every, every part of the system is still pretty much

603
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,000
up in the air.

604
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,600
But basically, I guess what I would say is, do we want to leave that

605
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,900
drawing the backdrop in there, you know, maybe we do at the very

606
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,200
least.

607
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,100
What I'd like to do is just leave the sort of the world fixed for now.

608
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Yeah, so what I'd like to do is I'd like to change it so that instead

609
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,100
of drawing out from around the player, because you remember this,

610
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,800
right here, drew our tile maps are this.

611
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Little debug thing for drawing.

612
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,100
What was filled in the tile map?

613
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,300
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to change it so that we have

614
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,000
both a player P and a camera P, right.

615
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,500
So now, I have a place where the camera is looking, and I have a place

616
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,400
for the players looking and they're not going to be the same anymore.

617
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,700
So now the camera p is basically going to be

618
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,800
You know, the place around which we Center that Tha map rendering.

619
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,900
So all the same stuff we were doing here.

620
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,700
We're going to do it's just we're not going to do them from the player

621
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,500
P, right?

622
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Instead of player pee in here.

623
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,100
We're going to do it from this perspective of the camera.

624
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
And so what we were doing.

625
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,400
Remember if you remember how we drew this town map, we are essentially

626
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,100
starting with whatever tile, the player was on.

627
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,900
We were saying that was going to be centered in the very middle of the

628
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,300
Green.

629
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,800
And then we were just going to walk out words from there to the 10

630
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,500
pick tiles on either side and I'm sorry 10 pixels up and down 10 tiles

631
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,300
up and down.

632
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,400
So 20 tiles total and 40 tiles across so negative negative, 20 to 20,

633
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,200
which is more than actually was on the screen.

634
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,900
We were kind of over drawing a little bit.

635
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,000
We were we were going a little bit further out.

636
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
So, what I want to do is just say, okay, we're going to do exactly the

637
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,000
same thing only instead of walking out from the players position.

638
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
We're going to walk out from the cameras position.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
So everywhere that there was a player pee in here, right?

640
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,200
I'm going to change it to a camera P, right?

641
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,000
And so that's that's how that's going to work.

642
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,800
So now when we initialize that player position at the outset of the

643
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,000
game, we're going to initialize the camera position to be something

644
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
logical as well.

645
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,100
So we initialize the player position somewhere in here.

646
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,700
There it is.

647
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,700
So,

648
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,600
We're going to say that.

649
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,100
There's also a stage where we initialize the camera position and that

650
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,700
camera position should just be let's say on that very first map that

651
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,300
very first tile map down in the corner at that tile chunk.

652
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,500
I think we said basically our tile system was going to be roughly

653
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,200
something like 17 by 9 or something like that.

654
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,100
I think is what we were saying, so I'll do 17 divided by 2 and 9

655
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,600
divided by 24 what that was going to be gamestate camera p.

656
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:22,500
AB style y equals 9 divided by 2 and you know what?

657
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,500
It's interesting.

658
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Well, I guess that's fine.

659
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,400
So, there we go, and we will go ahead and run that noun see where we

660
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,900
get.

661
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,300
So essentially.

662
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,600
Oh, right.

663
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,900
And now we actually have to do the work for doing player position as

664
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,000
well.

665
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,600
But now, our cameras going to be fixed.

666
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,500
And remember, we were cheating before we never actually computed where

667
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,100
to draw the player.

668
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,600
We just drew them at the middle of the screen.

669
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,700
So now we actually have to compute where he is.

670
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,900
Which means we're going to have to do a relative computation to see,

671
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,200
where is the player?

672
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,200
Relative to the camera because we know the camera is at the screen

673
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,400
center X and screen center.

674
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:55,600
Why?

675
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,600
We know that's where the camera is essentially going to be in sort of

676
00:29:59,600 --> 00:29:59,800
the space.

677
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,100
Let me draw the screen because that's the definition of the center of

678
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,700
the screen is wherever the camera is telling us to look.

679
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,400
So, what we need to do is we need to add something to that.

680
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,900
Right?

681
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,200
We need to say, where is the player relative to the camera so that we

682
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,700
know where to draw them relative to the center of the screen, right?

683
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,200
And so, what we need to do is we need to have essentially a

684
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,000
subtraction operator and this kind of leads nicely into that mass Seth

685
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was talking about, so this is going to be good because you will sort

686
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,900
of it.

687
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,600
Sort of is a nice segue, if you will.

688
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,400
For talking about this tomorrow or Monday, whenever we decide to

689
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,800
transition over it to it, but we've got these tile map positions and

690
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
basically what we want to be able to do is we want to be able to

691
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,300
subtract, right?

692
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,000
We want to be able to say, what is, how do I get from one to another?

693
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,700
If I have the player and I have the camera, how would I get from the

694
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,400
camera to the player?

695
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,500
Because that's the distance that I want to give in, in sort of.

696
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,300
That's, that's what I want to add to the screen center to know where

697
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,900
the player is, right.

698
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,700
So so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say, okay.

699
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,700
Let's actually pretend we have that.

700
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,700
Let's actually just say that we had something that could do a

701
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,200
subtraction right.

702
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,400
And it could subtract a tile map position from another time a position

703
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,600
and will give us back the real 32 answer, right?

704
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
So I'm just drawing a name for that at the moment.

705
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,500
I'm not suggesting.

706
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,400
This is actually going to be the name eventually but that, you know,

707
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,000
let's do that.

708
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,500
Subtraction.

709
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Right?

710
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,400
Well, that subtraction is just going to be between the game, the, the,

711
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
the player P, right.

712
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
And the camera pee.

713
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,600
Oops, State camera P like.

714
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,700
So now, of course, we might, as well just do.

715
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,400
We don't really want to have multiple functions for this.

716
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600
We might as well just do one.

717
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,400
That will actually give us back the whole answer.

718
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
And again, this is kind of setting up the mass.

719
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,200
So we're going to have to kind of do this in a bit of a janky way for

720
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,900
now, because we haven't introduced vectors yet.

721
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
So we're just going to kind of see it.

722
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
And then when we do our vectors, which I guess will be maybe tomorrow,

723
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,900
seems since it seems like, this is kind of the most pressing concern.

724
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,900
We can kind of see how it, how to clean this stuff up nicely.

725
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,700
So I could

726
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,400
Say there's a tile map difference function.

727
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Let's say, and that's going to basically give us back the difference

728
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,100
in X Y and Z when we do that subtraction.

729
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,200
So if I do the subtraction I could do it like this.

730
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I could say that we get back at I'll map difference.

731
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,900
Right?

732
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,900
And that, that difference is going to be the difference between the

733
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,300
player and the camera.

734
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,600
Once I have that difference.

735
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,700
It's pretty easy for me to go ahead and and add it in.

736
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,700
So I basically

737
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,700
basically now would have a way of getting to where I think the player

738
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,400
actually is.

739
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,300
So all I need to do is make something that could subtract these two

740
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,300
and produce one of those as a result.

741
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,200
So if I look at what has to happen to do that, right?

742
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Well, part of it is really, really simple.

743
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,400
Right?

744
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,000
If I've got two of these.

745
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,100
Let me go ahead and set this up for a little more success here.

746
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,800
If I had

747
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,300
Tile go like so.

748
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,300
So we've got Tom app difference that we want to return, right?

749
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,600
And we want to basically compute a d x, d y and add easy out of that.

750
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:22,800
Now, what I'd like to do is I'd like to take into tile map positions

751
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,900
in a and Abby.

752
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,400
Like so.

753
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,300
And then I would like to say,

754
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,400
How do I subtract a 2 of these?

755
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Well, I know how to subtract the offsets directly because the offsets

756
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,700
just are real 32.

757
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,600
So producing another floating-point offset by taking the distance.

758
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
The difference of these two is really, really easy.

759
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,900
It would look like this, right?

760
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
That's all I would have to do.

761
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,700
I would literally just subtract these offsets.

762
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,900
But what I need to do now is I need to account for these abs tiles,

763
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,600
right?

764
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,300
I don't have a way of accounting for the ABS Tiles at all.

765
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,100
Okay, so in order to do that.

766
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,000
I would, I want to be able to do a signed distance of some kind here.

767
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,199
So what I might do is say, alright, we could do the subtraction in

768
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,100
float for now.

769
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,900
I have to think about how I actually want to do this eventually, but

770
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,100
for now we could basically say all right, we've got the, the signed

771
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,000
distance which is the D Tile distance, right?

772
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,900
And that's going to be, you know, the ABS tile X.

773
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,400
From a - the ABS tile.

774
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,100
Why?

775
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,300
Like, so on, so we go, so I'm going to do that subtraction to get

776
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,000
these, these Delta's here detail x, d, Tau y, details Z, right and

777
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,600
then those are in tile.

778
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,800
So in order to change the distance in tiles, I would need to know that

779
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,000
tile side and M.

780
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,199
Right?

781
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,000
I need to know that tile map information.

782
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
So I'm going to have to take the tile map in order to do that

783
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,500
conversion.

784
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,500
Right.

785
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,200
I need to know for every one change.

786
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,800
When I do this.

787
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,100
How far are they in tiles?

788
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,900
I need to know how far that's actually going to be in the real M units

789
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,400
that we're using for everything else.

790
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,000
So the tile side and M, right?

791
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,100
That I'm going to have to go ahead and multiply in here, in order to,

792
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
in order to.

793
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
And I guess I could do that down here as well.

794
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:28,900
There we go.

795
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:37,600
So basically, I have my detail, X and D, Tau y, matte side, m d, Tau

796
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,300
y, x, 0, and tile side and M.

797
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,700
We don't really know yet.

798
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,800
What H RZ?

799
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,500
Really be.

800
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,200
In this case.

801
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,600
It's unclear that we ever want to actually have a DZ and this way, but

802
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,800
I'll put it to do in there to think about what we want to do about Z

803
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,700
because Z is really

804
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,300
Not a real dimension in our system, because since the way, Tom app

805
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,100
games work, you don't really have Z in the same way that you have X

806
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,500
and Y.

807
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,600
So, it's hard to say.

808
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,200
But anyway, after we compute these tile differences and then we

809
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,000
actually go ahead and do the math here, to add in the tile difference

810
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,400
amount.

811
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,500
Plus the offset amount.

812
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,100
Now, we've got a real d x d, y and easy, but of course, this is

813
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,300
actually all going to be in meters, but we need our M to pixels in

814
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,900
order to actually turn that into pixels on the screen.

815
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Green and these are all in pixels from here.

816
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,100
This is all rendering units.

817
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,400
So there's our meters to pixels that gets added in there.

818
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,400
To convert that difference that we did.

819
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,200
And of course, we have to pass the tile map as well, which I think is

820
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
just gamestate to market.

821
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,100
So, there we go.

822
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,400
And so, I believe that is roughly all we need to do to get that guy

823
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,100
going.

824
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,400
And of course.

825
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,200
Oh, I gotta return the result of course.

826
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,700
And so, I think that should be roughly.

827
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,500
Correct.

828
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,800
And, of course it isn't classically.

829
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
You gotta love that.

830
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,700
I think that's just because I forgot that we have to flip things

831
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,300
around for our are kind of non.

832
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,600
We don't really have a render yet.

833
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Like I said, so our coordinate systems are a little ad hoc here.

834
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,700
So, of course, yes, this is where we have to do.

835
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:27,000
Our flip always, which, you know, is kind of annoying at the moment,

836
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,200
but that will all get handled in our render for us.

837
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,900
So it's really, it's not as janky as it seems like it has to be the

838
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,600
fact that that the

839
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,100
The up-and-down doesn't quite work the way that we would like it to.

840
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,600
But anyway, so yes, what we would like to do here is we'd like to have

841
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,800
the player ideally go in the opposite direction.

842
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,300
Also, let me see here.

843
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,300
We should also make sure that we don't have a bug in our

844
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,600
in our offset X offset y stuff.

845
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
I don't think we do but we could double-check to make sure that we

846
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,400
don't.

847
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,600
So let's go ahead and double check everything here.

848
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,900
So we're going to take all of the tile cited M.

849
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,800
The dty, why is always going up?

850
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,100
It goes up in tiles as well as in as in r m units there, so that's

851
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,800
correct.

852
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,200
But yes, this this is this is wrong because obviously the guy is

853
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,900
supposed to go up, not the coordinates are inverted.

854
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,300
The renderer as from what they are in the game that didn't seem like

855
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,500
the bug.

856
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,600
We were having though, but I don't know.

857
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,100
Yes, we still get a weird.

858
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
We still get a little.

859
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Yeah, I was going to say it didn't that was that was one bug that we

860
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,100
had but I'm like, there's that weird kind of we get that kind of

861
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,100
nasty.

862
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,200
Thing where the x is, the x is related to the why I must have had a

863
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,100
typo in that code.

864
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,800
Let me go back and look at it for a second though.

865
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,500
Fantastic.

866
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:56,900
Yes.

867
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
I have tons of typos.

868
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,200
Wow.

869
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Those are amazing.

870
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,500
There we go.

871
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,500
All right.

872
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,900
So I think we are good to go.

873
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,500
Now.

874
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,900
Our dude is moving around to the camera is where it is supposed to be.

875
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,300
But we have a few other things that we would need to handle in order

876
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,500
to get everything working properly.

877
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,900
Also, I should note that we still have not finished our drawbitmap

878
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,500
routine.

879
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,900
So if we move to the top you'll notice I don't know if you can see

880
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,400
that.

881
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,900
That our guy doesn't actually he can't clip off the front, off the top

882
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,800
of the screen, we have a to do in there about that.

883
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,500
So those are the things that we have to finish.

884
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,800
So let's get him walking throughout the entire match.

885
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
For now, for example, when he comes off the top of the screen here,

886
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,400
you'll notice the camera will never change locations because we have

887
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,500
never actually program the camera to change locations.

888
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,600
So he is, and we and we also are drawing him, whether he's on the same

889
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,500
Z plane as the camera.

890
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,700
Not, so when Technically, when go upstairs will never actually see

891
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,200
that.

892
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,000
So we have a bunch of stuff that we need to fix.

893
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,300
So, let's go ahead and fix all those, we've got about 15 minutes left,

894
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,100
just so we can have things cleaned up and working relatively.

895
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,300
Well.

896
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
So we can start working on our math, having math.

897
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
With having real math is going to be a pretty nice thing.

898
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,500
Let me tell you, it's been a bit of a struggle to kind of go through

899
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,200
without ever having really vectors or anything like that.

900
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,300
But, you know, you got to pick an order to do things in, right?

901
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,800
And so it's always important to kind of, you know, not not go too far

902
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,500
too fast.

903
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,100
All right.

904
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,100
So, first things first, we always want to move the camera to wherever

905
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,000
the player is in Z, I would say, right?

906
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,400
So, no matter what happens.

907
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,500
I would say, the the camera P.

908
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I'm just going to say that the ABS tile Z is always going to be the

909
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,600
same as the player State AB style Z.

910
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,100
Right?

911
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,900
So, so what if the player goes up, then the camera goes up.

912
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,100
If the player goes down, it goes down and and so I think

913
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,600
Yeah, there you go.

914
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,800
So now we can actually get up and so the only thing that now we have a

915
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,100
problem.

916
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
I was at the player moves off the screen, the camera doesn't ever

917
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,700
follow them.

918
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,500
Right?

919
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
And that's no good.

920
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
So what we want to do here is we want to then say alright, the other

921
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,200
thing we need to do is to see whether the player ever gets more tiles

922
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,200
to the left or to the right.

923
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,400
Then you should be relative to the player.

924
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,700
Now, what we could do if we're always locked, two screens.

925
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,000
There's a lot of different ways we could do this.

926
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,900
You know, it depends, whether we want to drop down our own manual

927
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,900
camera points and, and this would allow us to do different things like

928
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,600
having screens of different scale.

929
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,100
Sometimes.

930
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,300
There's there's just a ton of stuff we could do here.

931
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,300
I'm trying to keep it again relatively simple because one thing at a

932
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,300
time, but we basically have a problem with our tiles X and tiles.

933
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,700
Why were we want to do is at the player.

934
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,500
Moves one screen to the right or once we left we want the camera to

935
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,100
follow them.

936
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,300
They're right.

937
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,000
And so the simplest way we might do that is just basically say if

938
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,900
we rounded the players position to whatever the

939
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,100
Closest Center screen center point was we want the camera to always be

940
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,400
looking at that, right?

941
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,900
And that's one way we could do it.

942
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm not sure if that's the smartest way to do it or not.

943
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,100
Yeah, it's really hard to say.

944
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,100
So one way, I mean, you know, let's let's let's put in something.

945
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,600
Let's put in something even simpler.

946
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,000
Let's say we've got this, diff this dysfunction here, right?

947
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,900
Like, so, oops.

948
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,200
In fact, I guess we don't even really need the diff function now that

949
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,000
I think about it.

950
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,400
Well, I guess we can tell, you know, kind of want it.

951
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,100
We can probably do want the diff function.

952
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,100
I don't know.

953
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,000
It's difficult to say, but I guess what we'll do for now is say,

954
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,700
alright, when the, when the we do the subtraction here.

955
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,900
Then basically what I'm going to do is say if the the Delta X is

956
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,200
greater than a certain amount, then I'm going to go ahead and move the

957
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,500
camera for words and if it's less than a certain amount, right?

958
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,100
I'm going to move the camera backwards.

959
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,700
Just going to see how that works out.

960
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,500
So basically how far is it?

961
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,700
Well, I'd say it's that 17 by 2 number again, right?

962
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,700
If the if he moves basically more than one screens worth away, then

963
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,800
he'll go ahead.

964
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,700
And do the change.

965
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,100
So I don't know.

966
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,300
Let's see what that number actually ends up.

967
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,800
Being if I have 17 tiles across.

968
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,900
As I think what we said, it was normally on the thing and so that's

969
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,100
eight.

970
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,000
Point five is the midpoint.

971
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,400
So eight tiles in the eighth tile, right?

972
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,200
We have seven tiles on one side, seven tiles on the other side and

973
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,700
then the middle tile, right?

974
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So basically if you were to get, let's say nine tiles away.

975
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,700
If you were to get nine tiles.

976
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,700
Away from the camera on the X direction.

977
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,900
That would be too many and we'd want to flip to the next screen.

978
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,800
So what we could do is say, all right, let's take 9.0.

979
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,400
F is the number times the tile side and M.

980
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,300
Right?

981
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,600
And that is basically going to tell us aside and M.

982
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,500
That's going to say that the player move too far away from the camera,

983
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:13,900
right?

984
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,200
I'm just going to go ahead and do that.

985
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,600
Like so and let's just see what that gets us.

986
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,100
Again.

987
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,800
We got to go upstairs first because we can't get out of this room.

988
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:29,700
So we go out there and then we go here and do that.

989
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,600
That is not.

990
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,200
Oh, well that did exactly what I told her to do.

991
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,700
We're supposed to move the full 17 tiles, but for some reason I only

992
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,000
had it moved one tile which is not really going to help us.

993
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Here to say the least.

994
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,600
Alright, let's try that again.

995
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,900
My bad.

996
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
That was that was that was not very bright.

997
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,400
So yes, if I go out here, now, we should see me come back on the other

998
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,200
side, which is exactly what happens.

999
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,700
And that's all good.

1000
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:01,000
Again.

1001
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,300
We still we have to go fix our problem so that this doesn't happen.

1002
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,800
So that's the next thing to do.

1003
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,600
And then we also have to fix up and down.

1004
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,200
So, here we go.

1005
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,900
I can walk out here and then I can kind of walk up Hoops up here.

1006
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,300
And this is the place where we would like to go off the screen.

1007
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,400
So again, hey, man, since we got Live code editing.

1008
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,100
I don't have to walk all the way back there.

1009
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
I can just go ahead and say let's duplicate this.

1010
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,900
And so, since it's nine in the direction, I guess that would mean it

1011
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,800
was for here is the tile side of M.

1012
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,800
And so the d y is going to basically do this, right?

1013
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,700
And that should give us some better motion up and down as well.

1014
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,200
Right?

1015
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,200
So when we walk off the end there, oh, okay, so it's actually sorry.

1016
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,800
It's not for its five-star was happening there, but we were right it's

1017
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,900
because we didn't Encompass that extra tile when we walked onto that

1018
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:56,400
tile.

1019
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,600
We were in neither as camera.

1020
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,800
Space the camera.

1021
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,500
I certainly would flip back and forth going.

1022
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh, I'm too far away.

1023
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Oh, I'm too far away.

1024
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,200
Oh, I'm too far away.

1025
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,800
So you actually have to do?

1026
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,100
Yeah.

1027
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,700
All the way to the end of that fifth tile or at least to the middle of

1028
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,800
it in order to not have that sort of problem.

1029
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,500
All right, so, I believe we can now walk all around the world with our

1030
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,000
guy which is nice.

1031
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,700
That's always good.

1032
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,100
It's kind of a happy little fellow.

1033
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,400
Well, he's determined you know, he's happy but he's determined, you

1034
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,700
know, that's how he is.

1035
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,800
So anyway, he's going to go out there.

1036
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,100
Let's go up there.

1037
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,800
See here.

1038
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,700
Go through here.

1039
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, so everything's nice and happy.

1040
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,300
Everything is good.

1041
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
No complaints.

1042
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,100
Alright, so basically all we really need to do now to keep to get

1043
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,400
ourselves back to a place, that's pretty stable for him walking around

1044
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,000
to where we can start to talk about wanting his movement code to be

1045
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,900
better, is is, you know, I'm, I'm walking out there and I'm clipping

1046
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,700
against the screen here.

1047
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,600
We just need to make sure that we do the math, right for clipping off.

1048
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,600
That edge of the screen.

1049
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
I think we already do the

1050
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,900
Right for clipping off the other edge of the screen, meaning that if I

1051
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
was going to go down.

1052
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,700
I think that works properly like so for example, going off the screen

1053
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,300
this way just works, right?

1054
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,700
So that's all fine.

1055
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,900
But it's that, it's that it's that coming in off the Min that we

1056
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,800
haven't done yet.

1057
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,800
So let's go ahead and do that and draw a bitmap.

1058
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,100
let's go ahead and

1059
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,000
make sure that this function now properly, handles, that you notice

1060
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,900
the to do here that we left in there, which is source for needs to be

1061
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,100
changed based on clipping.

1062
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,700
And so that's the problem.

1063
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,900
So basically what happens is our rectangle that were that were

1064
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,800
bleeding does properly get clipped.

1065
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,300
So we don't overwrite memory or do anything bad like that.

1066
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:47,500
But what we're not doing is advancing The Source row and the basically

1067
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
that starting pointer for where we're copying the pixels.

1068
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,400
We need to advance that by however much, we clipped the left and top

1069
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,800
edges of this bitmap.

1070
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,700
So basically this part right here, when we do this, we

1071
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Basically save an offset value.

1072
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,600
We need to save us like a source offset X and we need to save a source

1073
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,200
offset y to tell us why we should be fetching pixels further in

1074
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,800
because we are not drawing, the ones that are off the screen, right?

1075
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,200
And to make that a little clearer for folks who haven't done this sort

1076
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,000
of thing before, when we're normally drawing, right?

1077
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,200
What's happening, is if we're clipping off the other side of the

1078
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,000
screen, we don't have to adjust the point where we copy from, right?

1079
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,800
All we do is,

1080
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,800
Copy less.

1081
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,200
So when we copy a row, if we started here, all we have to know is will

1082
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,100
stop copying before you know, before you would have otherwise which

1083
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,100
would be all the way out here.

1084
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,500
But if we were to clip off, the Min edges of the screen, right?

1085
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,200
And the case like this, where we clipping off, both of the minimum

1086
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,900
edges, then we can't start copying from here.

1087
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,800
We actually need to start copying from here.

1088
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,800
And so we weren't doing that.

1089
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,300
And so obviously, we were going to have those graphical glitches

1090
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,400
because what was going to happen is we were going to start copying

1091
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,800
from here, but we were going to draw it to here.

1092
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,300
Which basically gives a phantom translation of our bitmap down and to

1093
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,500
the right and it makes it look like a stops early because this is

1094
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,000
still the clipping for it.

1095
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,400
So it's basically translated our guy this way and clipped him.

1096
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,600
So he would just you'd see like his head like there.

1097
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,900
When his head should be up here, off-screen and his body should be

1098
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,200
here.

1099
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:18,700
Right?

1100
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,300
So, all we need to do is just advance that pointer pre advance that

1101
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,400
pointer to the right location and that will totally fix the bug that

1102
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,000
we have.

1103
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,400
So all we need to do here is basically go.

1104
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:29,800
All right.

1105
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,000
Right, we have this which is our source row, but we could go ahead

1106
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,500
right now and update it to say that whatever our set X is, will move

1107
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,500
that many pixels in and whatever our offset Y is well, multiply that

1108
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,400
by the bitmap with right and that will offset it by that number of

1109
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,900
rows.

1110
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,900
So that way we'll get, you know, the, the row offset and the column

1111
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,300
offset.

1112
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,300
We're all good there.

1113
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,800
So all we need to do now is actually store them.

1114
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,900
And of course, it's whatever it was, whatever this value was.

1115
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,300
That this negative value is how is we want to offset by the off the

1116
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,300
opposite of that?

1117
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,900
Right?

1118
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,800
So there we go, and now we should be copying this guy well, or we'll

1119
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,800
just go ahead and just straight-up fucking crash.

1120
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,300
Because it's amateur programming, our here on handmade hero.

1121
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,900
Apparently, I don't know exactly what I did there.

1122
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,300
Oh, right.

1123
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,700
Because because I forgot that this bitmap is bottom up, right?

1124
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,300
So basically we have to actually go down.

1125
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,200
We have to actually subtract for each of the thesaurus offsets.

1126
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,700
Yeah, not not, not the brightest move by Casey.

1127
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,300
It's true.

1128
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,500
But again, a lot of this stuff is just since this is test code.

1129
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,500
You can't expect me to remember all that stuff when we actually are

1130
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,400
doing the full render.

1131
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,800
Coded lot of this will be more commented and more directly will have

1132
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,000
bullet down more and then you can get mad at me.

1133
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,200
So I'm not going to allow a shame that that was not an ALICE.

1134
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,700
Shame moment, my opinion.

1135
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,200
I'm going to give myself a by on that one.

1136
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,100
All right.

1137
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,300
So anyway, I think our dude.

1138
00:50:59,500 --> 00:50:59,900
Is pretty much.

1139
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,200
Okay.

1140
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,900
Now you can see how he Clips properly now off either edge of the

1141
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,400
screen.

1142
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,500
So that's all good.

1143
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,900
We'll try it on up as well just to make sure that.

1144
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,000
Yep, that's all good up and down seem to be good there.

1145
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,300
No issues.

1146
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:13,800
Yeah.

1147
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,300
Yeah, everything is fine.

1148
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,000
Okay, so he can go adventure around are very sparse, and not

1149
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,200
particular, interesting world.

1150
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,300
But at least everything is working the way that we think that it

1151
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,700
should.

1152
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,700
And so that's good.

1153
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,300
That's all very nice and good.

1154
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,800
The other thing that we probably should do it.

1155
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,600
Some point here is check our frame rate because of course at the

1156
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,500
current moment, you know, we have, we're doing this rendering code

1157
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,000
without any optimizations.

1158
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
It's not Cindy, it's not optimized at all.

1159
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's crazy.

1160
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
And so we should trouble trouble.

1161
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,800
We verify that all this crazy stuff that we did without any thought to

1162
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
the performance of it whatsoever.

1163
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,900
And we're not again.

1164
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,200
We're also not even using GPU.

1165
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,300
So we're at a severe, disadvantage performance-wise here.

1166
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,400
So we should actually just go and check because we still haven't had a

1167
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,000
chance to do anything in terms of a heads up.

1168
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Display for ourselves.

1169
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,300
I just want to take a quick second to look to see what our frame rate

1170
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,400
actually is in practice.

1171
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,900
So let's take a look at that.

1172
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,100
And it looks like we're still, okay.

1173
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,200
We are hearing that that 30 frames per second goal.

1174
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,000
And so we are, we are in good shape.

1175
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,500
All right, even with all of that pickiness, so I think that's about

1176
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,800
everything that I wanted to do today.

1177
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,500
I can't think if there's anything else that I thought that I needed to

1178
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:26,700
do.

1179
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't think so.

1180
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,800
So, maybe let's go ahead.

1181
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,100
And go to the Q&A a little bit early.

1182
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,600
I'm trying to think if there's anything else.

1183
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,400
Oh, well, you know what?

1184
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,000
There is one thing we could do that.

1185
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,800
I wanted to mention, I mentioned this in the forums to people because

1186
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,900
they were having trouble with it and I just hadn't had time to do it

1187
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,500
myself.

1188
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,100
We could just throw it at the end here.

1189
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,800
And that is that since we're doing our Live code loading.

1190
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,000
Sometimes the problem, a problem happens with Microsoft Visual Studio,

1191
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,200
which is that when the compiler writes out the executable, it

1192
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,600
sometimes writes this cutable first and the pdb.

1193
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,500
Well, I think it always actually does that.

1194
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,700
And and so the pdb actually finishes writing after the executable

1195
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,200
finishes writing, in this case.

1196
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,500
I should say dll because it's the dll that we actually care about.

1197
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:13,200
So we write that dll out and then the pdb gets written out.

1198
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,700
When our hot loader goes to load the executable in, it will load that

1199
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,300
executable almost immediately because remember we're running it, you

1200
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,900
know, 30 frames a second here.

1201
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,700
So it's going to load it very, very soon and the pdb sometimes hasn't

1202
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,400
finished writing.

1203
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,600
So what will happen is Visual Studio, will fail to load the pdb, and

1204
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:29,800
then we

1205
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,700
Can't set our break points and stuff, right?

1206
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,600
Because the pdb is still open for writing.

1207
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,700
So what I want to do is to show a little trick that we can do here to

1208
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,500
avoid that problem, people were having trouble with this on the forums

1209
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,400
and I told them how to fix it.

1210
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,200
But I figured people on the stream should know as well, and that's

1211
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,800
basically just to create a lock file.

1212
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,400
So, all we really have to do is just in, in the direction, the

1213
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,400
directory, where we're going to put that dll, right.

1214
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,000
All we really need to do is we just need to put a lock file in there

1215
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,600
and so we can say waiting for pdb and we can

1216
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,900
Put that out to like lock dot temp or something.

1217
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,500
And then when we are done will delete that locked up temp file, right?

1218
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,900
And that locked out temp file.

1219
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:14,500
Basically just says don't load right now because whatever you're going

1220
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,300
to load is going to be stale.

1221
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,100
And so if we look at what happens, if I do that, when I'm doing this

1222
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,900
compiled here, it's probably hard to see because you can't actually we

1223
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,400
probably can't catch it in time.

1224
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,700
Well, you know what I could do.

1225
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,400
I might be able to.

1226
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,800
Oops, I might be able to show it here.

1227
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm not sure if I will, or will or will not be able to catch it.

1228
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,100
But essentially, if you think about it this way, where's my build up

1229
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,400
that handmade?

1230
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,100
Note that bat.

1231
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,700
I know if you can see it show up there a tall boots.

1232
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,800
That's not right.

1233
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,200
Build that that

1234
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,800
I don't know if you can see.

1235
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,000
It.

1236
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,600
Show up there.

1237
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,500
Probably not.

1238
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,200
Yeah, it never actually it never actually puts forth.

1239
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,800
Does it?

1240
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,900
Let's see if I can get it to go.

1241
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,100
There.

1242
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,300
It was lock it down.

1243
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,800
And if you can see that pause the stream, anyway, there's a locked up

1244
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,500
temp file, now that gets created there and that locked up temp file

1245
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,100
will not get deleted.

1246
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,400
Hopefully until after the pdb is loaded, because the compiler will

1247
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,200
have returned entirely at that time.

1248
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,400
So once we know that there is that lock file in place.

1249
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,400
That's just a dummy file.

1250
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,000
That's there to let us know when that thing started and ended right

1251
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
what I can do.

1252
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,700
Is I can go ahead and just test to see if the lock file is there and

1253
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,200
assume that whatever compilation has to be going on?

1254
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,800
No matter how complicated, this thing gets will always wait and we

1255
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,600
won't delete the lock file until all the things that we need to have

1256
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,500
happened before the hot loading occurs have occurred, right?

1257
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,800
And so when we do that, sort of load game code thing and I mean,

1258
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,900
remember where that is at this point.

1259
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,400
It's a load game code.

1260
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,600
What we'll do is we can actually say when we go to load that game

1261
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,200
code.

1262
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,900
I think this thing actually sets.

1263
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,800
Let's see here.

1264
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,500
Yeah, this thing gets the that dll.

1265
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,400
Last right time.

1266
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,200
So what we could do is when we actually go to load the game code, we

1267
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,300
could check to make sure that the lock file is not there.

1268
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,400
Right?

1269
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,800
And we have two places, technically, we could do that.

1270
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,600
We could do that really in either position and I don't know which one

1271
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,800
we would like to do.

1272
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:22,900
It's

1273
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,000
Hard to say.

1274
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,500
I think we probably just want to do it here.

1275
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:32,300
So I think we want to do and why is this still there?

1276
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,200
I believe we are getting the proper path.

1277
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,400
I think we're doing both of those two dues.

1278
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,100
We need to go check to make sure we have a lot of to do is lying

1279
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,100
around there and have to be there.

1280
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:45,600
So basically what we could do right here is just go ahead and and do

1281
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,000
the if right here to see whether or not that lock file actually

1282
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,600
exists.

1283
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,100
And so I think the easiest way to do that

1284
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,800
That is just to do like a maybe a get file attributes or something

1285
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,200
like that.

1286
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,800
Let me see what.

1287
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,700
Easiest way is to do that in.

1288
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:10,700
To see whether that that file exists, I think actually to file exists.

1289
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,400
It's it get file attributes.

1290
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,600
I don't actually know path exists.

1291
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,200
Don't think that's a good.

1292
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,800
I don't think that's actually the function that we want.

1293
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,500
Windows 2000, professional.

1294
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
Requires floppy.

1295
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,400
Yeah, I don't actually know if we want.

1296
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,400
That doesn't seem like a good thing.

1297
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:35,900
Get file attributes, might be the easiest zip file, attribute CX.

1298
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,000
Let's see about that guy.

1299
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,900
I could also look, I don't think there's a file exists, functional

1300
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,500
think there is.

1301
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,400
Look at double check file exists, path exists copy file now.

1302
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,900
So let's go ahead and use get file attribute CX and basically that

1303
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,300
should return false if we can actually get it, right.

1304
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,900
So we'll just call will literally just call this thing right?

1305
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,500
Like so and if it actually if it actually was there, then we'll be

1306
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,900
good to go this.

1307
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,700
Okay, so,

1308
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,700
We need to do here is we need to have that file name, whatever that

1309
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,100
foul name actually has to be.

1310
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,600
And so it's going to be sore stealing on the attempt telling him and

1311
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,900
lock file name, right?

1312
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,600
Like that.

1313
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,900
And so, we'll go ahead and pass that lock file name.

1314
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,400
Now, whatever.

1315
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,100
We do went through to load code.

1316
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:30,600
We need to do lock full path.

1317
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:39,800
And or I guess it's a game code lock full path that Source game code

1318
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,500
dll.

1319
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,500
And so here I should just be able to do temp with lock.

1320
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,700
There we go.

1321
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,300
Lock full path.

1322
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,500
And that's I think just called it.

1323
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,600
Locked up temp and there we go.

1324
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,300
So I think oops, I think that should be sufficient.

1325
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:03,900
I'm not sure.

1326
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,800
I think it is.

1327
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,100
And so let's take a look.

1328
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,600
So if I go in here.

1329
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,100
Well, evidently not.

1330
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,200
Oh.

1331
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
I did it backwards again.

1332
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,100
Get file attributes.

1333
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,500
So it's basically, if not, it's supposed to be, if we don't see the

1334
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,100
file, right, it should load.

1335
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,000
And so I think that should be fine.

1336
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,600
But let me just test to make sure that we still have our hot loading.

1337
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,400
Um enabled.

1338
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,500
So okay.

1339
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,900
Let's go got this guy going.

1340
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,300
I'll make a new frame.

1341
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:35,800
Maybe.

1342
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,600
Oh, the Hideous colors.

1343
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,200
Maybe I won't make a new frame.

1344
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,800
So I'll just move this guy down here.

1345
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:47,400
I guess we could go ahead and and do a loop for now.

1346
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,600
Let's go ahead and make him go up.

1347
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,000
Here.

1348
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,100
We okay.

1349
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,900
And so, I don't know.

1350
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
What do we want to do?

1351
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,800
Let's see if our live coded.

1352
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,400
We'll Live code, edit him to go backwards instead.

1353
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,700
So I'll go in here to handmade dot CPP and go to the facing Direction

1354
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,200
stuff.

1355
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,900
And basically, I'll just say, oh, yeah, whenever he is going to the

1356
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,700
right.

1357
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,400
Let's actually make them face left and vice versa.

1358
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:18,600
Yeah.

1359
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,100
There we go.

1360
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,900
So should be good.

1361
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:22,900
Yeah.

1362
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:25,900
Yeah.

1363
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:27,200
All right.

1364
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,300
I'm satisfied.

1365
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,100
Okay, so

1366
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,100
I believe we now do need to go back to our originally scheduled

1367
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,500
program.

1368
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,600
We're a little bit over now.

1369
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,400
Three minutes over the Q&A.

1370
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,700
Now that we have taken care of that, I think everything is is, is

1371
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,000
kosher now with that.

1372
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,600
Yes.

1373
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,300
I believe it is.

1374
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,000
So let us go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1375
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,900
Now that we've finished that, if you would like to have me, answer

1376
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,600
question, please, put Q: in front of it, so that I will see it.

1377
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,200
I and that starts now anything that you've put

1378
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,800
That's Q:.

1379
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:03,500
I won't see.

1380
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,800
It's anything that starts now and has a cute: front of it.

1381
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,800
I will I will take a look at and please try to keep the questions.

1382
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,200
Two things that happened on today's stream or previous streams.

1383
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,200
So please try to save off, topic questions or things about what we're

1384
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,300
going to do in the future for a pre streams.

1385
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,600
I try to show up about 15 minutes, early to most streams.

1386
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,600
I can't always make it but I try to and I answer off-topic questions

1387
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,200
at that time.

1388
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,400
So if you're interested in asking off-topic questions, that's totally

1389
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,900
fine, but come before the stream to do those.

1390
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,100
So, most of the time I try to be here before them, so yeah.

1391
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,500
Let's see.

1392
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,400
Genetic species.

1393
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,600
Can you do that live code with a function call?

1394
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,400
That could just be a poke.

1395
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:53,900
Hmm.

1396
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,200
I'm sorry.

1397
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,800
I'm not sure what that means.

1398
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,500
Can you do that live code with a function call.

1399
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,700
Could you be more specific, perhaps?

1400
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,600
Let's see.

1401
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,700
Enumerations.

1402
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,500
Am I correct to say you've not used them in handmade hero yet.

1403
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,400
I'm guessing this is simply because it's too early to know.

1404
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,700
What will eventually require a new enumerations and not some other

1405
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,100
reason did we really never use an enum?

1406
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,300
That may be true.

1407
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,300
We may never.

1408
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,600
Yeah, so we haven't ever.

1409
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,700
I do use enums.

1410
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,400
I'm not avoiding them for any particular reason.

1411
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,400
We just haven't had like sets of types or anything.

1412
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,100
Probably.

1413
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,200
When we do like entities, you know, our entity types might be an

1414
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,600
enumeration or something like that, you know, but yeah, I'm not

1415
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,100
avoiding them.

1416
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:35,400
We just

1417
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,900
I guess I just hadn't come up yet.

1418
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,300
Why not layer?

1419
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,100
The individual body parts into a single bitmap that way you only have

1420
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,800
to draw one image instead of three.

1421
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,400
Well,

1422
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
That's a very good question.

1423
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,200
And hopefully this is a very good answer for you.

1424
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,300
I want him to be very bouncy.

1425
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,700
So I want him to kind of hop along and I want the three parts to kind

1426
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,800
of do this sort of a thing, right?

1427
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,400
So, I asked, young-shin to make sure that they were separate so that

1428
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,800
he could kind of be like a little springy guy that Springs around.

1429
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,400
And in addition to like, squashing and stretching the bitmaps.

1430
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,300
I also want them to move relative to each other, if that makes sense

1431
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,700
to really kind of give that sense of, you know, motion.

1432
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,100
Are you wearing a blue Cape like the handmade hero today?

1433
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,500
No, it's not a cape.

1434
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,400
It's just a shirt.

1435
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:31,400
I don't actually have a cape, a handmade hero Cape, but see, I just

1436
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,900
want to point out.

1437
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,500
There is a magnifying tool in windows that came with arrow.

1438
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:34,900
Yes.

1439
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,700
It's true.

1440
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,400
Unfortunately, it's really hard to use.

1441
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:38,900
At least.

1442
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,200
I find it hard to use.

1443
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,800
I like this other tool called zoom in which I just haven't gotten

1444
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:48,800
around to finding, I don't know where it is.

1445
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,800
I may have to copy it from.

1446
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,800
Like an old version of Microsoft developer Studio or something, but it

1447
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,800
was so much easier to use than the than the one that came with than

1448
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,000
the one that they ship.

1449
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,600
Now.

1450
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,400
Let's see if they've got this zoom in.

1451
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,800
I don't know if this is someone else's stupid zoom in.

1452
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,200
I want the actual.

1453
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,000
I want the actual zoom in that used to come with the dev tools.

1454
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,600
So there used to be one and Microsoft.

1455
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,400
UK tools.

1456
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:29,400
Yeah.

1457
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:30,700
Yeah.

1458
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,100
I'll have to go hunt for it.

1459
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,300
I'll have to go hunt hunt for it because that's the one.

1460
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,500
I actually want.

1461
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,800
I suppose I could use color Cup.

1462
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,000
In fact, maybe I should just use color cop because color cops.

1463
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Pretty awesome.

1464
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,300
Yeah.

1465
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,100
But looks like it doesn't do real-time.

1466
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:55,700
Oh well.

1467
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,200
Yeah, I don't know.

1468
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,900
I want to go get that zoom in tool because I don't like the one that

1469
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,600
comes there and that's why I haven't been using it.

1470
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,200
It's too hard to use in my opinion.

1471
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:09,600
And he's SZ.

1472
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,800
Don't you want to test the bugging?

1473
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,900
You can't really.

1474
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,100
We'll just have to see if we no longer hit the problem because there's

1475
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,800
no way to tell whether or not we just got lucky you just you.

1476
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,000
So you just have to do that the test.

1477
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,100
It like, lots of times.

1478
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:25,400
You can't write because it was only, sometimes that msec didn't

1479
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,800
actually do the reload.

1480
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,200
So I just wanted to test just that much and then we'll see as we go

1481
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:29,700
forwards.

1482
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:33,200
If we have, if we have the problem where it can set breakpoints.

1483
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,400
Girl and a boom.

1484
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,000
Oh, no, I swore, I didn't mean to swear.

1485
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,500
Oh, that's the second time.

1486
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,300
Oh my goodness.

1487
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:48,600
I don't know.

1488
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,100
Even what I said, that's how bad of a swear that was.

1489
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,400
That's awful.

1490
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,400
Okay.

1491
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,400
I'm trying to keep this the language.

1492
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:57,800
Okay?

1493
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
For kids and

1494
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,200
You know, normally I swear a lot.

1495
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,200
I will tell you so it's been rather difficult.

1496
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Can you add a standard def include to handmade platform.sh?

1497
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:10,800
Sure.

1498
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:12,600
I can do that.

1499
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,900
In fact, people have been asking for a few things in here.

1500
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,000
One was to get standard def in there.

1501
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,300
So that platforms could get some platforms.

1502
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,800
Want that for size T, this guy right here?

1503
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,800
And so that the other thing people were asking for is they were asking

1504
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,200
if maybe the utility functions could be moved in there because they

1505
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,800
were having trouble compiling.

1506
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,100
Well, in fact, you can kind of see what they are.

1507
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:36,600
Basically.

1508
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:36,700
We're

1509
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:39,900
Still using handmade .h in win32.

1510
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,700
And so what I could do is I could I could force it to stop doing that

1511
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:50,000
and just do handmade platform.sh, and that would tell us what our,

1512
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,400
what our stuff is that we're missing.

1513
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,300
Right?

1514
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:59,800
And so we would need to move in basically all of this stuff for the

1515
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,200
most part.

1516
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,700
So we would need to move in to the platform layer all of this code, I

1517
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,200
think.

1518
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,800
Probably, let's see here in there.

1519
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,500
I don't know what else and get controller.

1520
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,200
So, get controller would have to be in there as well.

1521
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,200
Whereas get controller.

1522
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,500
So those are the things that the platform layer was currently calling.

1523
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,100
And I don't know that I really want all of those in the platform.sh at

1524
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,000
the end of the day.

1525
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,800
Oops, move that down a little bit.

1526
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,000
Yeah.

1527
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,700
And so yeah, I don't know if I want all of those things.

1528
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,100
Is in there that may not be the best idea.

1529
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,800
But at least now we compile clean.

1530
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,900
So people who are reporting to other platforms, can go ahead and do

1531
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,000
that.

1532
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,500
So hopefully that helps them out a little bit.

1533
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,700
Just making sure that they see our win32 layer, just only includes

1534
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,700
handmade platform.sh and that's a little more consistent and make it a

1535
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,600
little easier for them.

1536
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,200
Why does the guy have no feet?

1537
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,000
Well?

1538
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:02,900
I mean.

1539
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,900
if you look,

1540
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,400
That right there should tell you why he has no feet.

1541
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:22,300
How do you know which compiler options like CLR and standard headers?

1542
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,100
You want to use?

1543
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,899
I'm not sure what you mean by that.

1544
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:31,600
Exactly.

1545
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,899
I mean, essentially, my general rule for for standard headers and

1546
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,800
compilers is that you want to include everything in the platform layer

1547
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,200
and you want to include as little as possible in the main code.

1548
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:51,700
So you would, ideally, I feel like you wouldn't want any includes in

1549
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,399
the in the stuff that gets actually included in the game, but the

1550
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:58,700
bottom line is that's not actually physically possible, mostly.

1551
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,899
time, because you need to get

1552
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,100
Little bit of information.

1553
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,899
I mean, you could duplicate what was basically happening in these

1554
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,300
headers so you could do that.

1555
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,100
But for the most part, what you're trying to do is minimize the stuff

1556
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:13,100
that you're including to only be definitions of stuff that you

1557
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,700
actually need in terms of types, but you don't want to include

1558
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,200
anything else for the most part.

1559
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,200
That's the way I usually like to do it because I like to make sure

1560
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,100
that all of my code is in my code and I don't call out into the

1561
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,300
library for anything so that I know absolutely everything that's going

1562
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,000
on and I can guarantee that everything is portable and so on and so

1563
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,399
forth.

1564
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:34,899
But yeah, that's just me in terms of in general how you decide what

1565
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:35,500
you want to do?

1566
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,899
It's whatever you want to use.

1567
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:41,700
Like, I mean if you want to use stuff, I mean basically the way too.

1568
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:47,200
To know about size T is just that if you go to us, any kind of

1569
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,800
reference on C++ or C, you can kind of see like what it gets what you

1570
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,100
need to include to use it.

1571
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,600
So for example, in C++, if you're using the standard size T it tells

1572
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,100
you here, like that's the include that that comes with.

1573
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:06,100
If you're looking at the C library, know where that would be.

1574
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,100
Exactly.

1575
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,500
I know who says where that is.

1576
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,700
Here you go, there to find the header file standard def dot h, so you

1577
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:22,400
kind of have to go hunting for them or you can search in your C,

1578
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,100
compilers include directory, to try to find where they are, but it can

1579
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,800
be a little hairy.

1580
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,500
When you're like I want to use this language feature.

1581
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,000
Where is it?

1582
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,600
Right, so I don't know.

1583
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,500
So I don't know if that's exactly what you're asking.

1584
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,600
If you want to ask a more specifically, I can try to answer it.

1585
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,900
Maybe perhaps a little bit better.

1586
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,800
Changing the literal value of a variable is a peek and poke technique

1587
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,300
poking a value into memory address 0.

1588
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,200
I see what you're asking.

1589
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,600
Okay.

1590
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,600
Yes for the Live code.

1591
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,700
It is not poke based for what you're saying.

1592
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:05,400
It is full on Live code.

1593
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,800
So for example, what we were doing there is when like, for example,

1594
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,600
you're moving this guy around, we could actually, you know, change the

1595
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,900
code to do anything.

1596
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:16,600
We wanted.

1597
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,100
We could, we could change it to do absolutely anything.

1598
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,800
So, for example, we could just go into the actual code where the guy

1599
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,900
was, was being drawn right in the drawbitmap.

1600
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,600
Code and we could just fall on, you know, drum or heads, right?

1601
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,500
I mean, if we wanted to, we could just, we could just do you know,

1602
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,300
anything, and there's a second head on the guy.

1603
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,800
Maybe we could, we could go in and say, we want to draw.

1604
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:44,000
Lots of heads on the guy head, count or head index equals zero head,

1605
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,400
index is less than 10, plus, plus head index.

1606
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,400
And then, you know, you get into this kind of a situation where you

1607
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,500
just have so many heads.

1608
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,300
You don't really know.

1609
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,100
Oops, it mean, header and head.

1610
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,800
EXO, right, and this is still all running.

1611
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,800
You know, totally fine and you can like I do the loop Live code

1612
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,800
editing thing that I was doing before, where the, dude kind of does

1613
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,700
whatever his thing is that he does.

1614
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,500
And that can be running all the while if you want to write.

1615
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,400
And so, I can switch up what I'm doing here.

1616
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:20,100
I can I can remove that and just draw one of them, right, like that.

1617
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,300
I could, I could do anything I wanted to.

1618
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,300
So yeah, we've got, we've got pretty much as hardcore Live code

1619
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,900
editing, as you can get in a reasonable amount.

1620
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,500
Out of time.

1621
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,400
I have some harder core stuff where you can actually change data

1622
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:39,400
structure layouts that I've done in the past, but that's a huge thing

1623
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,700
that would take many hours of explaining on the stream.

1624
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,500
So I decided not to do that one, but we've basically got as hardcore,

1625
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,200
as you can go without that.

1626
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,800
So yeah, it's pretty awesome too.

1627
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,600
We haven't had a lot of chance to use it yet because we're not tuning

1628
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,900
stuff at this point, really, where this becomes really great and we'll

1629
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,900
see this possibly next week or maybe the week.

1630
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,800
After is, when you're trying to tune, like the feel of an animation,

1631
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,500
like in that movement code, or whatever being able to do this, where

1632
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,100
you can just see them walking around and tune it and tune it in tune.

1633
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,300
It is pretty awesome.

1634
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,500
So I'm looking forward to that.

1635
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,200
What will happen if you have an item that is in front in one view, but

1636
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,700
in the back on another since it seems you've hard-coded the order in

1637
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,900
which they're drawn, what you reorder them based on The View or some

1638
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,400
other rendering technique, so it depends largely.

1639
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,400
I suspect that the way you're.

1640
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,100
Okay.

1641
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,600
So this is just some code that we put in here.

1642
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:52,100
I feel like I say this a lot, but I guess it doesn't necessarily often

1643
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:52,800
come through.

1644
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,200
All of this is test code.

1645
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,900
None of the code that we have written in anything.

1646
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,600
In here.

1647
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,500
We'll actually get used, right.

1648
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,700
It's all spec'ing out our game engine.

1649
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,100
So we will not be drawing the player.

1650
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:10,100
Anything like this, in the shipping version of the game, right?

1651
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,300
It will literally bear.

1652
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,200
Absolutely, no resemblance to going on.

1653
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,300
What's going on here?

1654
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,200
All of the stuff.

1655
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,100
We are learning and that I'm explaining while we go through, it will

1656
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,400
absolutely be important because we every single last thing that we've

1657
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,600
learned here will be crucial.

1658
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,700
All in are making the engine good but none of this is how you would

1659
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:29,600
actually do it.

1660
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:33,700
So when I say that I'm just drawing a couple things in here so we can

1661
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,900
put the hero in that's literally what I mean.

1662
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,000
What we will actually be doing is we'll actually have a number of ways

1663
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
in which things actually get sorted into the scene and you'll see that

1664
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,800
once we actually get to the point where we have a renderer as opposed

1665
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
to just some test code.

1666
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,600
Thank sense.

1667
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,900
Why don't you use the emacs calc?

1668
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:54,800
The reason is actually cuz I have not bound to key to it yet.

1669
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,800
I only just figured out that it was there like accidentally on the

1670
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,700
Basically, Mac sakie Max has so much stuff in it that I only know,

1671
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:04,900
like .5 percent of the things that are in there.

1672
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,200
And so I need to remember to bind a key to it eventually so that I can

1673
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,700
just quickly hid it in calc.

1674
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,000
So I have to meta X quick Dash, calc blah blah blah takes too long.

1675
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,800
But yeah, I'm going to bind a few to at some point.

1676
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,600
Oh, someone is saying that maybe I can get zoom in at

1677
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,000
sysinternals.com.

1678
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,000
Is that true?

1679
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,600
Salinas utilities.

1680
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,500
Zoom it.

1681
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:45,800
Zoom.

1682
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,800
It is different than zoom in.

1683
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:53,400
Hmm.

1684
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:57,800
Interesting.

1685
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,000
Huh?

1686
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,200
Well, to be honest with you though.

1687
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,700
I'm kind of curious about that.

1688
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,000
And since I obviously love Mark russinovich.

1689
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,000
I might be inclined to take a look at that guy.

1690
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,100
I did kind of want zoom in but Zoom, it sounds like fun.

1691
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:18,900
I will say.

1692
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,700
So maybe we'll check that out.

1693
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:21,700
Yeah.

1694
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,300
All right.

1695
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,600
Thank you for mentioning that that could, that could be useful.

1696
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:26,900
Let's go ahead.

1697
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:28,200
Close that down there.

1698
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,900
When you pan off the Min edges, can you explain how the head was

1699
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,900
redrawing over the body?

1700
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,400
So,

1701
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,800
Redrawing over the body.

1702
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:51,200
I'm not sure what you mean by the head was redrawing over the body.

1703
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,500
Well, I mean, I can sort of just quickly go through what was happening

1704
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:01,300
there and hopefully answer the question as part of that.

1705
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,300
So and just for the fellow who was asking about how extensive are Live

1706
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:13,600
code editing was, I will go ahead and and introduce a bug in the code

1707
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,700
while it's live.

1708
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,100
There we go.

1709
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,700
Um, all right, so I'm going to turn off the looped live coding here

1710
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:27,500
and go ahead and and get us to a point where we could actually see

1711
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,600
that that happening.

1712
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,000
So this is what was happening, right?

1713
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:38,500
You can see that bug now that I've commented out the line so the head

1714
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,400
wasn't redrawing over the body.

1715
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,100
That was not actually what's happening.

1716
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,900
What's happening is once we hit the minimum edge of the screen, right?

1717
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:48,000
So remember the bitmap is

1718
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,000
bigger here because there's just a bunch of alpha empty Alpha around

1719
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,800
that guy once we hit the edge of the screen and we keep going forward,

1720
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:58,900
what we're essentially doing is we've, we are now clipping the blit

1721
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,700
rectangle like the

1722
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
Rectangle is like this big, right?

1723
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,300
And in fact, you know, what, I could do to just to show this to you.

1724
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,100
I could go ahead and write in here.

1725
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,000
The, our Channel always on, for example, like I could do something

1726
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,900
like this, right?

1727
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:25,100
Oh, but I have to do it just for dudes just for the little dude there.

1728
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,300
Hmm, how do I do that?

1729
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,500
Well, the way I could do that is say if I was clipped I suppose.

1730
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,700
So I could do I could I could do it this way.

1731
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:41,300
If what did I call that variable?

1732
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:49,400
Source offset, so if sores are set X or Source offset, y draw, the red

1733
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:49,800
Channel.

1734
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:51,900
Oops.

1735
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:58,600
So what I've done is, I've made it so that you can see the entire area

1736
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,400
of the blit.

1737
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,900
Once it starts clipping, when it Clips off the minimum Edge, right?

1738
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,900
So hopefully, you can see what happens.

1739
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,000
I move up there and now my rectangle is flush against the side.

1740
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:14,000
As I move further over our rectangle properly Clips to the size that

1741
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:14,600
it should be.

1742
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,700
It correctly sets, the size of the blind.

1743
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:22,600
But it is not changing the offset in the bitmap where it's copying the

1744
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,400
values from.

1745
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,500
So it's always copying as if it were going to copy the whole thing,

1746
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,100
but it just gets clipped out entirely right?

1747
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,700
As that as the rectangle shrinks and shrinks its only copying less and

1748
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,100
less.

1749
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,800
So what we need to do to fix that problem is we need to copy from

1750
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,500
further in at the bitmap.

1751
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,800
As we fall off this edge of the screen.

1752
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,400
We need to move in on the source.

1753
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,800
The place for copying from.

1754
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,100
We need to move in.

1755
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,600
That he moves over even though he's only copying a little bit.

1756
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,000
So it's copying this, you know, this part from the rightmost edge of

1757
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,800
the bitmap basis.

1758
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,700
You could think about it as doing that, right?

1759
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,300
And so when that happens, right?

1760
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,200
Go ahead and turn the bug off.

1761
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:07,100
Now, what's going to happen is essentially, you can still see it's

1762
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,800
only bleeding.

1763
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,900
This this piece, right?

1764
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:10,800
It's only bleeding that rectangle right there.

1765
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,200
But what it's doing, is it skipping?

1766
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,200
When it copies a row.

1767
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:20,300
It's skipping the first n pixels where n is however, many however far

1768
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,900
off the edge, we were right.

1769
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,300
And so that allows them to move all the way off, right?

1770
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,900
So does that make a little more sense?

1771
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,300
Right.

1772
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,500
We didn't have to do that.

1773
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,200
When we were flipping on the other side of the screen because on the

1774
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,800
other side of the screen, we know we're going from the left to the

1775
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,400
right when we copy a row.

1776
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,200
So all we had to do was stopped early.

1777
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,500
So the this this for Loop that's going to a Max X.

1778
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,900
When we clip the max X that just that just works that just solves the

1779
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:46,200
problem.

1780
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,800
Right there.

1781
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,500
We set the max X right here.

1782
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,900
Right here, right?

1783
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,600
When the max X is greater than the buffer with.

1784
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,200
So when the max X would be off this Edge, we go ahead and stop it and

1785
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,700
we set it to that edge.

1786
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,700
All we need to do because we just stop copying the road, right?

1787
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,000
We just stop copying the road early.

1788
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,500
That's it.

1789
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,600
Right, but when we're oops, trying to move the guy by clicking the

1790
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,800
keyboard when I'm focused in the other room window, but on the other

1791
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Edge, it's not that simple.

1792
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,200
Because if we were to just stop copying the row early, we get what we

1793
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,000
saw before, where the guy appears to stop.

1794
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,900
I'll get clamp against that edge because it's still copying the

1795
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,300
pixels.

1796
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,600
From the beginning of the bitmap where we don't want to copy those

1797
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,800
pixels, right?

1798
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,200
So hopefully that makes more sense.

1799
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,900
I'll go ahead and remove

1800
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
of that there and there you go.

1801
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,200
So now we're back to normal.

1802
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,200
Can't wait to do better player movement code.

1803
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:44,800
It's awful.

1804
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,000
Trying to get through these doors.

1805
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,400
Yeah, I'm just like every time I try to go through a drawing, like I

1806
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,300
gotta fix that.

1807
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,700
Do you ever write tests or does the average game?

1808
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,200
Not have unit tests?

1809
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,700
Well, so unit tests.

1810
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,000
I've covered this a couple times before.

1811
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,200
I'll just say quickly again.

1812
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,400
Unit tests aren't very useful in games because not many things have

1813
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,700
the kind of well-defined repeatability that you need to make unit,

1814
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,600
testing successful, but sometimes you do.

1815
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,700
And so for like the renderer, for example, where you that would

1816
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,600
probably be a place where we do unit tests.

1817
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,400
We will have some performance test which look a lot like unit tests.

1818
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,000
They're not really testing correctness as much as they're testing

1819
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:38,700
speed.

1820
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,500
So we'll have some of that.

1821
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,300
So you will see a little bit of that.

1822
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,300
You just don't see as much of it as you could.

1823
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:47,300
In other disciplines where the state space is much simpler games, have

1824
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,400
huge State spaces that are that are very different from the kinds of

1825
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,500
code, that is usefully tested by unit tests.

1826
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,800
And so usually, if you were doing unit tests on a game, you're often

1827
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,700
testing things that don't really that aren't really the hard part.

1828
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,000
So,

1829
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,500
You'd like your bulletproofing, your easy cases by writing unit tests

1830
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,600
in most game code, and that doesn't really help you.

1831
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,700
But there are places where you can use it and we will use it.

1832
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,300
I suspect on the stream in a couple places.

1833
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,500
We just haven't gotten anything.

1834
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:17,500
We're still doing exploratory work on how we want the engine designed.

1835
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,100
And so until we get to some code that we think we're going to ship.

1836
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,900
There's really not much that much point in doing it test, right?

1837
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,200
Because you just kind of wasting your time.

1838
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,100
You're wasting your time, bulletproofing something that you're not

1839
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:27,800
playing ship.

1840
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,600
Does this form of live coding work with adding member variables to

1841
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,300
structs in some cases?

1842
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,100
Yes, in some cases.

1843
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,700
No, like I said, there's the harder data data layout stuff is

1844
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,700
something we didn't to do because it was going to be a very much more

1845
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,000
involved process to do that.

1846
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,700
It involves writing meta code and stuff.

1847
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,600
And so, I didn't want to do that, but you can add to, like the end of

1848
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,900
structs in certain situations, but you

1849
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,400
Rearrange data members.

1850
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:06,000
And the reason for that is because, well, I mean, you could, as long

1851
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,500
as there weren't any of them in use yet, right, but assuming that

1852
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,700
there are ones in use, they won't get remapped.

1853
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,100
And so, what you need to do is you need to go in and remap all of the

1854
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,400
ones that were different now.

1855
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,000
And we.

1856
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,900
Yeah, so we didn't Implement that.

1857
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,700
How does this test code help at the future architecture?

1858
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:27,900
Since it all gets dumped?

1859
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:32,800
So basically what it does is it will Define exactly what we want our

1860
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:33,700
engine to do.

1861
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,600
I always say right?

1862
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,700
The usage code first and I really, really, really mean that never

1863
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,000
write an engine without knowing exactly how the game is going to use

1864
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,700
that engine.

1865
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,200
And that is what we're doing right now.

1866
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,800
So we're basically just building a game, doing whatever it is that we

1867
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,900
want to do first.

1868
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:52,500
And then what we'll do is we'll just kind of pull out those pieces and

1869
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,100
turn them into real.

1870
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,700
Hidden components, as we go and we already did a little bit of that

1871
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:58,500
with our tile map.

1872
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,900
We have it done a whole lot.

1873
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,300
But we've already made the tile map stuff, work.

1874
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,400
Kind of that way, where we've defined what it needed to do, and we

1875
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,100
just haven't, we haven't gone and done like full hardcore engine stuff

1876
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,100
on it yet, but we did pull it out into a little system.

1877
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:11,900
And so, that's the way things will work.

1878
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,100
So don't think of it as dumping think of it as continually evolving,

1879
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,600
but the point that I'm trying to make before, was that none of the

1880
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,300
code that we wrote as written, will be what ships in the game.

1881
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,100
So you don't really have to

1882
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,400
Worried about it at that level.

1883
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:27,600
You just have to look at it and go.

1884
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,200
Okay.

1885
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,600
What does this do right now?

1886
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,100
And why do we want it to do that?

1887
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:34,000
And what is, what do we need the engine to eventually do for us in

1888
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,600
that case?

1889
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,100
So, the question of the person asked about sorting is actually totally

1890
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,500
fine to ask a little further down the road when we're trying to figure

1891
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:44,000
out how we want to do things attached to guys so that they start right

1892
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,000
and all those sorts of things.

1893
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,800
But you know, that's not really where we're at at this at this point.

1894
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,900
We're not really trying to solve those kind of problems right now.

1895
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,400
Once we get to them we'll think about how we want them solved.

1896
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:53,300
Will spec that for the engine.

1897
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,100
Push it aside.

1898
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:55,000
And off we go.

1899
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,100
I'm not sure if this is true.

1900
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:12,100
I'm assuming you are making the guy clip when leaving the screen but

1901
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,500
why make it clip?

1902
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:17,900
If you can just make it Follow the yellow box, which might clip the

1903
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,700
guy itself again.

1904
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,500
I really sorry.

1905
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,000
I'm not sure.

1906
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,400
I understand the question.

1907
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:27,300
Yeah, I apologize.

1908
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:27,700
I'm not sure.

1909
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,900
I understand the question so I can't really add much to that.

1910
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,200
If streaming assets will be required to display, all visual

1911
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,800
information.

1912
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,100
Will there be some type of manual limit placed on the procedural

1913
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,800
generation to ensure that all assets will never be required for a

1914
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,600
single room.

1915
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,500
Well, that's kind of getting ahead again of where we are.

1916
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,900
But the simple answer to that is it depends on what our asset plan is.

1917
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,300
It depends whether our assets have a degradation path or not.

1918
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,300
And of questions, right?

1919
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,400
At the end of questions, how is that possible?

1920
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,300
That is just too, that is a good omen people.

1921
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:14,600
Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining me for

1922
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,400
another episode of handmade hero.

1923
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,600
This was a pretty fun one.

1924
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,900
I'm kind of glad we have a little dude moving around.

1925
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,500
Now, that's a little bit satisfying and it makes me want him to have a

1926
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,300
nice sort of feel as he moves and a nice animation as he moves around.

1927
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,800
And so I feel like that kind of

1928
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,100
Answers, my question of what we should do next.

1929
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,500
I think I definitely do want to go ahead and say let's animate the guy

1930
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,900
next and make them have kind of a nice feel as you move them around

1931
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:45,600
because that will basically let me start talking about the math and

1932
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,800
let us get into some kind of really interesting stuff.

1933
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,900
Yeah, I think that's, that's, that's what we want to do.

1934
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,800
So, I think tomorrow what we'll do is we'll end off.

1935
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,400
Well, I'll have I'll take a look at my sheet of stuff that we've

1936
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,200
postponed.

1937
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,900
Tomorrow will basically be our

1938
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:00,600
Clean up day.

1939
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,600
We'll just go through everything anything that we want done before

1940
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,500
then, and then let's let's just go ahead and say unless there's some

1941
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,700
major turnaround over the weekend or something.

1942
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,100
Let's just go ahead and say that Monday is going to be our day to

1943
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:16,200
start some serious math action because that's going to power us up a

1944
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,400
lot and we're going to need that power for all the stuff that we're

1945
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,100
going to want to do.

1946
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:27,200
So, please consider joining us for that for that episode Monday.

1947
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:27,900
8:00 p.m.

1948
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:28,800
PST.

1949
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,800
We will be back here.

1950
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:34,100
But if you would like to catch us tomorrow, tomorrow is the stream for

1951
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,700
our friends in Europe, obviously, on Fridays.

1952
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,300
We always.

1953
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,600
Go ahead and do a stream earlier in the morning.

1954
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,400
So that people on the time zones, can catch those set of 8, p.m.

1955
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,300
Tomorrow's will be 9 a.m.

1956
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,200
Pacific Standard time in the morning.

1957
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:51,900
So if you are interested in catching sort of the, the final, the final

1958
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,000
step in our, in our current series of handmade hero stuff before we

1959
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,300
start the math, please join us tomorrow at 9 a.m.

1960
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,800
Pacific Standard Time.

1961
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:00,900
It's a little bit early.

1962
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,100
I will be groggy, so will everyone else?

1963
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,000
But we'll get through it with a little bit of coffee.

1964
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:05,600
Almond milk.

1965
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,500
I suspect and I would love to see you there.

1966
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,600
Again, if you are interested in following along at home and you have

1967
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,800
not done, so you can always pre-order the game and that comes with the

1968
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,400
full source code.

1969
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,800
So you can always download every night after we finish programming.

1970
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,300
You can always download the latest source code and follow along at

1971
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:22,600
home.

1972
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,700
It also comes with the test assets that were using here.

1973
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:28,400
So you can, you know, use those as well and see you can you can kind

1974
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:29,300
of play around with them?

1975
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,400
Just like we're doing.

1976
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:32,500
Similarly.

1977
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,700
If you want to support the video series.

1978
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,700
We have a patreon.

1979
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,200
We also have a news or patreon.

1980
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,400
I don't actually know you pronounce that I suppose patreon.

1981
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,100
I'm not sure.

1982
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,800
But you can subscribe to that if you want support the video series and

1983
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,500
we have a news and Forum site.

1984
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,700
You can go to which has a lot of great information on it.

1985
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,100
It's got the schedule for the week posted.

1986
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,000
It's got an episode guide with all the previous episodes and people

1987
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,100
submit time-coded, sort of jump lists, and you can jump around in

1988
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,200
them, which is kind of Handy.

1989
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,800
There's a coding resources section, which has Port still there.

1990
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,300
Forms are trying to follow along a Linux or Mac has some great

1991
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,400
resources for you there.

1992
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,800
And of course, there is a code discussion forum.

1993
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,600
If you want to ask questions, so please check it out.

1994
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,700
If you're trying to learn from the stream, that's a great place to go.

1995
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,800
A lot of really helpful, people up there, and people have done some

1996
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:13,500
really great stuff.

1997
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,700
So, I highly recommend it.

1998
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:15,300
All right.

1999
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:19,200
Thank you, everyone for joining me and I hope to see you tomorrow and

2000
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,400
Monday as well.

2001
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,200
So, take it easy, everyone.
