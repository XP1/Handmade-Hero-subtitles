1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,000
So it's about time to get started again.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,300
So one of the things that people who watch the series on Twitch know

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,200
that oftentimes in the twitch chat or even on the stream data oriented

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
programming or other.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,800
Other terms like this, come up and pretty much universally, what

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,200
everyone mentions and what I mention on the stream is go watch, the

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,900
CPP con keynote by Mike, actin, go check it out.

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,600
Like it's a fantastic lecture.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,700
And it's like, it's just the perfect thing to point people to, as an

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,700
introduction to sort of the same sorts of stuff that we always talk

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,100
about and given by somebody, with, with a lot of credibility industry

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
as well as is pretty great.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,600
And so when I was putting together who I wanted to come talk to you

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:46,800
today.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,700
I was like well I don't I don't know.

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,000
Mike actin and never met him but I was like I just can send him an

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,500
email and see if he wants to come because I know that everyone would

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,200
love to hear what he had to say and and he was able to make it.

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,000
So thank you very much for coming and we're going to

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Talk to him.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,900
I guess he was making notes during Tommy's talk, so he actually has

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
some stuff that he wants to talk about separate from my list.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
So, so this should be pretty good.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,300
So, please join me welcoming Mike actin.

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
So Mike, I do have to say, this is an entirely different reaction that

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,900
I got from the C++ program.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:29,800
What?

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,600
You do, we're gonna so before, you know, will we, I'm interested to

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,400
know what's on the list.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,300
But before I ask about that, I just wanted to say quickly for people

31
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,800
who don't know very much, like for people who aren't in the game

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,100
industry.

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,900
For example, obviously, you do the technical Direction at Insomniac,

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
tell them just a little bit about what that actually is because

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
there's probably people have never worked at a game company before

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,600
those people would not even know what that necessarily means.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,800
So okay so we have an engine team and you know,

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The in the AAA space, I'd say we're about, we're at the low end of

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,800
size and the AAA space.

40
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,800
So our engine teams about 20 people and people and that includes the

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,200
our engine support people, which we have two people who are not

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,300
programmers on the team.

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,600
Okay, Steve Lee doing testing and other organization stuff, okay?

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,600
And so yeah it's a engine team and we do not just the engine run time

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:29,800
at all.

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,400
So the tools and supporting all the current games that were working

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
on, which tends to be somewhere between three and six Active games in

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,000
the studio.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,100
That's a lot for 22 people.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Sure.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,100
I mean so so yeah, I mean, we do all that engine in tools support and

52
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Chase around the studio.

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,600
I mean, in the rest of production, which is another roughly 190

54
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,000
people.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,800
Yeah, are divided into their various Productions and shared, you know,

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
groups and things.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
And so yeah, we're

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,100
Running around supporting all the, all the games in development and

59
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,900
working on the engine and active forward features and whatever.

60
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,400
You know, the current fire and problem is and whatever.

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,700
The current demo is and whatever.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,500
The current thing that publisher wants and that we want you not to

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,700
show off in terms of our vision of the game and Tech.

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,200
So yeah, it's a lot of stuff and I think you know there's that you

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
know we are like I said, sort of the small end

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,300
Dove AAA but you know, that means that it's very rapidly.

67
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Yeah, from really have to be moving fast and there's no room for slaw

68
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
at our scale, right?

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,900
When you have a bunch of games in development and a team, you know, of

70
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,300
the size and you have to support everybody and you stuff to make

71
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
forward progress on an engine.

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,400
And you have to make all the details and everything.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,800
Everybody is moving all the time and so what's your role in that?

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,600
So my role is the director of the team which is, you know, largely to

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:03:59,800
work.

76
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,300
You know, work with the team and work with the leads on the team and

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,000
organizing and make sure that we, you know, it's well, I like to tell

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,700
the team that your job is what you make it and I think that's true of

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,800
just about anybody, right?

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,500
You find you figure out what your your best way to contribute is.

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,899
And for me, you know, as the Director that's really sort of sitting

82
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,800
down with everybody sometimes, it's Architectural Review and saying

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
you know what, it is that you are doing and how do we approach it?

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And is there a better way or is there?

85
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,800
You know, can I just ask the right questions to

86
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,300
Sort of cut off this you know a path that's going to waste a bunch of

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,600
time.

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,100
Okay.

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Or is it sort of low level review?

90
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm just looking at some code and doing that, or is it I, you know,

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,800
it's actually valuable for me to sit down and write something here,

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,300
right?

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,800
Okay, so sometimes you'll actually jump in and do something if that's

94
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,300
like really critical at that point.

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,200
Yeah, I mean it happens sometimes.

96
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,900
You know, usually though the that's not the highest value thing I can

97
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,200
be doing, right?

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,900
I, you know, I want my job as much as possible to be X.

99
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,500
You know what everybody is doing?

100
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,300
So as much as possible.

101
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,700
I need to be making everybody else better and spending time figuring

102
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,700
out how to help them become better programmers and that's really where

103
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,500
or better leads or whatever it is, right?

104
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,700
And that's really where the value comes in for what I do.

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,100
So, like, you know, obviously, I think, most people are probably seen

106
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,400
this EP pecan lecture, and the sort of stuff you talked about about

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
focusing on, you know what the actual problem is and the data and

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,700
transformation in the hardware, all of these things.

109
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Do you find that, you know, at your scale which is, you know, 2020 or

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,400
so programmers who are working on, you know, engine console engine

111
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,700
stuff you've get a lot of our, most of the people on that team of the

112
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,900
same opinion as you about those things or is, is that, like, is there

113
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,700
some degree of tension about among people that, like, a lot of people

114
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,100
want a lot of object-oriented stuff is starting to look like, how does

115
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,700
that?

116
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,800
How does that look on your team?

117
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,500
Because I don't really know.

118
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,400
Because you're essentially a person with a very specific opinion about

119
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,900
that.

120
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,800
And what is the rest of the

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Look like I would say, well, I mean to be fair most you would be

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,100
everybody.

123
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Looks moderate by comparison to me.

124
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,600
Okay?

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,300
Okay, so that's true as well.

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,500
I think on on our engine team, right?

127
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
And the further away a think you get from from the engine team, the

128
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,800
more, that's true, okay?

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Now, when you get to the sort of the gameplay team, they're going to

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,500
be less in that spot.

131
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,900
Okay.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,800
But I think even among I think even among the the engine

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,900
Even though I mean I think we're all you know about the same kind of

134
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,200
fundamental principles, right?

135
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,300
We're all about understanding what it is that we're doing and and it's

136
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,200
really the small things that are different and it's about, you know,

137
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,000
it's how much we compromise that it's okay difference.

138
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,200
So there's no fundamental argue, there's certainly no one, no one on

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,000
the team that's saying.

140
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,400
You know what?

141
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,200
We really need here is more abstraction.

142
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,600
Okay?

143
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,800
What we really need here is to spend some time making uml diagram,

144
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,100
okay?

145
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,800
Okay, is no one, that is not said that that painting.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,600
All right, so yeah, it's a matter of scale, right?

147
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,200
It's a matter of, you know, I you know how much is too much and you

148
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,100
know how much is it you know, where they wear something else really

149
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,700
more valuable to spend time on so I think maybe as a team we look

150
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,000
Extreme as a whole compared to other teams so your extreme in an

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,900
extreme team.

152
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,700
So in some sense yeah it's just some degree but I think yeah I mean I

153
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,500
think everybody is, you know, really wants to understand what you

154
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,800
know, not just their database.

155
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,700
What it is that they're doing and and fundamentally solve be rational

156
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
about how they solve problems.

157
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,800
So, within that space, if you're working with smart people who want to

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,700
be rational, it's hard to go wrong.

159
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,400
Okay really.

160
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,500
So, so like one of the questions I wanted to ask because it's

161
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,800
something that I get asked a lot of time and I'm not really in a

162
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,500
position to answer on the show is a lot of people worried or have the

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,200
understanding that a lot of the things that have to do with maybe like

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,800
object-oriented.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,500
I mean, or other the kinds of programming that you were explicitly

166
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
saying aren't very helpful.

167
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,200
Like, in the CPP, con thing, that those are necessary for larger

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,400
scale.

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,700
Look they have this opinion that.

170
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah.

171
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,500
Okay.

172
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,600
If they start to believe that focused problem-solving kinds of

173
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,300
programming works for one person, they don't believe it would work for

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,300
20 people and somehow the like object-oriented this is necessary or it

175
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,800
comes as part of this attempt to make the programming scale.

176
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,000
Up to larger teams.

177
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,000
And so, as someone who is actually, you know, in charge of making sure

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,100
that such a team runs smoothly, would you say that's accurate

179
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,799
inaccurate?

180
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,600
Would, you know, what are your thoughts on that?

181
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,900
Kind of a comment or question, right?

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,300
So, here's the problem with the question, perfect, which is that, you

183
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,000
can't defend the question, okay?

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,200
Right.

185
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,400
You're giving me secondhand question, certainly.

186
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, right?

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
So, you know what?

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,600
I would be asking the whoever was asking the question was, you know,

189
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,300
from where do you get this?

190
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,400
Joint.

191
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,900
Right?

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,700
You know it because somebody told you yeah.

193
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,700
Is it because this is your actual experience that, you know, you've

194
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
been working in the space for this long.

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,400
But, you know, I mean, basically, the answer is no, that's complete

196
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,000
bullshit.

197
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,100
It's, it makes no sense like, that's why you would want to get to the

198
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,700
heart of the question.

199
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,200
Because the question doesn't make any sense.

200
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Okay, there's no evidence to support none zero evidence to support

201
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,700
that.

202
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
In fact, I think, you know, if you looked at, we look if we just did a

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Search.

204
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,200
So the most successful you know, you know the libraries for instance

205
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,700
that a survive, the longest have been the most successful.

206
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,300
You probably wouldn't find a deep object hierarchy in them, okay?

207
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,600
You would find sort of simple you know interfaces?

208
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
You know you might they might have their own problems.

209
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,100
But you know this you know the simple, you know, input output

210
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,200
interfaces are going to certainly last the test of time and be

211
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,500
complicated and support.

212
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,800
I mean, how many how many projects have used say

213
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Lib C or leave em.

214
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:01,900
Right?

215
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,500
Right.

216
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,100
You know, that that's a large fairly large-scale, right?

217
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,500
And then lots of projects have used them and, you know, and to be

218
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,300
honest, I think that the real, the real answer to that is, it's

219
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,800
actually counterproductive.

220
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Okay.

221
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,700
So scaling to a large project, you know, if we look at Deep object

222
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
hierarchies and that kind of design, you know, I'm gonna sort of

223
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,700
imagining in my head, what that design looks like what happens is

224
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,800
you're hiding.

225
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,500
So much valuable information and you're creating so much not valuable

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,400
if we serve adding.

227
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah, problem, right?

228
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,200
That you're making the problem more complicated than it is.

229
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,900
And when you have a bunch of people, 100 people, you know, a thousand

230
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,100
people all making the problem more complicated than actually is, its

231
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,600
orders of magnitude.

232
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Ultimately of just bullshit that you have to get through to get to the

233
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
what you actually need to do.

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:53,900
Yes.

235
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,200
A more bullshit, right?

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,800
And that I think is problematic like it.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,300
Actually going to be more brittle and harder to understand and more

238
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,400
difficult to change and more difficult to test and pretty much any

239
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
measure that you would want.

240
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,400
It's going to be it's going to be poor performing then the equivalent,

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
you know, and you don't even know that it's equivalent sort of data

242
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,700
oriented model, which is the equivalent simpler model, right?

243
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,300
Just reduce the level of abstraction as much as you could have.

244
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,100
Instead of thinking that you were adding some benefit by making things

245
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
more removed, right.

246
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,800
I think

247
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,500
Adding, I mean, this is the thing that I disagree with a lot of people

248
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,800
on is that adding stuff to the problem.

249
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,400
Does not make the problem simpler.

250
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,000
It never makes the problem.

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Simpler do adding something.

252
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
Always makes it more complicated.

253
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,700
So you want to find the absolute minimum amount that describes, the

254
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
solution that you're dealing with, or even the problem, right?

255
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,400
This is the minimum set.

256
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,800
This is the minimum thing and that's what your, what Your solution is,

257
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,000
right?

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's what you're dealing with.

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,800
As soon as you start adding even just adding small,

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
Those that are in your head like I'm thinking of the problem in this

261
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,100
way, that's something that you're not adding to the problem space and

262
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,200
now somebody else is going to come and read it and that they have to

263
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
reinterpret this model that you had in your head on top of what the

264
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,500
actual problem is.

265
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,300
And that's going to cause confusion and it's going to, you know, and

266
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,900
this is why, you know, this is why they say one of the difficult

267
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,600
problems in programming is naming because by naming something, you are

268
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,100
introducing preconceived notion.

269
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,900
Yeah, you're introducing

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
In problem space, so you're introducing your mental mental model to

271
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,900
the space that just doesn't exist there.

272
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,800
To that point, I did have one of my notes from go right ahead and

273
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Tommy's talk where he Tommy.

274
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,200
Yeah.

275
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,700
Sorry.

276
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,200
I you were first sorry.

277
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,500
So you're just gonna have to live with it.

278
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,300
You said that, you know, you had you're talking about the physics

279
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,800
stuff that you're doing are the controls.

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
So your tummy what controls and you're saying, you know, you have this

281
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,100
sort of garbage formula, this is what your word right garbage from the

282
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,900
garbage data and that they didn't make any physical sense, right?

283
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
That was also your foot.

284
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,700
So here's the problem I have with that language of that is that I

285
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,700
think that you know the the preconceived idea that the physical model

286
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,900
that take trying to apply sort of a real world models of this that if

287
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,500
that's better, is a problem.

288
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,100
That's not it's not better.

289
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,200
In fact, you've demonstrated through your game that that's not better.

290
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,900
Write that you've picked a model that is better for your game based on

291
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,200
You're testing based on it, three months of hard work based on, you

292
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,900
know, the having a very clear input and output, right?

293
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,500
The input is the can this you know the controls, right?

294
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,700
The, your physical input, the output is Tommy Smiles, right?

295
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,300
That's it, is very clear, right?

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,300
And the answer to that is the the stuff that you came up with right is

297
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,600
that that it's not garbage, it is the right answer, it works, right?

298
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,800
It's

299
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,400
It's the appropriate response the way you did it.

300
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,300
Sort of testing it and iterating on it, and, and it doesn't matter

301
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,100
that there's not an eight, you know, you had to create a name for, you

302
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,500
know, twisting, physical, whatever in the air, you know, doesn't it?

303
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,800
But it doesn't matter that it's not real, right?

304
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,400
It doesn't matter, that doesn't fit the model.

305
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,800
I think you probably lost time by thinking, that it should have fit

306
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,600
the model and I think coming back and now even reflecting on it and

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,400
still using the word save garbage when you're when you're referring

308
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
to, it sets the wrong message.

309
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,900
So there is in fact, the

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,400
Opposite.

311
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
It's exactly the right thing.

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Garbage would have been trying to make it real, right?

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,700
Because it wouldn't have been fun that kind of gets a sort of a, I

314
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,100
suppose an interesting mentality there.

315
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,800
That's true for a lot of stuff which is just there's a notion of

316
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,600
There is some like, you know, proper programming Elegance, something

317
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,300
blah, blah, blah.

318
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,100
And then if you're not doing that, you kind of have to couch your

319
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,400
statement about what you did.

320
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Like if you're not using a real physics, engine simulating, all of

321
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,300
this stuff, or whatever you have to call it garbage formula.

322
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,400
So that people don't say, oh, you don't know how to program.

323
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,000
You're just doing these like hockey formula, something, but kind of

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
sounds like what you're saying is like, no, no.

325
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,400
Like the problem is to make this thing.

326
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,300
Do what it's supposed to do and whatever is the correct solution to

327
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,100
that is is the best programming.

328
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,900
You could have done basically.

329
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,600
Luckily, yes.

330
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,800
If it's the it's the it's a simple solution that solves.

331
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Exactly.

332
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,100
The problem that I had.

333
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
Yeah, that's the right answer.

334
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,600
Anything else is fucked up.

335
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,800
Like, why would I do anything else?

336
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,400
And so, yeah, there's that whole idea that there's that you can take.

337
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,900
There's a solution in The Ether without context without understanding

338
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,200
the problem that must be the right solution to this problem is such

339
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,400
complete nonsense.

340
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,800
Like there is no other, like there's no other space.

341
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,200
I can think of, that's like that.

342
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
That's just complete and utter nonsense.

343
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,300
I so why we think that there's there's that's even a thing is

344
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,700
unfathomable to me.

345
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,400
But it is and we know it is and people do.

346
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll bring that kind of stuff all the time.

347
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay, so did you wanted so, I don't know what's on the, see, kind of

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,200
some kind of, like, leaning over my list here.

349
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,600
Let me just tell you some of the, let's see what's on your list first?

350
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Because if you had something you wanted to talk about, I should not.

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
I should I should not interrupt.

352
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,800
So hey, you

353
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,400
You tell me okay, my list is totally random, just stuff that you're

354
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,800
talking Tommy just sort of like a girls night.

355
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,400
I just what I need to do is get you and Tommy up here to talk and then

356
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,200
and then I can go, you know, the lunch.

357
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,500
So you mentioned that you could lock down controls early, which sort

358
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
of lock down the level design now, you're design the levels around it

359
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,900
and I think this is a really super important takeaway for everybody.

360
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,200
This is not a lesson to ignore another nice, or I'll bring an

361
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,600
alternate.

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,099
Another example of a similar kind of thing, which is you to working on

363
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:09,300
a say, an open world game, which is much more common nowadays, right?

364
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,599
And we work on Sunset and Sons of seven World game.

365
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,400
And one of the things that people many people don't realize that a

366
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,500
sort of a fundamental function.

367
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Everything is a fundamental function of like this.

368
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,800
One piece of information is critical to design everything in the game

369
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,900
and that's movement speed especially in an open world game.

370
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Because when you know, when we're talking about an open world game,

371
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
we're talking about physics.

372
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,000
I mean real world physics.

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Like we're streaming off of a disc.

374
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,000
Ultimately it's not.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Everything is not a memory.

376
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,400
It's got to come from disk.

377
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,000
And that disk has real speed.

378
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,300
Yes, actually moving around right now, is it?

379
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
So we say real-world physics, you don't mean simulated physics.

380
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,500
You mean the actual physics is of the world?

381
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,500
Spinning the Des?

382
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes.

383
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Okay.

384
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,900
So there's physical re, you know, and everything will ultimately comes

385
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,600
down to physics, right?

386
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,700
I mean, there's ultimately this the reason why memory is the way it is

387
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,800
and yet speed, but

388
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,700
This is a more human relatable, physical problem, like there's a

389
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,500
spinning thing.

390
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,300
And so you know, getting the data off that Des is a real issue, right?

391
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,500
And even Under The best scenario, the best circumstances where like

392
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,200
the best circumstance is really, it's a, a console space where, you

393
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,400
know, the console manufacturers, just bought the shittiest Hardware.

394
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Okay, I'm kind of right, but at least it's at least, you know, that

395
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,800
right there is a baseline that you can work with unlike the PC.

396
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,400
See where there's probably an whole bottom whole Barrel that they

397
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,900
missed.

398
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,400
That's blow that but somebody who buying PC can find, right?

399
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,900
So you know as so you have to work with that, right?

400
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,700
You have to know that this is, you know, this is basically the

401
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,900
expected seek speed that you can potentially get off this drive and

402
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,600
this is the absolute, you know what, you could, what you could

403
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,900
statistically guess you can get off of these you know these drives in

404
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
terms of bandwidth.

405
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,700
So those are sort of Baseline information that you absolutely have to

406
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,800
have to make any decisions.

407
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,500
All and then you have movement speed, right?

408
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,100
So you're moving around and that's determining sort of what you're

409
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,500
loading in.

410
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,000
We just determining how it, how fast can you get from here to here is,

411
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
how much time I have to stream in whatever?

412
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
Is there right?

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,800
Yeah, so which will ultimately determine your budgets right?

414
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,900
If I'm moving faster, my budgets, get smaller because I can only, I

415
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,000
can very good flesh intrigued, you know, assuming you have your world

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,200
divided up in some kind of tile, right?

417
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
And so

418
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,500
You know, you say your movement speed to say it's like 50 meters a

419
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:33,800
second.

420
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,300
That's a completely different game than if it's a 10 meters is because

421
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,200
now your worlds, you know, you're sort of tile, budget is

422
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,900
significantly different between those two things, right?

423
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,600
Radically different how you design the world, how much you can load

424
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,200
and you know, all that is just as radical differences between those

425
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,700
two choices based on this one variable, that's pretty interesting too.

426
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,200
Because that sort of is especially if you're talking about a large

427
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
team that basically affects

428
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,300
Almost everybody who's working.

429
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,500
Yes, the artists have to know this because they need to know how

430
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,600
detailed to make their stuff.

431
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,000
What it will look like, you know, how you know, especially if there's

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,400
lotting that happens or something like this, you know, what can I

433
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,500
really expect to have seen?

434
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,700
It affects the programming team because they have to think about like

435
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,300
it, what are we?

436
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,200
You know, how are we going to design this for balancing thing and

437
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,400
everything?

438
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
So that that really that one number, I guess, could could pretty much

439
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,600
change.

440
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Literally everyone's job in the company, depending on where you said

441
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,100
it.

442
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,700
Sure.

443
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,000
So let's say you started.

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,900
I mean, we can go one of two ways is how you started out slow, right?

445
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,500
Say we're just making up numbers here.

446
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,800
The thing started at 10 meters.

447
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Second and you're going through, you do a year of development and all

448
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,400
of a sudden boom through iteration.

449
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Everything programmers just know what you know what 50 meters seconds,

450
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,600
that's fun.

451
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,100
Okay.

452
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,100
Okay, so now you have to go back and basically toss all the love of

453
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,500
work that you've done redo everything and a year.

454
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,000
And if you have 50 people or 100, people are 200 people.

455
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Or if you soft, you have like five thousand people all working on that

456
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
one levels, right?

457
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700
You're potentially, you know, you're potentially throwing the millions

458
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,400
and millions of dollars.

459
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,800
Yeah, right to say start over.

460
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,700
And maybe that's worth it.

461
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah.

462
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,000
Probably.

463
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,400
It's not, you know, and, and that's just because, you know, if you're

464
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,700
moving that much faster, your budgets have to be that much smaller.

465
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,600
Right, right?

466
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Or if it's the other way, right?

467
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,200
Let's take it.

468
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,500
The other way.

469
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,400
You started off 50 and you go your development.

470
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,700
You say, you know what, really we're not getting much punch out of

471
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:17,900
that.

472
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,100
We can slow this way down.

473
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Yeah.

474
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,100
And we can we can comfortably just like maybe you have more detailed

475
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,000
environments but same time now you have the opposite problem right?

476
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
You've done all this work and hasn't taken advantage of now this extra

477
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,800
buffer

478
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,200
Right?

479
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,100
And it's not a game.

480
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,100
May look kind of lousy by comparison to somebody because you could

481
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,700
have put all this detail in there and instead it's very spare because

482
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,800
it had to fit some streaming budget for like, basically a racing game

483
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,600
at this point, whereas you're a walk around looking for this game.

484
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,900
So the I mean, the lesson isn't really about locking knob controls or

485
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,100
about the movement speed.

486
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,800
It's about if, you know, figuring out what these sort of Keystone

487
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,900
variables are in your game or in whatever, you know the problem space

488
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,900
that you're dealing with is

489
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,300
Because you know, if you ignore them if you don't understand what they

490
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
are and they're always there and if you don't know what these key

491
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,800
stones are, what's going to happen is, you're just going fuck yourself

492
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,300
to, okay?

493
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,000
Because if you didn't pay attention to that, right?

494
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,100
You're just going to assume that I can just load the level, you're

495
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,500
just going to assume that it's going to work out.

496
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,900
And then you're going to say well I can just optimized at the end

497
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,100
which is the word you know anytime I hear that you want to slap

498
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:23,600
somebody.

499
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,500
You know you're going to get to the end.

500
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,800
You want to slap that person or just is there just like a person?

501
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,200
You have who's paid to be like slapped?

502
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,000
My I think this is just, there is a chain of people, okay?

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,900
So by the time it gets to that when you know, that one person saying,

504
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,900
there must have been a change that needs to Slap.

505
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,500
Ya, big long, slap, wake up, like a running slap.

506
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,300
Yeah, I'm just imagining that right now.

507
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,300
So yeah, I mean understanding what this Keystone variables are is

508
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,900
critical to doing your job properly.

509
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,500
Otherwise, you're just going to end up with sort of garbage and you

510
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
may or may not be able to make it make it work and ship it.

511
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
But it's either going to be really poor or it's not going to take

512
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,000
advantage of what you know what it could have had and if it's not

513
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
taking advantage of it then you know it's doing a disservice to your

514
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,400
players ultimately and

515
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
It's, you know, that's unprofessional.

516
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,600
So is that something that you sort of do organically I guess or is

517
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,200
that something that's actually more a little more.

518
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
I don't want a formal but like do you actually sit down when like

519
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,700
you're working on a project at the early end and you know, come back

520
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,200
to the design team and go look these you know, looking at the way,

521
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,100
we're this, you know, we're sort of talking about this game.

522
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
These are the very critical factors that you guys need to nail down

523
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,100
like now because you can't beat, you know, changing this or that or is

524
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,400
it not like, you know, how does that actually play out for you?

525
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
You when you're actually doing something like Sunset Overdrive.

526
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's say so.

527
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,600
Yes, I think there are some, you know, when we can identify them and

528
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,500
is, you know, basically as soon as we can identify them, and we say

529
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,700
this or there is a massive knock-on effect.

530
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Making this decision then,

531
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
We absolutely bring that to everybody.

532
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Who will listen.

533
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Okay, everybody has to just shut me up about it.

534
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,700
Okay.

535
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,200
Because yes, this is absolutely critical in must be decided or you

536
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
have to understand the cost of changing your mother.

537
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,800
What's going to happen, which is sometimes happens, sometimes they

538
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,000
say, I understand the cost of changing my mind.

539
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,300
Except that cost but I still don't know the answer.

540
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
So we have to move forward.

541
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,100
Okay.

542
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
Okay, fine.

543
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,600
That's just the way it is, okay, but yeah, I mean, absolutely you want

544
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,000
to identify those and make it make it loud as possible and you know

545
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,300
what people sometimes, you know, people don't want to hear it.

546
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,200
People don't want to hear that.

547
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,100
Sure that I have to, I have to make this decision now and you just

548
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,800
have to do it anyway.

549
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Sorry doesn't matter if you don't want to do it just weird, you know.

550
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
So so yeah.

551
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,700
Yes, that's the answer.

552
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,200
Makes perfect sense, was there.

553
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,100
Another thing on the list?

554
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,500
I know.

555
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,600
I have more things in the list.

556
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,100
You okay.

557
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,000
Well, so I have, I think I can fit the thing I was going to ask, we've

558
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
got to let see 1250 as an hour.

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
So we've got it got plenty of time left.

560
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,600
So I want to do a couple more on there because the other things I have

561
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,100
to ask I think will fit relatively easily have to ask.

562
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,400
I have to there's a couple things I'm like I gotta ask them.

563
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,000
All right, I got a so exporting, cinematics.

564
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,500
Right.

565
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,400
So Tommy mention exporting cinematix as a problem on Super Meat Boy

566
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,900
Inside time-consuming iteration thing, right?

567
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,500
So I would like to share the exporting cinematix as a problem.

568
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Does not go away should any scale.

569
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:48,000
And in fact, I mean Ron, who is I guess the inventor of the Cinematic

570
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,300
for the most part

571
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,200
We could probably attest to this being true from the very beginning.

572
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,300
So you can ask him that I wrote was true, I'll add in very beginning.

573
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,900
So, you know, we were looking at sort of cinematics, in Sunset

574
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,500
Overdrive and all of our cinematics are real time.

575
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,700
So you'd expect that that would, in fact not be a problem but real

576
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,300
time or not.

577
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,400
There's the, you know, there is a large animation and a lot of

578
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,100
Hand done work and that the enemy is doing in in Maya and our days.

579
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,900
And when you're saying cut scene here, in this case, nowadays is it's

580
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,100
in engine, kind of attendant and it's all real time.

581
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,200
It's all real time.

582
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
So it's not pre-rendered but it is actually designed right?

583
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,300
And the campus here and this.

584
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah yeah, yeah.

585
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,700
I mean it's somebody by like we have a cinematix tool that lets them

586
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,300
lay out tracks and do all the things instead of per frame.

587
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,000
And you know as you have seen you have music track that everything has

588
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
to be synchronized to the music track.

589
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,900
In some cases and all you have like the the first, the opening

590
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,200
cinematic and Sunset Overdrive had 90 shots, okay?

591
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,800
So it's a very just very complicated

592
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,700
Yeah, cinematic, right?

593
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,700
And you have to still deal with all the the fact that it's the game

594
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,000
and it's all the real-time things and still have to deal with, you

595
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
know, texture streaming, and all the things that happen and 90 shots,

596
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:10,900
you know?

597
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,800
Because yeah, that's a lot of shots.

598
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,100
So, it's a time-consuming process to build, but it's also a time

599
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,700
consuming process to export which we have which was not a real limit.

600
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,600
We're not a real problem.

601
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,100
Until we got cinematics of the scope and when you realize this is when

602
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,800
you really see the limits of the the

603
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,500
The work that you're doing, we use colada as our export format.

604
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,900
Okay?

605
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,500
And you know you can say what you want about colada which is you know

606
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,700
you can you can start with saying it's not a great format.

607
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,800
Yeah I totally agree with you.

608
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,000
Is it like compressed?

609
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,300
Text compressed would be a stretch.

610
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,100
So is it like it's been like to text?

611
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,100
It is text.

612
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,400
Okay?

613
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,100
It's XML.

614
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
All right, all right.

615
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,700
It's yeah, that's about.

616
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,500
Don't we don't really have to get into.

617
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,700
Okay, fair enough, keep going.

618
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,000
You know, the point of the point of colada is it's an interchange

619
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,700
format, right?

620
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,700
It is supposed to be an interchange format of which, at the point, at

621
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
which it was designed, there wasn't very many.

622
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,900
There was no successful interchange format, other than obj, which is

623
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,700
not sufficient.

624
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,800
And you know, since then, since then, we now have unofficially anyway

625
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,300
fbx, right in that.

626
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,700
Yes, from one more compatible with more stuff, mostly because Autodesk

627
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:29,800
own

628
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,600
Is everybody, right?

629
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,300
Once you own everybody, you can just say we're not straight this file

630
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,700
format.

631
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,300
Yeah, so that's largely.

632
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,000
The reason why if PX is successful.

633
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,300
So anyway, we use colada and, you know, it turns out at least using

634
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,300
the export of that we had at the time, the exporting the shop, you

635
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,500
know, a cinematic of the scope for Maya and the the at least just the

636
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,100
animation stuff, not even including all are sort of real-time tracks.

637
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,300
This is just the straight out animation stuff but just just a source

638
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,800
input data for the cuts in exporting from Maya just like save.

639
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,700
This file was something like 30 minutes.

640
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,400
Wow.

641
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,000
Just save the file so you have an exported it or that is the X.

642
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
Are you talking about just saving them for the modified.

643
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Okay.

644
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,100
Saving the cloud of all right through my would you dare defy like this

645
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,400
is not including all our stuff or building or setting up a cinematic

646
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,600
so exporting the colada files for 30 minutes.

647
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah.

648
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,300
Okay so that was brutal.

649
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,800
So you can afford to to export the the stuff from Maya like 16 times a

650
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,200
day tops or something like this the before it's impossible.

651
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
It actually runs out the word.

652
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:29,800
Yeah.

653
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,200
To make start making your next change before the previous one is even

654
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,900
exported.

655
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:36,900
You know, that was brutal and that's something, you know, that we've,

656
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,000
that we have since tried to work around and, and, you know, we have

657
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,900
looked into, you know, obviously writing a better exporter for for

658
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,900
colada and you're looking at alternatives to plot ultimately, but I,

659
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,000
you know, I think for now we'll probably see it.

660
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,000
So, it's kind of on your radar, but it has not been solved.

661
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
Like, it's still like a minute.

662
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,800
We have, we have enough, we have enough in terms of

663
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,000
Workarounds of the problem.

664
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,500
Okay, so that it's not, yeah, it's not on my radar immediately like,

665
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,600
we can work around it and we can make it so that it's not like the

666
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
animators can make it.

667
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,100
So it's not 30-minute export for instance, by just not having one

668
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,400
giant one, okay, ready?

669
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,000
They just break it up into pieces and they can pull them in because

670
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,400
you said you have.

671
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
So, we have full access to all the in real Indigo simple.

672
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,800
Its work around mobile, it's not ideal, but it's work around the wall

673
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
and so, yeah.

674
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,500
But it's cinematics remains a problem.

675
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,800
Will always remain a problem.

676
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,900
There's always something.

677
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,500
So, I just wanted to share that exporting.

678
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,000
Cinematics is from the beginning, we all share.

679
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So let's see.

680
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
I can't read my own notes.

681
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm guessing I probably won't be any better.

682
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,800
So okay, so I'll just skip to the next one and you were talking a lot

683
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,800
about swf reader importing importing, right?

684
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,100
I don't have any as I don't have any Swift stories but I reminded me

685
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,000
of two things.

686
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,100
One is in terms of, you know you said you just sort of sat down and

687
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,800
read it, you know, read the fuckin neck, like great, you know, and

688
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,300
everybody clapped.

689
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,700
Yeah, every read the manual.

690
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,700
So yes, first of all, read the manual, I mean, looking at your, you

691
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,000
know whatever.

692
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,800
If you using, you know, you know, most people here okay.

693
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:36,400
He was either not using and x64 base x86 64 base or armed a CPU in

694
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,900
this room.

695
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,100
That's going to be no.

696
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,800
Be all right.

697
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,400
Okay, there's one nanak 64 non-armed.

698
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Okay, so that would be so to cover all of you, except that one guy

699
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,600
right there, you can read, you know, between amd's manuals Intel's

700
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,000
manuals and

701
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,100
And the our manuals, you know, every single one of you should have

702
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,800
already read these manuals, right?

703
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,300
And I suspect you don't let the Intel architecture guide.

704
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:10,300
Yeah, you know, or and he's documentation, but yeah, the the Intel

705
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,100
books for sure.

706
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,500
Yeah.

707
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,100
Or the arm manuals, right?

708
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,500
But here's the thing without putting it on the spot.

709
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,400
I'm pretty confident that 100% of you have not.

710
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,000
In fact, read those annuals and that's kind of shitty

711
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,300
That's your spending the most of your time on these architectures

712
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
spending most of your, you know, you're going to probably spend a long

713
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
time, right?

714
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,100
You certainly going to spend more than a few months and so it's worth

715
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,200
it if you're spending more than a few months on piece of architecture,

716
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,000
it's worth it.

717
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,900
And this is, you know, and I come from Consul background and you know

718
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
what a we you know, every few years or every five years or whatever,

719
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,800
they just throw away the shit that we've done and gives something

720
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,700
completely different.

721
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,500
It's still worth reading the manual, even though, we know they're

722
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,000
going to throw it away, right?

723
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,200
So just, you know, definitely do that mean take the lesson and the

724
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,800
fact you all clapped is indicative that you think it's a good idea.

725
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,400
Um so just go home and do that.

726
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,400
I also, you know, when do we basically you're equating reading the SWS

727
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,700
factor out, an importer with writing, you know, if you're going to

728
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,900
write code in this architecture, read the actual architecture.

729
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,500
You know what it is?

730
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,200
Yeah.

731
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,400
I mean, you should know.

732
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,700
I agree.

733
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,100
Obviously.

734
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,900
There's there's information there that you could find useful.

735
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,500
That is canonical.

736
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,100
Yeah, you start there, right basic, you know, don't don't assume.

737
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,700
Yeah.

738
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,300
Yeah.

739
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,100
I'd also there's other, you know, it also reminded me of the iff

740
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,400
format document, which I think is a classic.

741
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,000
You mean, like the iff document from Electronic Arts?

742
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,700
Yeah, the original one.

743
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah.

744
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,300
Okay.

745
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,700
So do just for people who aren't as old, as we are, tell them what

746
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,100
that is.

747
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,800
Most people probably don't know what iff is.

748
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,300
I have this format really, really simple format.

749
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,500
It breaks breaks things into blocks and has a basically, a header

750
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,700
definition that says, size and type, right?

751
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
Was it was yet for Electronic Arts back.

752
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,900
You in?

753
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't know when they introduced it, probably maybe two or something

754
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,300
like that.

755
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:10,699
Yeah, so it's like a for B type, I think for bite size and they're

756
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,600
usually asking so 16-bit size, right?

757
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,199
No, I don't remember.

758
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Anyway, so it's very straightforward.

759
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,400
I think it's 32 bit now, but I.

760
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,900
Yeah, anyway, doesn't matter, it's not matter.

761
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,699
The point is that we can look it up.

762
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,500
That's the point that it's well documented and it was well documented

763
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,300
in 1982, well before.

764
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,000
You know well before was you know when it would be what we thought was

765
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,300
a good idea to do it and I think it's the gold standard which we still

766
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,199
have yet to follow very well of sharing documentation and sharing

767
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,800
ideas and being very clear about these formats.

768
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,500
So are you saying that you don't feel like modern-day sort of the

769
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,800
modern-day way of doing file formats?

770
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
And that sort of stuff does not adhere to this, I guess are

771
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,400
Perhaps talking about something like PSD.

772
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,700
For example where you look at the speck and it's like, what is this?

773
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,300
Well okay history is a good example.

774
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,500
Okay.

775
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:06,900
Right.

776
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,200
It's not well documented, yeah great but I'm also talking about your

777
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,100
own formats, okay?

778
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,800
So you're talking about like on a game so you're making you know, a

779
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,100
Ratchet and Clank game or something this and you have some file

780
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,400
formats.

781
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,400
If you're doing you actually think for example that your team should

782
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,600
document those internal only file formats, for example.

783
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,300
Yes.

784
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,400
Okay, so why?

785
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay, why?

786
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,200
Why should you document your involve internal?

787
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,100
Why would you document an internal only file for?

788
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,800
I mean, it describes the data write it, it's a, you know, and Source,

789
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
the in Source, inputs to your system.

790
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,100
And it's the putting, you know, probably the most important thing that

791
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,200
you're working, okay?

792
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,500
Now the most important set of things that you're working with

793
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,100
everything else can be derived from that.

794
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,600
If I can look at, if I can understand the source input data, then I

795
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,300
can pretty much figure out what the rest of the system is, do we must

796
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,400
do, okay, right.

797
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,800
So I'm pretty sure that if I took, you know, any any

798
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,400
Cherry game out there and I said this is a description of what the

799
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,000
source data looks like, and I just released it to the hacker

800
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,800
Community, they can go to town on this game and because that's the

801
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,000
most important information.

802
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,500
Okay?

803
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,600
And that's obvious, that is the most important information.

804
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
Like, that's the thing that you would want to start with.

805
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,000
And yet we don't do a great job about documenting.

806
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,900
What is, you know, probably the most important information that we're

807
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,600
working with.

808
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,800
Do you think that's something that needs to be done during the

809
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,400
The active development so that there's a document which actually

810
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
evolves with changes to that data.

811
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,700
Or are you saying more like, when the game ships, part of the process

812
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,900
of shipping should be to take the final state of the data and document

813
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,400
that?

814
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,800
Well, I think you should be accurate.

815
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,000
So however, that works whatever the way.

816
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,200
So at the day, that the thing ships, whatever the way is to make sure

817
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,900
that the that the data description is the most accurate.

818
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,700
That is the thing.

819
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,900
You would like to see happen.

820
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,800
Yeah, I mean, I think that some teams for instance, doing it,

821
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Great ships would be a really bad idea because that's the most

822
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,300
stressful thriving for the team.

823
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,100
And they're already overwhelmed already working extra hard and to say,

824
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,000
you know what, I know you are working on this sort of like 500 bugs on

825
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,900
20 different species and some guys and stuff, you know, I know you're

826
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,400
working on that.

827
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
But can you write some documentation on this file?

828
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,000
Format ground?

829
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The slap goes the other direction, right?

830
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,300
Right, it's like Wham.

831
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,200
So that's probably not going to fly for some teams, right?

832
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,800
Okay, so it may be much better to do it, you know, incrementally.

833
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
We as you go and as you change it, just make it part of the change

834
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,500
process.

835
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,500
But you know, I do think we're talking about, you know, multiple

836
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,000
different things.

837
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,600
I think we're all talking about the internal formats and we are, but

838
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,900
we're also talking about the external things.

839
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,800
When we share, right?

840
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,900
Making that interoperability more more possible, it does seem like

841
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,800
there's been, I don't want to say a loss of that but there's

842
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
definitely, I guess less of a external incentive for that now, to some

843
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,100
degree to, because I guess it's just the first time I've ever thought

844
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,900
about this, because I don't think anyone's ever said that to me

845
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,500
before.

846
00:37:59,700 --> 00:37:59,800
So,

847
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,100
Kind of like going in my brain.

848
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,900
So, in the past, we saw things, like, for example, Doom had a very

849
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,100
well-documented file format, so that people could mod it and it led to

850
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,300
there's a complete understanding pretty much of everything that goes

851
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,900
into that game or something like this.

852
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,300
But as I suggest we get more towards the Steam Workshop style of like,

853
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,000
there's just these tools that people use and nobody's ever really

854
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,600
touching the data besides the programmers.

855
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,200
I guess there's no longer much external pressure on a developer

856
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,700
because they're, you know, maybe it's all integrated inside.

857
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,900
Oh, it wouldn't we maybe wouldn't see things like doing so much

858
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,400
anymore.

859
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,000
I mean, is that a fair characterization?

860
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Perhaps of that?

861
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,400
Well, I think one of the things that we should consider is, you know,

862
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
the sort of the historical aspect, right?

863
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,600
And, you know, how easy it is to Archive and say, Yes things, right?

864
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,400
I mean, we can, certainly imagine it being much easier to save much

865
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,200
easier to save an older game, which is you're saving.

866
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,100
Certainly an old again.

867
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,700
That's well, documented much easier to

868
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,700
4:20 any sort of keep it alive?

869
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,100
Yes.

870
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,800
And the less information you have about it.

871
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,200
The less you know it's a harder it is to save and we're talking about,

872
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,300
you know if we're once we get into sort of a mulch much the last 10

873
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,700
years, basically it's already hard problem, right?

874
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:15,800
Yeah.

875
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,600
How to Archive a PS3 game that's all runs on a network on PSN.

876
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:20,900
Yeah.

877
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,100
Right.

878
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,200
Is already a really, really hard problem.

879
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,200
And to make that even harder is, you know, maybe pretty much assume

880
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,900
presumes that it's not important to to Archive the

881
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,500
Te and, you know, we're going to lose a lot of that data.

882
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you know, I don't know if that's important everybody.

883
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,800
And I don't really, I don't I have I'm undecided of whether or not

884
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,500
it's important to me and the scope of thing.

885
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,400
But if it were important that if we're importantly, is the case that

886
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,100
we're not really.

887
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,200
Yeah, not set up for it.

888
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,900
I suppose.

889
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean there's something else I think that comes up and practice

890
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,200
right?

891
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,500
When we you know at some point somebody's going to say, hey, can you

892
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,500
port this forward right?

893
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,100
Yeah.

894
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,500
You know can you take this?

895
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,800
You know, assuming like okay, super weak point taken.

896
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,500
That's right.

897
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,700
We're talking about signore speaking.

898
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,900
You know, you've, you know, it's not that long ago, right?

899
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,900
But he's, you know, would you guys consider a classic at this point?

900
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,800
Yes, more or less, right?

901
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,200
Which means that in 10 years somebody's probably going to think about

902
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
it, we remember it want to play it again, right?

903
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,300
Maybe all this architecture that we currently presume is different,

904
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,700
very, very different, right?

905
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,500
And someone's going to want to pour it and then somebody's going to

906
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:29,800
ask

907
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,200
not you, but the mountains of people that work for you to board it,

908
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,800
right?

909
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,500
And you're going to go what the fuck.

910
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,600
I don't even remember.

911
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,700
You know, that was 10 years ago, I'm going to have to watch videos of

912
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,500
me myself, talking about at even remember what I was doing.

913
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,800
And, you know, having the ability to go back and, you know, have that

914
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
well, be well documented at least in terms of what the formats were

915
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,200
and what the data looks like.

916
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,800
So you could in theory, you're in, you know, you know, at least break.

917
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,100
Down and figure out what the cost is of pulling forward would be

918
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,800
totally worthwhile and I suspect very strongly that that will in fact

919
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,400
happen that, you know, in some at some future point that this will

920
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,700
happen to on some architecture that's hard for us to imagine today and

921
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,700
that you will have completely forgotten what all the data looks like,

922
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,200
right?

923
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,900
So, yes, I don't know what the question.

924
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, yeah.

925
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,600
So another completely random Point great.

926
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,100
I'm as I have no no insight into the into the list, this is still the

927
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,400
same point and still we're still talking about swf, right?

928
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,500
So the one thing one document, I think everybody should read is the

929
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Tim berners-lee.

930
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,500
World Wide, Web hitched document.

931
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,100
This is really, this is, you know, I want to make a world wide web.

932
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,800
This is the pitch.

933
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
This is, this is what I'm going to make.

934
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,600
It is very short.

935
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,300
It's like a few.

936
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,100
Just long everyone should read this.

937
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,300
Because what you will learn is pretty much

938
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,800
The he set out to accomplish all the problems that he set out to

939
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,100
accomplish.

940
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,200
Now imagine this world why you know this is before the web so this is

941
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,100
early 90s.

942
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,900
I was and everything that he sent out to call it all these problems

943
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:20,200
that we want to solve, he's literally solved, none of them all.

944
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,300
I like if you imagine how much the world has changed right?

945
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,700
How much the web has changed, everything everything that we do and I

946
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,900
how we interact with each other and

947
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,600
And on business and, you know, everything and yet fundamentally.

948
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
We saw none of these problems.

949
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I'm very interested to see what they are now.

950
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,200
And, you know, which is really, you know, it's really about, you know,

951
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,400
you know, it starts with.

952
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Like, I can't find these documents that are important to me, you know,

953
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,700
and this is so complicated, I can find the document.

954
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,600
Okay, who has a problem finding information that, you know, is

955
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,600
relevant to their work right today, right?

956
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,700
That's still true.

957
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,800
It's still true that it's

958
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
To find that document.

959
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,600
It's still true that.

960
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,000
You know, even if you have what he imagined was something you know,

961
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,800
very clearly.

962
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,500
Something like a Wiki, right?

963
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,800
Okay.

964
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,400
How many people have Wiki's that survived the test of time.

965
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
Like after five years you can find everything.

966
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
It's totally there.

967
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,000
It's totally documented.

968
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,700
Well, okay, to be fair though to them as soon as they finish figuring

969
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,900
out how to turn these important documents into Justin Bieber songs

970
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,600
with the rebel were perfectly, right?

971
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,700
Because you can always find them.

972
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,400
Those.

973
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,700
So I'm not down on Justin Bieber.

974
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:40,200
I fair enough buying, I'm a huge pop fan.

975
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,000
But yes, continue, it's a data transformation problem.

976
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,500
We just have to take the things we can find and turn the things.

977
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,200
We can't find into that.

978
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,000
I think this is, I think there is some legitimacy to that argument,

979
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,000
you know, I think,

980
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,700
You know, and it's in terms of what you can associate, you know,

981
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,300
formation with.

982
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,500
I think there's some legitimacy but in terms of taking the lesson of,

983
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,000
you know, you have and I don't know what to take away from this.

984
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,400
You've taken, you know, you taking a problem of insurmountable scope.

985
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,300
You know, I want to be able to get this, I wanna be able to track down

986
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,000
this information.

987
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,500
I want to be able to communicate with people, and I want to be able to

988
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,900
very specific things.

989
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,600
Like I can't find the document that I want.

990
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,100
I want such a, you know, Association that I want something.

991
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,900
That's all of this for me.

992
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,500
Me and which is sort of always been a problem in this room all of

993
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,100
human history.

994
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,500
Yes.

995
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,600
And say I have a solution for it and it changes the world and yet and

996
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
yet the and still can't find the document that you want.

997
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,900
I find that fascinating and I don't know what the lesson is but it's

998
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:48,900
super fascinating.

999
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,800
So yeah.

1000
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,600
Like I guess so you're basically saying take a look at this pitch

1001
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,700
document, see the things he said he wanted to solve.

1002
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,600
Yeah he hasn't managed to solve any of them.

1003
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,800
I guess, even though he created a whole bunch of solutions

1004
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,100
Problems or whole new problems even because they support we've done

1005
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,400
right?

1006
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,800
We create more problem, created a lot more problems.

1007
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,900
Super fascinating, interesting problems, huge hugely interests and

1008
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,800
you're sitting over there.

1009
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,400
Listening to Tom, you talked about importing, an swf file.

1010
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,800
Yeah.

1011
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,800
And that was what this is that was well yeah, there's a connection,

1012
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,000
right?

1013
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,400
There's swf format during document and something to do with that

1014
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
document anyway, there you go.

1015
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,700
Alright, so I have some questions for you.

1016
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,300
I want to ask.

1017
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:29,800
Is there anything?

1018
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,900
Us in the on the list, for sure, but go ahead.

1019
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,700
All right, because I wanted to ask the things that I can only ask you,

1020
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,100
or at least out of the people that are at handmade Khan.

1021
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,200
So going back to, you know, putting documents aside for one second

1022
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,000
because as we already said, you can't find them anyway.

1023
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,400
So you know there, it's largely academic where you can't read them or

1024
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
you can't read them, you can't read them or we can't find them either

1025
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,300
or one of the things that I wanted to ask you or to try to get some

1026
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,900
perspective on because like, I opened this with

1027
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
A question that I had for you that I didn't know the answer to that.

1028
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,900
People often ask me, which was the, you know, sort of scaling you

1029
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,200
know, scaling up does that change versus whatever that sort of stuff.

1030
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,400
But then another question that I get asked also.

1031
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,100
So let's go back to that question.

1032
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,300
So scaling up very important.

1033
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,400
Let's put your other one aside from there is a minute, so scaling up.

1034
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,000
So, you know, I'd sometimes I talk to it like Indie groups, whose in

1035
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,900
the considers themselves, Indian the room.

1036
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,600
Fair number.

1037
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,200
Okay, that's a pretty good number.

1038
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,300
Sometimes, I talk to interview some down talking to you guys any

1039
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,700
group.

1040
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,200
And I'll talk to me about the engine that they're making or, you know,

1041
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,100
that they want to make.

1042
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,500
And I'll be asking questions and, and often what I'll see is that they

1043
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,400
are doing it very similar to say, what we would do or they're looking

1044
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,000
at unity and they're doing something similar to Unity or unreal or

1045
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,500
whatever.

1046
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,700
The sort of copy means make like looking at, you know,

1047
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,400
Making sort of an editor thing that you put entities down.

1048
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,800
Like, yeah, I already ordered the runtime or the the tools.

1049
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,300
Okay, whatever.

1050
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,700
And I have no problem with people making their own tools and, you

1051
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,300
know, fundamentally I'm engine programmer and, you know, that's kind

1052
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,100
of what I like to do.

1053
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,100
So I get I get it and, you know, I don't have a problem with people

1054
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,600
doing that and that's what you like to do.

1055
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,400
But you know what, I think that people Miss is the context in which

1056
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,200
they're working, you know, you're working with a Yorkie on a game,

1057
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:28,700
right?

1058
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,200
Right.

1059
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,200
You know, you're in space, or working by yourself or with a group of

1060
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,100
people or students, you're working with group of students or whatever

1061
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,100
and you're missing the context in which you're working.

1062
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:41,200
You're looking at what other people have done and you're sort of just

1063
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,600
copying that model, okay?

1064
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,200
Right.

1065
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,700
And so you're looking at unreal, you're looking at unity and you're

1066
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,400
saying okay, they have actors in enemies and things that I'm sort of,

1067
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,000
copying them all because that's how you do it.

1068
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,800
And I think that in the same way that, you know, taking a physical

1069
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,700
model, mental model, and saying this is the, this must be right now.

1070
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
Everything else is wrong.

1071
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,900
This is also poor approached.

1072
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,300
Okay.

1073
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,000
You know because Insomniac did it because epic did it or because

1074
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
whoever did it that must be the right approach.

1075
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I'm just going to sort of copy.

1076
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That is also wrong, okay?

1077
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,300
Because it has nothing to do with your problem, okay?

1078
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,400
It has to do with our problem.

1079
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,600
Those are very, very different and to talk about, you know, to go back

1080
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,700
to your point, which is sort of what's the difference of scale?

1081
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,100
Yes.

1082
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,800
Right the difference is huge, its its massive.

1083
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,700
So when you talk about one game or at least one game at a time and

1084
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,000
you're talkin,

1085
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,200
Entertainment Group of small people who are small group.

1086
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,600
We will communicate really on a deep level, right?

1087
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,300
You have seven people or 10, people are five people or whatever.

1088
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,500
Yes, they can just communicate together on a deep level that totally

1089
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,300
changes the game.

1090
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,500
I was talking to one team recently and you know, it was just sort of

1091
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:46,900
breaking down.

1092
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,700
They started out with the actors important thing.

1093
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,000
Similar.

1094
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,100
I'm just like, okay, why do you even have this?

1095
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,600
Like conceptually like, these are the components I have.

1096
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,600
I'm like, forget forget all this, okay.

1097
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,200
What you know, what's your game?

1098
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,700
What do you at?

1099
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,000
What are the problems are actually trying to solve.

1100
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,100
And they would say something like,

1101
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,500
Like okay.

1102
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,800
Well we have ladders and our game, all right?

1103
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,400
Okay cool.

1104
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
We can start with ladders like okay why do you have ladders and what

1105
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:05,700
are they doing?

1106
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,300
But let's start with ladders was saying.

1107
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,900
The difference between what you're talking about.

1108
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,200
Building you're talking are building sort of the general purpose

1109
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
editor where you know I can you know, design is going to spend time

1110
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,700
placing a ladder and setting and assigning it a ladder component and

1111
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,500
doing all like.

1112
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Now imagine different scenario by comparison.

1113
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,500
I know the context in which I'm making the game, you guys are like

1114
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,100
seven people.

1115
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm going to make an editor that that understands that I like that.

1116
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,600
I use ladder.

1117
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:29,900
There's a lot.

1118
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,900
Button right there is a literal ladder button and it shows me on the

1119
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,400
screen.

1120
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,300
All the, only the places that a ladder could have possibly appear,

1121
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:38,700
right?

1122
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,000
Right.

1123
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,700
And understand the constraints, I've defined the constraints under,

1124
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,600
which a lot of compared.

1125
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,500
So, it's sort of ghosting in all the places that it could possibly

1126
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,800
appear and I just click on one.

1127
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,500
That's the one ladder goes there.

1128
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,200
That's like three seconds to put a ladder.

1129
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,200
I don't have to waste time, like dragging some object in and it's an

1130
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,600
arbitrary model is attached to some arbitrary about it because I'm not

1131
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,600
making an arbitrary game.

1132
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,800
I'm making this game.

1133
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,600
Yes, and I'm making tools for this game, and the fact that you have

1134
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,000
that much more context means you can solve the problem that much

1135
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,500
better ignoring the context, or alternatively, if you want to look at

1136
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,700
a different way, is trying to make it too generic.

1137
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,800
Yeah, is the call, you're causing problems, you're making it slower.

1138
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,400
It's like you're intentionally making the problem Harder by ignoring

1139
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,500
the context by the trying to make it to generic.

1140
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,000
It's basically the analog of what you were talking about with code

1141
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,300
before.

1142
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,500
It's just like, don't introduce extra things in here.

1143
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,000
If they were not actually relevant to solving the

1144
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,100
And to say it has to be generic or has to follow this.

1145
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,800
Other model is introducing this whole mental abstraction this whole

1146
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,800
mental model into the problem that just didn't exist and also doesn't

1147
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,500
make it an order of magnitude harder.

1148
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,800
It also doesn't seem clear why you would really want to go that route

1149
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,500
because if you just want to end up with unity or unreal again, you

1150
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,200
could have just used them.

1151
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,700
Well, first, you should be trying to do something that you want to do

1152
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:50,900
this.

1153
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,200
For sure.

1154
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,500
That's your advantage, I think.

1155
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,400
And that's that.

1156
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,000
Just your advantage is an indie in the space, right?

1157
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,700
Is that you have that deep understanding of your context, you can take

1158
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,800
it.

1159
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,100
Intimate, you can write things that are just the cannot be, they

1160
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,600
cannot be used to make anything else.

1161
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:04,900
Yes.

1162
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,300
But they just kick ass at this one thing and that's awesome.

1163
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,200
And even our scale, right?

1164
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,200
We can do that better than say a team that has to support.

1165
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,200
You know, you know, millions of people yeah or you know hundreds of

1166
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,400
thousands of people like we can do it better than that, but we still

1167
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,700
can't do it to the extent that a small one.

1168
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,000
Or this one.

1169
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,100
We do have multiple games and fly that all have slight differences.

1170
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,700
And we do have to be more, you know, support a wider range of stuff so

1171
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,900
we can't even be as good.

1172
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,700
As those smaller teams, so that's their advantage anyway.

1173
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,700
That that know, that was accent.

1174
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,200
I love the list scaling.

1175
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,700
So, anyway, back to your mom.

1176
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,300
Yes.

1177
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:48,100
So my question is, sort of a couple different questions that, but it's

1178
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,800
sort of all the same basic idea.

1179
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,300
Which is that, you know, when I got into the game industry, it was so

1180
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:58,400
long ago that it didn't look anything like it looks now, for example.

1181
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,900
So, a lot of times, you know,

1182
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,400
Really cuz with the series it's you know, a lot of people who aren't

1183
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,200
in the game industry but might want to get in the game show.

1184
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,700
You are starting to, you know, watch it or try to practice or do the

1185
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:08,800
stuff.

1186
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,000
And I get asked the question like, what should I, you know, what

1187
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,900
should I do?

1188
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,700
If I actually want to pursue a career here like what does that look

1189
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:16,900
like?

1190
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,100
And I get all kinds of questions that I simply can't answer.

1191
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,300
Should I go to college?

1192
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,300
What should I be practicing?

1193
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,400
What does my resume associative?

1194
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,900
Like how do I apply all these sorts of things?

1195
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,100
So I was wondering as someone who actually presumably has a little

1196
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,500
more insight into.

1197
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:36,300
A the process by which people come into the industry now and to as

1198
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,500
someone who presumably has spots they need to fill on occasion and I

1199
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,900
would imagine has a bunch of things.

1200
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,500
They wish were true about the people who were coming through the door,

1201
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,600
like, could you give me a little perspective on that?

1202
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,400
So when I get asked that question, I can say well, I don't know, but

1203
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Mike said this right.

1204
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,900
If it's too tough of a question that we do not have an opinion, I can

1205
00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,600
certainly share.

1206
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,400
Have an opinion about everything.

1207
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,200
But to start with, I mean I agree with your point that it's really

1208
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,200
hard for me to relate to people who are getting into the games

1209
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,700
industry.

1210
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,300
Now as a concept, like I can't I simply can't I don't have that that

1211
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,300
exact experience that you're dealing with right now.

1212
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,300
I have nothing to relate to that.

1213
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,700
You know, there's this mountain of schools you can choose from like

1214
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,200
right?

1215
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,400
I don't even know what that's like.

1216
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,900
Yeah, dr.

1217
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,600
Self out.

1218
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,300
You know you have the internet and yes, documentation and examples and

1219
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,000
so yeah, it's completely different.

1220
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,100
It's playing field that I don't, you know that I don't know.

1221
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,800
The best person to ask somebody who just did it like four years ago, I

1222
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,100
guess so.

1223
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,100
You know, that they're the best people to ask.

1224
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,200
But in terms of hiring, I can certainly give you an insight into what

1225
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,100
I look for, you know, I over time.

1226
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:54,100
I've looked for things that correlates strongly with good hires, you

1227
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:57,700
know, and whether that's, you know what school you're going to or your

1228
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,800
test scores, we do have a test.

1229
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Give it programming, we do give apartment test-retest, you know, your

1230
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,100
your response to them a test or your work history or whatever.

1231
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,700
You know, I'm trying to look for things that correlates strongly with

1232
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,100
with good.

1233
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,400
What I would consider good hires and there's only there's literally

1234
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,300
only one thing that I found that correlates and everything else

1235
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,300
doesn't and really really really hard.

1236
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,600
Because it just doesn't like I said whether or not whether or not you

1237
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,500
pass our tests.

1238
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:29,600
Well actually doesn't really correlate.

1239
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,100
Strongly with how good of a programmer you're going to be for us.

1240
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,300
Why do you still get it partially?

1241
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,900
Because a, you know it there there are bits in there.

1242
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,400
That do tell me something.

1243
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:42,800
Okay.

1244
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,600
So I do find it useful, or insightful.

1245
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,700
Part of it is just for your like what do I do?

1246
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,900
If I don't have it, I don't have an alternative answer here.

1247
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,800
Fair enough.

1248
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,500
Okay.

1249
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,300
You know, I am human during the day, so yeah, I don't have, you know,

1250
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,500
Motivator.

1251
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,100
Yeah.

1252
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,100
So yeah.

1253
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,700
I mean, the one thing that I have found that correlates is curiosity,

1254
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,900
curiosity.

1255
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,400
That's literally the only thing and curiosity to a point where it's

1256
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,400
insatiable where I cannot words undeniable like, you know, I'm if I'm

1257
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,200
talking to somebody and they aren't they aren't, is they are very

1258
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,800
curious.

1259
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,200
Ultimately, it's obvious that they are very curious.

1260
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,900
Interesting, you know, I'm going to ask questions and they're going to

1261
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:31,000
say, I do not only do I not know, but I don't care.

1262
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,500
Okay.

1263
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,100
All right.

1264
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:32,700
It's not important.

1265
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,500
From you to know that it should do my job.

1266
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,700
So I haven't thought about it right.

1267
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:42,800
I see that's and just a level of non curiosity that I that just

1268
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,400
doesn't do well for working with with the group that I work it right

1269
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
with my team.

1270
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,100
Now, on the flip side, somebody who's insatiably curious, right,

1271
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,300
where, it's just like everything, they may not have enough.

1272
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,700
You certainly don't have enough time to satisfy at all but you want to

1273
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,300
know you're interested in knowing, right?

1274
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,600
You dig in and that sort of thing.

1275
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,700
It correlates strongly with being successful on our team.

1276
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,400
How is that help people?

1277
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,600
Who are, you know, trying find a job?

1278
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,500
I don't know.

1279
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,900
Well, it kind of does, he's curious me?

1280
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,800
Curious certainly first unless but, but maybe demonstrate, you know,

1281
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,300
demonstrable curiosity right.

1282
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,700
Show me that you are soaked, you're curious about something deeply

1283
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,300
from, you know, top to bottom.

1284
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,700
You know, even it's just like one really great blog post where you

1285
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,100
just dug into something deeply and you've just kept digging until you

1286
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,400
hit sand, right?

1287
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:32,600
And you

1288
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,500
just like, this is everything that I could possibly learn about this

1289
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,100
in a month.

1290
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,700
Yeah, right.

1291
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,100
All the little tangents all the little interesting bits, I just pulled

1292
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,300
every thread until I ran out of time right over a month or whatever

1293
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,500
that's interesting and that would be that would be striking to me and

1294
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,000
that's something that I would want to see if it's just like oh here

1295
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
are three projects that I did and you know very it's not in that not

1296
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,500
even a little bit interesting to me really especially if the school

1297
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,900
projects because it's like everybody today they had to do them right?

1298
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
So it's whatever it's Anna.

1299
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,800
Big deal.

1300
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,900
You know, I think that I don't care about, you know, I don't really

1301
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,400
care about what school you went to.

1302
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't really care about your grades.

1303
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,600
I don't, we're certainly don't care about what, what projects you did.

1304
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,500
I don't care about what classes you took.

1305
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,100
I don't care anything at all to do with your school.

1306
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:20,100
I don't actually even care if you passed or finished or interesting.

1307
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,700
So, yeah.

1308
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,300
I mean, I care about sort of what you've demonstrated most of what

1309
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,600
you've demonstrated on your own will?

1310
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes, that's what, what,

1311
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,100
Interested in that's a fantastic answer.

1312
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,600
So thank you very much.

1313
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,700
It's like all right so I guess I guess my secondary question maybe is

1314
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,500
not as well in fact that was kind of perfect but I guess I'll just ask

1315
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,100
it anyway which was so you know if there was something that I was

1316
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,600
going to tell people, you should practice or know how to do is there

1317
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,700
anything that you find lacking in terms of fundamentals, right?

1318
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,700
Like it's like, hey, I wish that all the applicants we got like

1319
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,000
Even the ones who were curious and like, you know, they have the right

1320
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,100
mentality for being on the engine team at Insomniac that like, that's

1321
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:07,500
all set.

1322
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,300
But I just wish they had done more of X or known more about, why would

1323
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,900
have been really helpful to us, right?

1324
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,300
So separate from maybe the hiring question, just more like, what do

1325
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:19,600
you want them to be prepped to do when they get there?

1326
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,400
Lots of Java programming, right?

1327
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm guessing.

1328
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,400
So again, the answer is not very, not a very technically, specific

1329
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,800
answer, the answer is practice, okay?

1330
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:38,000
Most people do not know how to practice, okay, and most people don't

1331
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,500
take it very seriously and that I think is a massive problem for our

1332
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,800
full as massive problem for them.

1333
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,300
Really massive problem for you and your career.

1334
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,300
If you don't know how to practice and you know not taking seriously as

1335
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:50,500
a big

1336
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,400
You assume that, you know, I'm learning, you know, I'm going what I

1337
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
need to know based on what I'm doing in my my job.

1338
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,200
Well you know, that's not enough, okay, it's your career right, you

1339
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:06,200
need to take you know, you need to take that seriously as a your own

1340
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,300
problem, you know.

1341
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,400
And how do you learn and how do you practice and how do you advance

1342
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,800
your skills for your own career?

1343
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,200
This is your responsibility.

1344
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,600
Yes, you have a job and you're going to do that work.

1345
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,400
That's great.

1346
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,300
But separately, you have to deal with your career and where you're

1347
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:20,700
going and

1348
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,000
And what you need to know and you have to know how to do that.

1349
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,400
Well, and most people do not know how to practice.

1350
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,100
Well, you know, I talked to somebody and I'll say, you know, what, you

1351
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,400
practice every day and they'll say, well, I don't really have time

1352
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,800
everyday, American really.

1353
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,700
So aside from putting aside from your family.

1354
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,400
Yeah, this is the most important.

1355
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,000
Like, this is the thing.

1356
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,800
You're gonna spend your entire life doing so you don't have time for

1357
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,200
the thing.

1358
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,600
Like, Jude forget to brush your teeth like, like you

1359
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,400
manage to do other things every day.

1360
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,500
Like you eat every day, you brush your teeth every day because it's

1361
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,400
important to you.

1362
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,400
You probably change your clothes every day.

1363
00:59:59,200 --> 00:59:59,800
He might show,

1364
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,700
Are there things you do every day?

1365
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,800
Because it's important because it's part of who you are and yet you

1366
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,700
don't practice every day.

1367
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,100
Write the thing that, you know, you don't do it for your career.

1368
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,000
And so, this is.

1369
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So second thing I'll get is, you know, well I have a little bit of

1370
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,400
time and I read as a programmer, I really need to be able to sit down

1371
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,400
for hours in order to get into the mood to I'm like okay you're not a

1372
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,200
child, you know, this is you know as a professional and as an adult

1373
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,000
person I think you should be able to

1374
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
To organize your time.

1375
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,600
So that, you know, you can get something out of 30 minutes, if that's

1376
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,800
all you have, you know, you can absolutely do that.

1377
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,400
You can absolutely have a plan for how I'm going to use this 30

1378
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,900
minutes and what I'm going to do and that's better than doing nothing.

1379
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,900
Yes, and you know, this is, you know, it's just some sort of a series

1380
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,700
of excuses of why I don't practice right and I don't know how to

1381
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,700
practice and so not taking that seriously, I think is a huge problem

1382
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,000
for people not not necessarily an in terms of their contribution to

1383
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,800
18.

1384
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,700
But for their own sake like as a programmer as an individual person

1385
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,600
with the career that you have to curate for yourself, like this is the

1386
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,200
investment that you need to put in.

1387
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,700
Or you're just not going to be as good as you could possibly be.

1388
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,600
And you know, that's a presumably what you want, right?

1389
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,000
You want to be as good as you can because this is your chosen career.

1390
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,300
So you need to spend that time you forgot to do it.

1391
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,600
Well, so what's a good example of how someone might practice for 30

1392
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,000
minutes?

1393
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,400
If they like, take this advice to heart and go, you know what?

1394
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,900
That is something.

1395
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,100
Should be doing, what's a good starter Project?

1396
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,800
A lot of times, I tell people who are starting out in games I'll be

1397
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,200
like asteroids is the one to make first, when you're like learning,

1398
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,800
you know, how to make games because it's the simplest possible thing

1399
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,000
and blah blah blah, right?

1400
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,400
So let's talk about practice, like you said it, what's the simplest

1401
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,100
way to get started?

1402
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,700
Practicing, what would you say would be somebody who have 30 minutes a

1403
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,200
day.

1404
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,900
You are going to start devoting to getting better at programming

1405
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:52,400
games?

1406
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,100
Well, I mean you could pick something like say, ah let's see we're

1407
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,500
going to pick asteroids right?

1408
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,800
Fine my biggest advice.

1409
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,800
Ice would be for while, for at least into, if you're just starting to

1410
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,400
learn how to practice, well is to throw away, throw away, everything

1411
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,700
you do after every practice, do not have any kind of continuity.

1412
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,200
Interesting.

1413
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,700
So maybe you work on the same problem, but you are not allowed to keep

1414
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,200
anything that you did before.

1415
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,500
So, that you simply have to get better at it.

1416
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,500
You have to be a fast.

1417
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,400
You have to try a different way next time and see if it works better

1418
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,200
and that sort of because if you if you keep it it doesn't become

1419
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
practice, right?

1420
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,900
It becomes a project.

1421
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,600
I say and it becomes about in becomes a hobby.

1422
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:33,800
Yes.

1423
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,300
Absolutely.

1424
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,200
And it's not about a hobby, it's about real practice.

1425
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,300
So just throw it away and didn't get better at it, right?

1426
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,900
So if it's about asteroids and then ultimately maybe your practices,

1427
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,000
how can you make it in 30 minutes what is what are you doing first?

1428
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,400
A 30 minute, you know, the first day you don't even close the second

1429
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,400
day, you don't even close.

1430
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:56,600
Yeah, 300th day, maybe your buddy close to be able to do it in 30

1431
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,000
minutes so you've done it so many times.

1432
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,200
That's practiced.

1433
01:02:59,200 --> 01:02:59,600
Okay.

1434
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,900
That's valuable right.

1435
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,900
Maybe you are not, maybe you're not practicing the right thing.

1436
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,000
You've gotten really good at building, asteroids at 30 minutes, but

1437
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,400
that's probably something valuable to be taken from that.

1438
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,800
But, I mean, really, I think it's, you know, I would say pick and pick

1439
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,500
pick pretty much anything right.

1440
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:19,800
Pick a project open source project, your own project whatever and just

1441
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,900
start picking it apart, right?

1442
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,800
You have a plan.

1443
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,700
What about how I'm going to spend?

1444
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,800
Spend the first two minutes saying?

1445
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,800
What am I to do for 30 minutes?

1446
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,800
Have a plant, got it.

1447
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,000
And if that's I'm going to analyze this so I can gather more

1448
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,800
information

1449
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,300
Or I'm going to make this bit faster or whatever.

1450
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,500
Fine do that.

1451
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,700
You know, you have a plan, spend your 30 minutes doing that and then

1452
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:41,300
stop and then throw it all the way and then tomorrow I have a new plan

1453
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,600
and that's you know it's a different it's a completely different kind

1454
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:49,800
of thing than a hobby or project or a portfolio piece or your work.

1455
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,200
Or it's just about the value of the practice is the practice of

1456
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,700
practice.

1457
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,200
So

1458
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,600
Well, I think we're just about out of time.

1459
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,800
So did you have any stuff you wanted to talk about?

1460
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,000
Just like you and I don't want to go back - do I miss anything on the

1461
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,900
list but also just as you wanted to say a few closing remarks just

1462
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,700
about, you know, I guess I asked Tommy sort of if he had any stuff he

1463
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,200
wanted to mention that he's working on or stuff that he wanted to talk

1464
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,000
about just as sort of a closing remark.

1465
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,300
So if you've got any, I don't know what you would.

1466
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:18,700
Yeah.

1467
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,100
What your days, look like these days, but what am I working on?

1468
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,800
So there was a problem.

1469
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,400
That I decided to dig into a little bit.

1470
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,900
We have something called a spatial DB which is not really database

1471
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,700
just spatial DB.

1472
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,100
Yeah.

1473
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:42,000
Just as we're very our it's a sort of our mechanism to query things

1474
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:50,300
spatially in our engine, we call it special TV and I was interested in

1475
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,900
it and sort of seeing where the edges were and seeing if there was

1476
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:59,800
anything that we could do in terms of optimization and so my Approach

1477
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,400
was,

1478
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,700
I wanted to let you know, I wanted to look into this more deeply so

1479
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,600
I'm just sort of sharing what my approach this was and so I thought

1480
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,000
okay, well maybe, you know, as the game is playing, I can sort of just

1481
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,900
serialize it at certain points and the next sort of sampling it right

1482
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,400
serializing.

1483
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,800
Then analyze it offline and say where was this at this point?

1484
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,300
And, you know, so I can look deeply more deeply into the data.

1485
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,400
So periodically, you would just sort of say at this, you know, every n

1486
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,300
seconds or something.

1487
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,900
I'm going to just same out.

1488
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,300
What is the DB look like yeah?

1489
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,300
Here ya later.

1490
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,300
I'll go gather them back up in a separate thing and start to see that

1491
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,600
was, that was my original plan right now, I'm looking at it.

1492
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,000
And I'm like, okay, well, one, the D, you know, the it's not really DB

1493
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
in any kind of it's in my, you know, it's just, it's interface.

1494
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And that format is fairly optimized in Fairly complicated and

1495
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,400
changing, and I'm like, you know what, I'm not gonna do that.

1496
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,800
I'm feeling a little lazy.

1497
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,600
So instead I said, well, you know what, I'm actually going to do is

1498
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,400
there's a very limited number of entry points into this, okay?

1499
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,500
And so, this

1500
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,800
This data are a very limited number of ways that you can even change

1501
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,200
the data.

1502
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,100
So those sort of like, add something to the database, our edit

1503
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,600
something are, delete it really, that's pretty much the whole end

1504
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,700
initially judgment.

1505
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,500
So that's pretty much it.

1506
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,200
I'm like fine.

1507
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,600
I'm just going to stream out like a command buffer.

1508
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,500
I'm going to stream out all the entry points, so case database.

1509
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,000
So like recreated offline.

1510
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Yes, right now and whenever programmer and says, I'm going to do

1511
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,300
something else because I'm feeling lazy.

1512
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,500
Usually, it involves way more work.

1513
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,900
Yes, the original thing which is the

1514
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,400
True absolutely in this case.

1515
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,100
So, you know, I streamed at all the entry point stuff, you know, and I

1516
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,200
sort of now I have a system that, you know, I see the command but from

1517
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,800
Reading system or of just read it all back and reconstruct the

1518
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
databases at any point.

1519
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,800
So I can have a complete timeline playing the game.

1520
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,400
Complete timeline I can scrub or whatever of everything that happened

1521
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,200
to the database at any point.

1522
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,900
While I was playing that's awesome.

1523
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:52,100
Right?

1524
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,200
As I can do a lot of queries in here and see how it's going and just

1525
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,000
sort of discovering sort of doing analysis and spent you're spinning

1526
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,800
out a bunch of data and

1527
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,800
Analyzing it, tons of information, that was super valuable.

1528
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,100
And then I said, you know what, there's a bunch of queries that are

1529
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,100
coming in, you know, people asking in the game, you know, I want to

1530
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:09,600
get stuff out of.

1531
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,900
That's the whole point of the did queer is especially if it's do

1532
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:12,600
queries against it.

1533
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,900
So I'm like I want to visualize the queries like visually like honesty

1534
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,200
you know what they look like.

1535
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,200
So I'm done.

1536
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:25,000
I'm in our queries, all come in this sort of convex Hull / defined by

1537
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,700
planes.

1538
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,800
Okay so comes in as a series of plane equation yes that bound some 3.

1539
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,400
Deep space like a polytope, right?

1540
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,200
So I'm like, okay, that's fine.

1541
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,900
You know, I want to visualize that someone to visualize it as the

1542
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:37,700
whole I'm Grand.

1543
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,000
Yeah, that's Polly's.

1544
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:43,800
So we have a clipping function that will take, you know, to set of

1545
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,900
plans include against a predefined whole.

1546
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:52,800
So right triangle, you know, defined whole and so I'm like, okay,

1547
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,400
that's cool.

1548
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,500
I'll just take a big, basically a big Cube and Slice It Up by right.

1549
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,800
Just make sure the cube is bigger than whatever the bounds on this.

1550
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,400
Planes are and then I'll just let it carve everything.

1551
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,600
That's not the elephant.

1552
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,300
We remove that marble and the elephants left.

1553
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:05,500
Right?

1554
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:05,800
Yeah.

1555
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,100
So it's fairly straightforward, which we use for various things and

1556
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,200
I'm just going to use this to sort of visualize the space, okay?

1557
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:13,700
Right.

1558
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:19,899
And it doesn't work in some cases, okay?

1559
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:24,000
So I'm looking at it, I'm like okay well you know there's this cases

1560
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,500
where it's just, you know, I'm just basically getting garbage out.

1561
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,500
Yes, right.

1562
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:32,600
And you know, I am just where I want to visualize any comment, you do

1563
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,700
it.

1564
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,899
Turns out that the problem is in that clipping routine.

1565
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,700
Yeah, which we use in various places but it only no problem showed up

1566
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,600
it because, you know, I'm this huge set of data that I've got that all

1567
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,300
these different parties.

1568
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,800
You know, hundreds of thousands of queries over time and every

1569
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,700
variation on it right now, I'm pretty much just have this massive test

1570
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,100
database.

1571
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:52,800
Now for a polygon Clipper, right?

1572
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,200
I just just gigantic test and I can split it against like, you know,

1573
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,000
because it's just like this, like, you know,

1574
01:08:59,200 --> 01:08:59,800
no, because I just

1575
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,800
I have this sort of history of the date, I can just go back and forth

1576
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,700
and see exactly what goes wrong and it's not, there's not actually a

1577
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,300
slider, right.

1578
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:13,899
That's mentally because like, but but I do know.

1579
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,100
So I went down this Rabbit Hole of like fixed the Clipper.

1580
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,800
Yeah, we've got to mix the Clipper from.

1581
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,700
I'm going to take a look at the spatial database, right?

1582
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:24,700
But I mean the thing, the thing about it is is just looking at the

1583
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,300
data right there lesson for me here is you know I started out with

1584
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,800
something else, right?

1585
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:29,899
But it's just about

1586
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,899
Realizing the data looking at it and analyze it.

1587
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:34,399
And while I did find out a lot of interesting things about the spatial

1588
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:34,899
database.

1589
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,500
I did also discover things about a completely unrelated system that I

1590
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,200
didn't expect.

1591
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,000
Like, I found ya Liza's in just trying to visualize the data that also

1592
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,399
needed some attention.

1593
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So just the sort of effort of visualizing and just to sort of effort

1594
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,100
of digging into the data.

1595
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,399
Not only end it's helpful to fix, like offline.

1596
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,500
Now, I have this gigantic.

1597
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,100
Yes, you can test again, perfect.

1598
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,600
Test Suite.

1599
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,400
Absolutely insured.

1600
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,700
My turnaround time is like, you know, less than a second to just test

1601
01:09:59,700 --> 01:09:59,800
it.

1602
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,700
This massive database of tests that are all real world scenarios,

1603
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:03,900
right?

1604
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,100
That I just recorded I can get as many as I want.

1605
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,600
Certainly not re bloating the game, the iteration that kind of

1606
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,700
iteration time is just this like and I can do it on my laptop or I can

1607
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,000
do that.

1608
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:12,500
Yeah, thanks.

1609
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,000
Right.

1610
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,300
I like Linux tools.

1611
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,200
I can do it there.

1612
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,600
So super easy to iterate on and I have a much better result, just

1613
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:25,200
because I'm looking at Zeta, and that's for me, like, this is the

1614
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,600
approach that I like to take to probably approach that.

1615
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,800
I find to be useful.

1616
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,100
And it's always surprising, you know, it's it's, there's always

1617
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,500
something that I hit that I didn't expect to hit just because I

1618
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,000
looked.

1619
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:36,500
Yes.

1620
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:42,200
I feel like capture like capture and visualize is kind of like the way

1621
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,200
most hard problems end up getting solved.

1622
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,500
And sometimes problems, you don't even know that you had because until

1623
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:49,600
you actually see the visualization you don't actually realize you

1624
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,100
know, I think finding different ways of looking at the problem.

1625
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:52,200
Yeah.

1626
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,000
Like in terms of your, you know, your eyes, your ears or whatever,

1627
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,300
looking at it is an important part of what we do.

1628
01:10:59,300 --> 01:10:59,800
Like, that's

1629
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,100
We should be spending most of our time and not in the code.

1630
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:03,600
Like, programmers.

1631
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,400
Think that their job is to write typing, like, writing code.

1632
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,800
And that's really not it like, that should be less than 1% of your

1633
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,400
effort, right?

1634
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,500
Is that typing part?

1635
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,400
Which is why I don't want to hear that.

1636
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,900
It took to this, I don't want to do this because it takes too long to

1637
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,600
type like really fucking nobody ever didn't ship again because it took

1638
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,500
too long to type.

1639
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:24,400
It will.

1640
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,200
If you get enough monkey, is that enough typewriters, right?

1641
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,900
Well, I think that's all the time we have.

1642
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,200
Thank you so much for the conversation.

1643
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,700
It's been awesome and that was

1644
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,200
And that was an excellent list as well.
