00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,800
The show Rico to complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,200
We are, yeah, we are probably, you know, mostly done with the

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,600
substantive part of our rendering update to 3D we were previously just

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,700
doing kind of flat 2D rendering and now we actually have full 3d

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:28,500
rendering and yeah, I am not sure exactly what we should be doing

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,800
today but I feel like the right steps because

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,300
Our kind of in a little bit of an amorphous Zone where we kind of want

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,900
to do some cleanup and get a bunch of things back on track that we're

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,700
sort of in limbo.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:46,600
Due to that transition, I would say, probably the most important thing

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:52,600
is now to go make our camera work reliably and our room structure kind

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,700
of work a little bit better.

14
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,400
So I feel like, that's what I'm going to focus on today.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,700
We'll see where it takes us.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,800
Obviously, maybe we end up somewhere else but I think I'd like to do

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,800
Do today is spend an hour or two, just getting the camera room stuff,

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,200
a little bit better straightened out so that it's not a weird kind of

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
hacky system.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,100
It's always been a little hacky back in the 2D day as well.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,500
We never really sat down and made like a really good.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
Here's where your viewing what's going on?

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Similarly like you know, typical thing that might happen in games,

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,700
like this is when you do something like, I don't know.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,900
You flip a switch or something in a door open, somewhere.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,600
There's like a little bit of a cutscene kind of thing where the camera

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
might pan over and focus.

28
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
On it so that you can see that.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,900
That's like it opened the store over here, and then come back, you

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,700
know, stuff like that.

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,200
We would like our camera to be able to handle properly and so, and

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,900
we've never imply anything like that either.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,800
So, just designing a camera system and doing the, you know, the code

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,600
necessary to make all that stuff work.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,200
Cleanly is a pretty worthwhile thing to spend some time on and it's

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
not super complicated like it's not particularly onerous code.

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,700
Once we've sort of done the work, we've already done.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,600
One involving allowing you to set an arbitrary 3D location and view

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,199
the world from it and all that sort of thing, we've already done all

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:08,800
the hard work.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,400
So really all we're talking about now is just having a coherent

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,900
structure.

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,000
That says, what is the camera doing right now?

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,600
Where is it trying to focus?

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,700
You know, does it need to move there?

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Is it far away?

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Is it trying to cut their, or interpolate there?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,700
Just a little bit of, you know, basic AI Logic.

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,900
On top of it, not even admit, it's not real AI, just more.

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,500
Like, just a basic controller.

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,700
Kind

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,100
The thing on top of it is all we're really talking about but it just

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,500
going through the motions of putting that in place and also the notion

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,500
of rooms having that beset coherently and having the camera be able to

55
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,800
think about that coherently.

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,500
So it can say like, okay, I know that I'm supposed to be viewing this

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,900
room or this tile or this, whatever.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,400
I know what that is.

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
In three dimensions.

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
I know how to figure out the place.

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm supposed to view that from.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go ahead and move there.

63
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,400
And I think that's what you want to focus on first when we get that

64
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,900
done, then, I think the other thing we want to do is thing I mentioned

65
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,100
before is just have the ability to knock out things that are in

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,000
between the camera and the player.

67
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,100
So that if the player is, you know, underneath a layer where they're,

68
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,100
you know, on the second floor of, you know, a three-story building or

69
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
something in that third stories in their way.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,600
They, you know, that third story wants to Alpha blend away smoothly

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,900
when they come up to that third

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,400
Story.

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,900
It should blend back in that sort of thing.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,300
I think we want to go ahead and enable in the renderer side of things.

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,400
So I feel like that's kind of where we're at in terms of stuff that

76
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,300
needs to happen.

77
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,200
At that point, I think render clean up and just putting in maybe some

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400
some nice path for stuff like particle systems or things like that.

79
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,200
Just kind of rounding out that field and just making that feel like

80
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
it's a little bit more finished.

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,900
And solid is really, I think the complete package

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
For doing the full 3d upgrade.

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,400
And then I would say, we're basically done with that, and we should

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,200
move on to a different area of work, whatever that turns out to be

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,500
based on what we feel like, so.

86
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,900
Alright, today is day 3, 77.

87
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,800
If I'm not very much an area, let me double check to make sure that

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
that's actually true.

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,899
Yeah, there you go day.

90
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,500
376 is right there.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,300
So, there we go.

92
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
So I'm going to go ahead and open it up.

93
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,300
Day 376 is source.

94
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,800
Code is what

95
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,800
Going to want to start with if you're following along with today's

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
programming at home.

97
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,100
And let's go ahead and just do a quick build and show where we're at.

98
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,400
If I remember correctly, the last thing we did was draw a room

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,100
boundaries.

100
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,700
Let's take a look here.

101
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,800
Okay, go.

102
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,500
And I think we also kind of said, maybe someday we'd work out the mass

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,000
for math for the cross product in a little bit more detail.

104
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm not super motivated to do that today.

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm not interested in doing a lot of math grinding this today, so we

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,600
probably will skip that till a different time since we really don't

107
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:08,800
care.

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,400
Very much about the cross product.

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
In any particular way, at the moment.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,600
Anyway, it's really just for drawing.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,000
These little debug volumes is the only reason we needed it in the

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,600
first place.

113
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,900
So anyway, as you can kind of see where drawing debug volumes now so

114
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,200
we can

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,900
it's nice because now we can actually show stuff like where we think

116
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,900
the rooms are and so what I'd like to do is sort of move into

117
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,700
Basically, like get a little bit more involved in the Collision volume

118
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,300
stuff and maybe set those a little bit more reasonably for example.

119
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,800
Right now, you'll notice what we're doing is we're setting like

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Collision volumes on these trees.

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
I don't really know.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Now at this point what we're doing with Collision volumes but I think

123
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,200
you know what I would say is based on the design of the game we really

124
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,800
don't need Collision volumes for stopping you from moving because

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,200
When you move, you can only move two unoccupied squares, right?

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
And everybody has to stand on squares.

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,900
So really what the Collision volumes are for is for floating objects.

128
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,600
So basically projectiles and things like those creepy floating heads

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,200
that are there.

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,400
I don't know that will actually have any creepy floating heads in the

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:17,600
game.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,000
But, you know, we'll probably have things that are floating that do

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
not necessarily occupy a squares.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,000
And so Collision volumes are really mostly for that purpose, what that

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,700
suggests to me is that we probably don't need anything, really all

136
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,900
that complicated for a collision volumes, a simple, you know, Cube

137
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,200
Ivo.

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,300
Well, not cube right.

139
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,900
Rectangular prism might be the correct word for it, but basically like

140
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,000
a three-dimensional rectangle is probably all we really need for our

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,600
Collision volumes at this point.

142
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,900
I don't know that we need, you know, we did something a little bit

143
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,600
more complicated.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,900
We had a way of you actually specifying a whole series

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
of course, in volumes where you could say, you know, I've got this

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
many different

147
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,700
Rectangles, and so on, we may just want to say that like every entity

148
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,900
has a bounding volume and the bounding volume is, you know, either a

149
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,100
sphere or rectangular whatever and that's just good enough for now

150
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,900
because we don't really have any need for anything complex.

151
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,900
And we're not I don't think going to because like I said, most of what

152
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,100
is actually the important Collision detection that really has to be

153
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:29,000
rigorous in the game is mostly about making sure that players and

154
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Monsters, occupy squares fairly, and that is taken care of with a

155
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,000
different system.

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,900
So given that that's the case.

157
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,400
What I would say is I think we should be able to go in there and

158
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,200
change that around.

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,200
And then from there, what we could do is make sure that our room

160
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,800
Collision volumes are set per room correctly and that'll be easier.

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Once we have in the end of destruct, its bounding volume represented

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,600
directly in in there, right?

163
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,200
So that's all really academic at this point.

164
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,300
I don't know why the find results window ended up down here.

165
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,700
That's just the Mysteries and the magic, the the breathtaking magic of

166
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Windows of Visual Studio.

167
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Let's see if that fixes it.

168
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, that fixes it.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,500
There we go.

170
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,500
I think it's probably cuz we just didn't have a Fine Results before so

171
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,600
it had placed it down there, so let's let's fix that and there we go.

172
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,200
So now I'll go and start doing the thing that I was talking about.

173
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,100
So for starters, let's get room boundaries in there and let's try to

174
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
make those room boundaries work relatively.

175
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,700
Well, if we go into handmade entity then one of the things I think

176
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,200
that we were doing previously that is not particularly great.

177
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Is we have the entity Collision volume group and that's stored off the

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,900
entity as sort of this permanent storage, right?

179
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,400
It's like what happens is we have different Collision groups and they

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
are created at startup basically.

181
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Lee, and those Collision groups.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We say this is you know what the canonical tree has a collision

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,500
volume.

184
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,800
And I don't know that, that's particularly interesting.

185
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,900
Like I said, at the very least we would need scaling on there because

186
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,700
if we didn't scale, those, there's no way to really represent.

187
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,000
The fact that each room has a different Collision Vol volume in terms

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
of the room dimensions, right?

189
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,700
Which is the problem that we're facing at the immediate moment.

190
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,200
And so what interests me, there is just figuring out like, okay, we've

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
got two ways, we could do this either.

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,300
We stick with the a version where we basically have a bunch of static,

193
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,400
Collision volumes, and you're just referencing the one that you

194
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,300
actually need.

195
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,900
And having some kind of a scale value.

196
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:45,100
That tells you what that needs to be, or we just store a simplified

197
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Collision volume directly in the entity.

198
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,400
So for example we can either say here's the scale and we apply this

199
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,500
scale like Collision scale to the Collision volume so that when the

200
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Collision volume represents just a standard size, you know, 1 by 1

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,900
tile by 1 tile by 1 tile room, and it just gets scaled out to fit the

202
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
whole room or something like that.

203
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:08,600
You know.

204
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
We can do it that way or the other way we do it, is we just have a

205
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,900
rectangle 3 in here.

206
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,900
That's like Collision volume, right?

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,200
And these things go away.

208
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,800
So I don't know which of those is the most useful obviously but it

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800
seems like this is the simplest way to go for now and you know it

210
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,300
allows the rectangle to be centered in any way around the entity.

211
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,500
So even if the entities position is, you know, on the ground but it's

212
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,600
a floating thing.

213
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,600
We can represent that because the Collision volume itself has a Min

214
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,300
and Max in all three dimensions, right?

215
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
And so I think that's I just feel like that's probably

216
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,200
What I would want to go with because I feel like this is overbearing

217
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,200
and doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, because I just don't see

218
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,000
us needing it for anything.

219
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Because collisions I feel like are just going to be more

220
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,500
straightforward than that.

221
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,400
Now that may be a naive way to look at it.

222
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm not sure.

223
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,200
But that's just kind of the way it feels at the moment and I feel like

224
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,400
the Collision volume would give us enough tuning to figure out what we

225
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,700
want.

226
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,000
The hit Area to be for our guys and just leave it at that, maybe I'm

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,900
wrong about that.

228
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,700
But you know,

229
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,200
And again, this Collision volume rectangle, three, it gives us a

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
bounding volume.

231
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
We can then set that bounding volume and say, you know, we could have

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,400
a flag that says that, you know, it's cylindrical or spherical or

233
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,900
whatever.

234
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,800
And so, you know, we would have the opportunity to sort of fine-tune

235
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
it to different shapes.

236
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,300
If we wanted to, it doesn't only have to be a rectangle if we then

237
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,300
find that a rectangle for whatever reason, just doesn't fit certain

238
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
entities in a particularly good way, you know.

239
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,600
Some entities are very rounded and want more of that or more

240
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,800
cylindrical, you know, we

241
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Can we can use that.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,100
And so I think I don't know.

243
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,500
That just seems like an easier way to go at the moment.

244
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,900
So I'm thinking maybe we do something like this, and we just let that

245
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,200
change propagate through.

246
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
And I go ahead and I

247
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,700
Go ahead and sort of fix the problems where that would become an

248
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,200
issue.

249
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
So you can see here we've got this entity overlaps, rectangles and

250
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,200
you've got this total volume here and now the total volume is just a

251
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,400
rectangle three anyway if I remember correctly.

252
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,000
So really instead of total volume all we have to do here, I think is

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
past Collision volume.

254
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
That's all that really needs to happen there.

255
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Let's see.

256
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Here are going to from entity Collision volume.

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,200
Wait what?

258
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,300
It's a rectangle three, right?

259
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,200
Cohesion volume.

260
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,700
That's the destination.

261
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,600
That's an Envy.

262
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,300
What does it need to pass?

263
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Their hold on a second.

264
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,600
Let me take a look at entity.

265
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,000
Overlaps rectangle, so that takes an entity Collision volume and we

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,700
don't really want that to take that all we really need to take at this

267
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,600
point is a rectangle three what wasn't a deacon Collision volume.

268
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
I'm interested to know.

269
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,800
Let's take a look here.

270
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,800
Oops.

271
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,600
So it's yeah, it's just another version of rectangle, three right?

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,600
So that was probably just dumb because the moment we don't really need

273
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,100
it.

274
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
I mean, dumbs, probably a wrong word.

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,700
It was just thinking in terms of like, well in the future maybe we'll

276
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,000
mark these up or something, but at the moment.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,100
Yeah.

278
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,300
I don't think I really want to.

279
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,200
Like I said, so we really just get rid of this right and and rebuild.

280
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,300
So now what we would say is that all of these are not necessary

281
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,600
anymore, right?

282
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,800
Those will just get built right into the things that we actually want

283
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,300
them to be and all of this stuff will just be based on.

284
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
Yeah, the rectangle.

285
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,100
And so on.

286
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,500
So let's see.

287
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
When we do the growth here, we have any overlaps rectangle and we have

288
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
the volume and the rectangle.

289
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,700
So this is the end of the volume.

290
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,300
And so, really all we want to do is in this case, we want to know if

291
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,900
these two rectangles overlap, right?

292
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,000
And We're translating this rectangle by this p.

293
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,200
And so I feel like this is stuff.

294
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,900
We should have had in the math Library.

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,800
I don't know why we're doing it by Mankowski in this case, because

296
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,000
it's not really necessary.

297
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
I want to see

298
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,900
So you can see, we've got intersection code here, and we've got

299
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,100
intersection 4 rectangles already.

300
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,400
So if all we want to know, if two rectangles intersect really all we

301
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,200
have to do is call this, right?

302
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,100
And we call the entity volume and the rectangle, and the only

303
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,300
difference that we need here, right?

304
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,800
We can.

305
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,700
Go like this.

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,200
All we really need to do here is we just need to move this editi

307
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,800
volume, so that it's

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Over by however much p is and we already have a way of doing that,

309
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,400
right?

310
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,400
We have offset so we can just say like hey offset this entity volume

311
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,700
by the placement of the entity and then overlap it with this rectangle

312
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,900
and tell us whether or not there was any overlap.

313
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,900
That's all you really need to do there and then we're done.

314
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,700
So again pretty straightforward.

315
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,500
When we do update camera for entity movement, this is a function.

316
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,100
We're going to be redoing, so we don't have to worry too much about

317
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,200
it.

318
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,300
But at the moment what we can do is say well, okay, again we have the

319
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,900
exact same

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,100
Thing, in terms of of, instead of calling isn't rectangle.

321
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,300
We can just again, dude.

322
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:35,700
Editing.

323
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,800
Overlaps rectangle.

324
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,900
We can fact call the exact same thing.

325
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,400
We can say, if and of the overlaps rectangle, right?

326
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,900
And you can see us creating this stuff here in ways that we probably

327
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
don't have to do anymore.

328
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,400
We were sort of working with the fact that our stuff wasn't stored

329
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
kind of nicely and rectangles.

330
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,800
Before, here's the test entity P.

331
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Here's the test entity Collision volume.

332
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,900
And then we just want to know if it overlaps the rectangle for the

333
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,700
room and so the in room volume, let's see.

334
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,500
Here are sorted by petitioner will entity P entity p.

335
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,400
In this case,

336
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,200
I guess this is the tests entity if it is a room.

337
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,500
So the test entity itself, I guessed it yet, the test sanity, we're

338
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,300
just doing entity to entity.

339
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,200
So what we probably should have here is if entities entity

340
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,900
Overlaps entity.

341
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,300
Right?

342
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,800
Is really all we want to say, we want to say, does the entity that

343
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
we're asking about overlap?

344
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,000
The tests entity which is the room potentially, right?

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,700
It's with if we made it through this, if then it's a room and if if so

346
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
then we're done, right?

347
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,500
At that point, we can get the rectangle for the room out at that

348
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,100
point.

349
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,300
And proceed.

350
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,099
So in fact, a lot of this stuff, you know, is probably this room Delta

351
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,800
here, which is the dimension of the room is just the, you know, get

352
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,900
dimension of whatever the Collision volume is, but it's not offset

353
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,400
properly.

354
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
So really room Delta is not the right thing and all of this code is

355
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,000
going to go.

356
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,099
So I'm just going to mark this with like, you know, to do Casey stop

357
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,800
using room Delta.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,400
Start using K controller and that will fix that in large part.

359
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,000
So all we need to do now is augment that entity overlaps rectangle

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,400
call and say, we've also got a similar one which again is just another

361
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
way of calling the rectangle intersection function, but making it easy

362
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,800
on ourselves so that we just can call these and not have to think

363
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,300
about it.

364
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Going to say, hey, do these overlap and it knows to grab the right

365
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,300
things out.

366
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
So again, exactly the same thing

367
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,500
here, it's just a call to ask, whether the

368
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,700
Intersect which we've already implemented.

369
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,200
And so here we just the difference is that we've got to offsets to do,

370
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,900
right?

371
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,300
So we want to know whether a is Collision volume.

372
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,900
Offset it by Ace position.

373
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,600
Intersects B's Collision volume offset by bees physician, right?

374
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,300
That's the only thing we're asking it to do and we've already got all

375
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,700
the code for that basically.

376
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
So let's see here.

377
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
Oops and this is in the wrong order.

378
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,700
There we are.

379
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,200
Oops.

380
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,300
And off we go.

381
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,600
So when we've got entities overlap, that was the function, we were

382
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,600
looking before at and I get, oh, no, I guess we didn't know we had one

383
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:49,900
of these.

384
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,200
This is the one that goes through all of those and this one is just

385
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,800
not necessary anymore, right?

386
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,700
Where is?

387
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,000
So the Epsilon, it looks like it grows these by an Epsilon.

388
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
Does anyone use that Epsilon?

389
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,700
Because we can put that

390
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,800
So nobody uses that Epsilon.

391
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,300
So we don't care about that at all.

392
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,800
That goes away and it's been replaced by the new one that just uses

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
the rectangles and doesn't use this.

394
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
That doesn't use the volumes.

395
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,700
So now let's see what we've got here.

396
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,200
So here is what this is, our move entity call which again probably

397
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
eventually we would replace.

398
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,900
This was the one from a long time ago.

399
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,600
It's just there for moving people, it's looping through these volumes

400
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,200
which doesn't need to do anymore because it only has one volume,

401
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,500
right?

402
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,700
There's only one thing to collide against so there's just one

403
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,200
rectangle.

404
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:47,200
Here, which is going to be the first entity Collision volume.

405
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
We take a look at what we're actually doing here.

406
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
So we've got volume and test volume.

407
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,700
So really that's just, you know,

408
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,500
How are they doing?

409
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,300
They're p-values.

410
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
How are they doing the placement values?

411
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,400
I'm not really sure so there's the relative.

412
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,500
It's got nadp+ volume offset pee test entity P so it looks like they

413
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,000
don't care about the volumes too much I guess.

414
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And then it were testing.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,200
So the interesting thing about this is we have to get the centers of

416
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,200
these I suppose in order to continue having this routine work, the way

417
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,400
it does which is probably fine.

418
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,700
So what I can do here is I can say we've got volume dim and volume

419
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,000
tea.

420
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,100
And this is just going to be we again, we don't need to Loop over the

421
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,500
volumes because we know there's only one entity here, right?

422
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:55,800
And so we just have entity Collision volume and this is a get

423
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Dimension call, which will return us how big it is, and this we can do

424
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,700
it.

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,100
To call to determine where it's centered around and then the rest of

426
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,700
this code should work, we don't have to Loop over the test volumes

427
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
because we know there's only one.

428
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,900
So again we'll have test volume dim, get them test entity, losing

429
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,000
volume, and test volume key.

430
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Get Center test entity, push your body.

431
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,100
So once that's done the rest of this code in theory should just work

432
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,700
and really all we do is we just get rid of the arrow, right.

433
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,600
Because now we've basically derived those values from what we're

434
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,100
storing,

435
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,500
The relative again will do, would do exactly the same thing, I guess.

436
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
It's nadp and test and a teepee.

437
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,900
Oops, don't leave those.

438
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,500
We just need volume pee test volume pee.

439
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,500
Right.

440
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,400
And then all of this again not particularly useful code but at the

441
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,900
moment we might as well leave it standing groups.

442
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,000
Indent please know what's going on.

443
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,300
There we go.

444
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,800
So then

445
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I think we're good and that's about it.

446
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,100
So now when we're drawing these, we knew there's only ever one to

447
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,400
draw, right?

448
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,900
And what we can do is say, you know, if has area, and then go ahead

449
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
and test it, right?

450
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,400
Or rather, go ahead and draw it at that point.

451
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,300
And then we do push volume outline.

452
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,300
All we really need to do is say well, okay, we're going to get a

453
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
rectangle 3.

454
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,600
That's the the draw volume, and that's again, just going to be an

455
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,000
offset.

456
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,700
The Entity Collision volume.

457
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
And the enemy's position.

458
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,800
That's the volume we're going to draw.

459
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,500
And off we go now.

460
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,400
I don't know if we need to do any additional work there in terms of

461
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,000
like the can Collide has area stuff.

462
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,200
There's a little bit, it's a little bit over specified potentially,

463
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
but if we take a look at what happens in here, for example, when we're

464
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,900
doing this can Collide, I'm going to go ahead and say that in can

465
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,100
Collide, we probably also want to do

466
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,000
These are set then we're probably one another check which is like if

467
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,300
has area a collision volume and has area be Collision volume because

468
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,200
if they don't both have closure area then that's not going to happen,

469
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,900
right?

470
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,600
So yeah.

471
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,000
So similarly in here I think we don't have one of those for our 3

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,900
dimensional case.

473
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,400
Move to the more modern type names.

474
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,800
So here's a wreck.

475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,700
Go three.

476
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,500
So in order to have area again the only thing that has to happen here

477
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,200
is it's got to have something, it's got to have a span in every

478
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,900
dimension.

479
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,400
So it just has to have the, it's men be lower than its maximum on all

480
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,100
three bounds.

481
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,400
Instead of just one of those bands.

482
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,900
So, I think we need to change it to this style, because we actually

483
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,800
use vectors in these as opposed to hard code because I think we wrote

484
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,500
it a little later.

485
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,100
So it was.

486
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,200
There we go.

487
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,600
And off we go.

488
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,500
So now let's see in the semicolon stuff here, missing something.

489
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,200
Because your volume.

490
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,300
Yeah, so make simple grounded Collision again.

491
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:52,400
Now these would just be like rectangle, 3, where they are basically

492
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,300
returning.

493
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
Go ahead and modernize these as well.

494
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
I like these new short type names that I switch to.

495
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,600
I should have switched them a long time ago, but I don't know.

496
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,800
I always used to type it out longer

497
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,100
They're nice, they're nice and Tiny anyway.

498
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,200
Let's see, we don't care about this because we don't need to push a

499
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,200
struct into anyone's Arena anymore.

500
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,100
So all we're doing now is just basically doing a rectangle Center gym

501
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,300
so we just do wrecked Center Dim.

502
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,800
This is the center.

503
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
This is the gym.

504
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,100
And that's it.

505
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,400
So now anyone who was doing a simple grounded Collision before, who is

506
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,700
using one of those can just call this function directly and set their

507
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,900
Collision volume using that.

508
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,900
It also means that we don't need the world mode anymore in here which

509
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,200
is nice.

510
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,600
It's just like hey produce me a rectangle that conforms to the

511
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
standard that I was talking about.

512
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,000
So in here when we do begin entity under the Collision equals, null

513
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Collision that again, does not need to happen at all.

514
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,500
All we can in this case just have it be zeros.

515
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,500
So what we can say here is it's a wrecked Center damn or recommend

516
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,000
Max.

517
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Of just all zeros.

518
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,700
And that's a non collider, that's what it would be if it was cleared

519
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,500
to 0 as well.

520
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,100
I don't know if it gets cleared because they're at the minute at the

521
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,400
moment, I don't know if creativity does I should check to see what

522
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
that's supposed to do.

523
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,700
Let me just take a look because it may be that that's redundant.

524
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Clear 20 is a nice feature.

525
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,500
So I may have obeyed it in this case so we zero struct that.

526
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,500
So I think for now let's just say like everything else it just gets

527
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,900
cleared so that's nice things.

528
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,600
Get initialized with a non colliding volume.

529
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,500
Which is good because we want to have to set a volume in order for

530
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,400
them to collide which is nice.

531
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,000
So begin ground, identity.

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,700
In this case again, can just pass rectangle 3 for the Collision

533
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,800
volume, in that case, and then we set that

534
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,600
I am up there it is, and we're done.

535
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,300
And then in all these cases where we would have been passing like

536
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,700
monstar Collision here.

537
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,100
Now, we can go ahead and actually just have these be called in place,

538
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,500
so we can adjust them to whatever we want them to be.

539
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,400
We can, if we want to.

540
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,700
And again, we could just make this a function call.

541
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:26,500
So, if I take a look in here in World mode, monstar Collision, instead

542
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,000
of storing those like we were doing before.

543
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,100
Okay.

544
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,500
So it looks like monstar and familiar and stuff.

545
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Looks like those don't actually have

546
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,200
Visions, so maybe let's just get rid of that.

547
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,400
Because it looks like that's just kind of annoying.

548
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Now, at this point,

549
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,800
Right?

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
And let's go take a look here.

551
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,700
Which ones we actually have.

552
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
So, you can see and hear the only ones we have.

553
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Are these sonal Collision Body Glove monstar and familiar those that

554
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,200
don't exist, right?

555
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,900
So monstar Collision, oops.

556
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Head is in the way mon Star Collision.

557
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,600
Doesn't need to have a collision.

558
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,300
It doesn't have one at the moment, you're a body collision.

559
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,600
Also, does not.

560
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
So the fact that we set that two colliding doesn't make a whole lot of

561
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,600
sense because it doesn't really.

562
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
So I don't know if y That's set that way.

563
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,500
So that's weird.

564
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,900
The hero head Collision is supposed to be there and here it is.

565
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
So we should be able to put that in there and just say make simple

566
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,600
grounded Collision, oops, and that's, you know, just what we had

567
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
passed originally.

568
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,700
So we're literally just doing the exact same thing so I feel like the

569
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,500
body should not have the collides flag set but maybe I'm being dumb

570
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,500
but since we're not colliding it, you can get rid of that.

571
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,000
I also think now I'm not sure why we would necessarily have volumes

572
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,200
and Clyde, I guess, maybe for things like rooms, which may have

573
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,900
volumes, but don't want to collide.

574
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,300
I don't know what to think about that.

575
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,400
A bit more as we get further into the end of the system.

576
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,200
Hero glove Collision doesn't have one at the moment, either.

577
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,800
So that can just go away.

578
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,800
And also this is not passed here anymore, it's just head Collision

579
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,700
volume equals makes it look round of collision.

580
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,400
So that's fine.

581
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,600
Let's take a look.

582
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,700
If anyone else has a monstar collision it looks like a monster does

583
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,600
but monstars shouldn't have any Collision now and so now if we compile

584
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,300
we should get back to ones that actually do have Collision so there's

585
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,200
the familiar.

586
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,300
Let's take a look at what that was familiar Collision.

587
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
Oh no, that's made does not have a collision.

588
00:29:59,500 --> 00:29:59,800
I thought.

589
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It I guess that's why I can pass through things.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,700
So probably should have won but it doesn't at the moment.

591
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,100
So we'll leave it like that until we add one and I guess we would have

592
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,700
to have it be set to colliding there.

593
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,700
All right, so let's see.

594
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,900
We should have a wall Collision somewhere, right?

595
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,700
There's the wall Collision.

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,400
So this wall entity should have a collision volume that Collision

597
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,200
volume should be this.

598
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,900
Nowhere else used it.

599
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,900
None of these were used anymore.

600
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Obviously, that's not used for Collision.

601
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,700
See what's going on there.

602
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,400
So that's a little more complicated that gets used in one place and

603
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,800
it's got a specific kind of volume that's used with it.

604
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,800
We hold off on that one for one second.

605
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,800
Let me see if stare Collision is used.

606
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,100
So, add stair uses it and here's their Collision.

607
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,100
It does use make simple grounded Collision so that can just be entity.

608
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Because I don't think we've got any stares in at the moment.

609
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,100
I don't think we use those anymore but we'll keep it in just 44

610
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Amusement purposes.

611
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
So there we go.

612
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
Collision volume is there.

613
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
That should be it for that.

614
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,600
And then we've just got room Collision which we definitely don't want

615
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
to work this way anymore.

616
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,400
So this one is the one we're going to be changing.

617
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,100
The room coercion volume here is going to have to have a better.

618
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Oh, so here it is.

619
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,100
This is what we need it to do.

620
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,800
So we want to call this here.

621
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,600
There we go.

622
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,600
And that's probably I don't know if that's right or not, but there we

623
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,000
go.

624
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,200
Make simple grounded, coercion.

625
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah.

626
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,400
So to see if that if that looks like it's in the right place.

627
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,000
All right.

628
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,900
So room Collision is not used anymore either.

629
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,500
So now we're just down to floor Collision.

630
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,000
That's the only thing we have left.

631
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,700
So let's take a look at that.

632
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,600
So floor Collision is used here when we're doing the room, creating

633
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,100
the room.

634
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,200
We've got it here.

635
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,800
So it looks like it's still only used in that one place.

636
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
Move out from behind my head there.

637
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,600
There we go.

638
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,900
And so we should be able to fix that pretty well.

639
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,200
Now tile depth in meters here, we've got

640
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,700
Add wall tile depth.

641
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Is down here.

642
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,500
That's typical floor height.

643
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,100
So, let's go ahead and put that in.

644
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,200
Here you go.

645
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,100
Same here.

646
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,800
Oops.

647
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,300
We go and floor Collision.

648
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Again, needs to be done specially.

649
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,800
So, for Collision is here.

650
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,800
Let's grab that out.

651
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,700
And just add that up here, poop.

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,500
Okay.

653
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,100
so, this all goes away and we are left with

654
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,700
that.

655
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,300
We can then use that here.

656
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,500
Oops, I delete.

657
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
What that actually was though.

658
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,600
So, makes it before Collision is just something that makes.

659
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
I guess I don't know what that does.

660
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,600
In fact, I don't know what why does he even have a floor Collision?

661
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,699
Now that I think about it.

662
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,800
I don't even think that's necessary.

663
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Because floors don't collide with anything at the moment.

664
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,199
I think that's actually just meaningless.

665
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,500
All right, let's see that use a semicolon.

666
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,100
Walkable Dimension, that is just the ex-wife, or the gym.

667
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Okay, that's pretty easy.

668
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,900
That's just Collision volume.

669
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Dimensions Hoops.

670
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,100
Which only wants the X and Y there.

671
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm not sure what the walkable dim and walkable height.

672
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,800
Bit is exactly.

673
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,300
Not sure.

674
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,000
What we use those for taxing my memory at this point, but we'll leave

675
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,900
it in for now.

676
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
None of this stuff has to be here anymore.

677
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,000
That's gone.

678
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,500
And we're done.

679
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,700
So now in theory, you know, depending on how much we messed up.

680
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,800
We should have something relatively sane happening, but we probably

681
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,500
missed something up.

682
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,300
Let's take a look.

683
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,300
So here we go.

684
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,700
You can see that we've got a little bit of a busted piece here.

685
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,700
Some, you know, we're getting double translation on the drawing,

686
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,700
right?

687
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
You can see that.

688
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,800
I think that might just be because we're offsetting

689
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
Those volumes and unnecessarily when we draw them.

690
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,200
So it may not really be anything other than that, okay?

691
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,400
Because the entity transform already does the transform by entity P.

692
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,700
So we literally don't need to do anything.

693
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,600
It's literally just that I forgot the in a new transform would already

694
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,400
do that.

695
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,800
So I think that's probably it.

696
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,600
Alright, so now we are back to something relatively sane there.

697
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,400
As far as I can tell.

698
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:07,800
Anyway.

699
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,900
So now let's just figure out how to get our room stuff.

700
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,000
To be showing up a little bit better in terms of volume.

701
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:27,200
So, what I want to do here is I'm going to color these if entity flags

702
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,500
and the D flag collides, I'm going to set it to one color and if not,

703
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,800
I'm gonna set your different color.

704
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm going to say color equals standard color.

705
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,200
but if it collides,

706
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,800
we'll set it to something else.

707
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,900
And this way, I can just see pretty quickly, I'm looking at.

708
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,100
All right?

709
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,800
So pink things are colliding at the moment, purple or blue, things

710
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,500
aren't and now we can see a little more cleanly.

711
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
I think those are our rooms.

712
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,300
So if you look at our rooms right here, you can see that our rooms up

713
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
here to be I think

714
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,100
Right.

715
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,700
I mean, it looks to me, it looks to me like our rooms up here to be

716
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,800
bounded properly.

717
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,500
I mean, for the most part, right.

718
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,300
The only problem that I see with the rooms at the moment is that

719
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,700
they're lined up too high.

720
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,500
So, you know, you imagine what we're going to do with these room

721
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,600
structures, right?

722
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,200
Is we're going to say, okay what room are you in?

723
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,600
You know what I mean?

724
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,300
So we're going to say we're going to try to figure out what room is

725
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,400
the

726
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,400
Hero in.

727
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
So we can move the camera to view that room.

728
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,600
And so if you take a look at what's going to happen here, you know, if

729
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,000
we cut where we're cutting, you can see that line right there is where

730
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,100
this this is that rooms lower boundary.

731
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,700
If I look from the side right, you can see where that boundary is

732
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,000
right there, right?

733
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,900
You see what I'm looking at?

734
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,100
And what you can see is some of the floor tiles for the supper-room

735
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,500
are actually in a place where they're technically, if you were

736
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,600
standing on one, at least the bottom part of the entity would be

737
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,800
outside of the room.

738
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,300
And so, I think what we want to do is bias those downward so that our

739
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,600
notion of where the tiles are for a room that tiles are always up in

740
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,700
their actual room.

741
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,000
And so, for example, what we're doing right now, when we're creating

742
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
these entities in,

743
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,400
World mood, when we do like ad standard room here, which is our little

744
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,400
room test code thing, you can see that we do that the Z value.

745
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,500
So this is the code right here for figuring out like where tile is

746
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
going to be placed inside the room.

747
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,100
And you can see that we have the X and Y are not jittered at the

748
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,800
moment which is fine because we're trying to make it

749
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,400
Wild reconyx saying that looks pretty tiled for the most part you can

750
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,800
see here that we've got the Z value of the Z value is a random

751
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,400
bilateral.

752
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
If you just go up or down by .25 and I think we want to do here is

753
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,900
only go up basically, right?

754
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,100
Like I think what we want to do is say that this is going to be like a

755
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,800
random unilateral only upward and then we'll set it.

756
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,700
So that the Baseline for the room is bull is like the distance down

757
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,900
that that piece is going to be whatever the sort of depth of a

758
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,400
world of a of a Overworld cube is here which is like I guess it's

759
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,000
Point.

760
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,100
5 units down word, right?

761
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,500
I think that's what that is.

762
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,800
So if it's point five units downward, then what that means is we want

763
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
the room itself, right?

764
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,500
To sort of bias, those pieces upwards by that point five.

765
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So I think what we actually want to say here is like, okay, it's 0.5

766
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,200
f, plus whatever that random unilateral is so that everything is OE

767
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,100
skewed upward.

768
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,100
I think that's what we want.

769
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,000
Anyway let's take a quick look at that.

770
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
So here's what that looks like right?

771
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,200
And now

772
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,000
I can see the floor is so much more sane place, right?

773
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,600
So you can see that Flora Line is now all of the tiles for that room

774
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,100
Are Up In what would be technically considered the bounds of the room

775
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,800
and that feels a lot better to me, right?

776
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,900
That seems like a lot more saying, what I will say is we've got an

777
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,100
issue here in terms of our floor height, though, you can kind of tell

778
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,100
that we've got this rather nasty situation where the depth of,

779
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,300
Of a room is pretty tiny, right?

780
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,600
Like I feel like we probably want there to be a quite a quite a bit

781
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,200
more depth to create a bit more space between the rooms basically like

782
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,900
more modern construction.

783
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,200
We want the the 12-foot ceilings not the 8-foot ceilings right when we

784
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,700
hop down here but anyway you know it's as the hero kind of goes down

785
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,000
in here.

786
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,100
So yeah, I feel like we roughly have what we want now in terms.

787
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,000
The room setup.

788
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,700
But again, I feel like we want this Delta, whatever.

789
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,100
This Delta is here to be, you know, to be big to be bigger.

790
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
I feel like it's just too tiny at the moment.

791
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,600
Right?

792
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,500
I also feel like maybe there's not enough variation the tiles now

793
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,300
because before we were going up and down by that, and I think, now we

794
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,600
want to be able to go, you know, because we are going up by .25 or

795
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,200
down by 2.25 at a maximum.

796
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
Then we reduce that to only going upward by .25, that's half the

797
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,100
range, it used to be.

798
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,500
So, I think what we really want to do is more like this to again, get

799
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,400
a little bit more variation.

800
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,800
I just wanted a chunky feeling room just at for a test purposes,

801
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,400
right?

802
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,900
That kind of exaggerated that Delta and I think that's,

803
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,900
A little bit better in terms of what it might be at the at its most

804
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
exaggerated.

805
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Ripe.

806
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,000
And so now we're kind of closing in a little bit on what I want to see

807
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,200
happen here, but I think now we just want to make those dreams a

808
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,800
little bit bigger.

809
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,200
And then we can start to focus on the camera code and doing something

810
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,200
useful with that camera code.

811
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,300
In the meantime, I'm going to since I have allergies, as you know, I

812
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,400
will blow my nose for Anna millionth time today.

813
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:27,800
All right.

814
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:36,500
So that's like, yeah, that's all pretty good and everything is right.

815
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,800
You can see, even this one right here, which is pretty low down, is

816
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,900
right on the Baseline, which is what I want.

817
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
So that all feels pretty good.

818
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,700
These bounds here, look really wrong to me.

819
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,400
So I think our again, we have a bunch of work to do with their

820
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,100
projected rectangle stuff and that stuff has to get fixed.

821
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,300
So that's going to have to get improved at some point, but that's sort

822
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,900
of a separate issue at the moment.

823
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,200
That's the

824
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,300
Emulation bound information stuff some of its right?

825
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,800
Like that's correct.

826
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,800
That looks like the right simulation Bound for the most part but

827
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,900
Yeah, I don't know.

828
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,900
all right, so

829
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,600
I think all I want to do now is just increase that height.

830
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,800
So, if we take a look at what's going on here, you can see our ABS

831
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,000
tile stuff, right?

832
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,600
Basically, what's happening is when we do chunk position from tile

833
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,900
position and that sort of stuff.

834
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,500
I think our problem here is that the tile depth in meters is messed

835
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,000
up.

836
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,200
And so I think we need that chunk Tim and m dot Z to be different than

837
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
what it is, right?

838
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,300
It's

839
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,600
Square at the moment or rather, it wouldn't be square at all at the

840
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,600
moment, but that's fine because I don't think it is.

841
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,000
Anyway, and so the chunk dim and M

842
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,400
You can see typical floor height here.

843
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,000
I feel like typical floor height wants to be very different.

844
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,700
So I feel like, you know, typical fluorite want something else.

845
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,500
I don't know that we're obeying that everywhere really at the moment,

846
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,700
so we might need to do a little work on that.

847
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,200
But if you take a look at what that expands out to now that feels a

848
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,100
little bit better to me game-wise.

849
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,100
You know, maybe that's a little bit too much.

850
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,900
I don't know, you know but if those were floors of a building now, I

851
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,300
just feel like that's a little bit better.

852
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,200
It's not

853
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,900
Realistic.

854
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Certainly, you know I mean you know it if that's the height of a tree,

855
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,400
I don't know that a typical Building height is going to be that much

856
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,100
drastic and maybe I can knock it back a little bit.

857
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,600
Let's say to something else so you know something that's more like

858
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,100
this.

859
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,500
I don't know how how realistic that is is probably not at all

860
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,800
realistic but it feels a little bit better to me in

861
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,600
Terms of the height difference between rooms, maybe I'll knock it

862
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,000
back, one more, I don't know.

863
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,500
But it needed to be at least that that much.

864
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,000
The other thing that I think would be interesting.

865
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,800
So for example, you notice we've got this problem here, right?

866
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,400
And I don't know that there's much we can do about it, just directly

867
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,200
where you've got when the hero kind of comes up upstairs.

868
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,600
You can imagine what's going to happen here.

869
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,900
He's going to clip through this geometry.

870
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,300
If he's, if he's relatively tall, we can tune it.

871
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,800
So maybe he doesn't as much.

872
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,500
You saw his head clip through there.

873
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,000
I wish these familiars would leave me alone.

874
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,200
Hey guys, could you, could you not could you just not

875
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Everyone's blocking me.

876
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,700
Okay, there we go.

877
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,700
So when I come down here, right, can see me hopping down.

878
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,600
You can see that we poked through there and, and the circumstance.

879
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,100
What we're looking at here, right?

880
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:58,500
Is the hero standing on on this, this plate right here but that Z bias

881
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,600
that we have in there makes and poke through rather than than not.

882
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,600
And you know, it might be that that Z bias is just too high at the

883
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,700
moment and that just getting rid of the Z bias would get rid of it.

884
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,600
But we don't

885
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,900
No, what would happen.

886
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900
There it also is probably the case that the hero is too big for this

887
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,000
queries on because he's actually if you take a look at him he actually

888
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
kind of extends a little bit more.

889
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,400
He extends too far to the side to even be on a single Square so you

890
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,000
can see like he extends further outside the bounds of the square.

891
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,200
So really probably part of it is that the hero probably needs to be a

892
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,100
little bit smaller or perhaps the other way to look at it.

893
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,500
The tiles need to be.

894
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
A little bit bigger.

895
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,300
And let me take a look at that here tile side.

896
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,400
M, for example, you know, it may be that tile side and meter is kind

897
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,200
of needs to be expanded out, you know.

898
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,800
Maybe they that needs to be more like this or maybe it just needs to

899
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,400
be that the hero needs to be shrunk.

900
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,700
Right?

901
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,200
But it feels like that would be a little bit better.

902
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,100
And again, the tiles themselves, I guess have to kind of be why our,

903
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
why didn't we make those proportional?

904
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:11,900
I don't know why.

905
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,700
That's a good question.

906
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,500
Also, don't know why nobody's able to actually hop at this point we

907
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,900
must be using that as some kind of a search distance, that's hard

908
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,200
coded, we have to get rid of a lot of that hard coating, which will do

909
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,700
as we when we do the game code.

910
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,500
So it's not no big deal but so if they were further spaced out that I

911
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,300
think we'd have less of a problem here as well.

912
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,900
Because again, you know, the hero would not protrude into it so much

913
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,400
as he would at the moment.

914
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,500
So that might be better but I think possibly the right thing to do

915
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,600
there because I don't know.

916
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,800
the think about it, I think we want the tile side to be what it was at

917
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,000
the moment and we just want the hero to be a little bit less poofy,

918
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,400
you know, maybe shrink them down a little

919
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,800
So, let's see.

920
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Let's go to entity here or right.

921
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,300
That would be an ad piece actually.

922
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,700
So it's you had hero when we construct the hero.

923
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,200
This hero, isn't it?

924
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,000
At player not out here.

925
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,400
Inside here, you know, if we, if we sort of tone down the size of the

926
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,400
here, a little bit, see what that maybe is more reasonable in terms of

927
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:25,700
width.

928
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,300
At least, now he fits inside a square, which is a plus, right?

929
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,200
And so when it comes down here, that looks about right when it comes

930
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,100
down here, you can see like you kind of swell of course the camera

931
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,400
moved as well in this case.

932
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,100
So it's hard to say exactly if it was back a little bit but still it's

933
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,500
going going to go through there and then when it's get down here, it's

934
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,000
out.

935
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So it's really only that.

936
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,800
Stare that that second stair but I don't know.

937
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,700
We'll see what happens.

938
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,400
Point being what I was going to say there is we have an option of

939
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,800
fixing that by actually sort of working around that problem, even in

940
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,500
the case for the heroes large, we can work around that problem by

941
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:12,900
actually having the camera help us because if the camera moved over to

942
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,900
where the stairwell was when you went downstairs, then

943
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,900
Then you would end up in a circumstance where it would be straight on

944
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,500
to you and you would not get that overlap, right?

945
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,100
So, that's another option.

946
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,900
For example, if we imagined in at standard room,

947
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,000
If we imagine that we were already in line with the stairwell, which

948
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,600
would be what world position P left.

949
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,700
Hold down to floor below.

950
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,600
Here is okay, so we go right whole this part right here.

951
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,400
If we were to set off set X to Zero instead of three.

952
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,700
So the stairwell was right in the middle of the view, then you don't

953
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,300
get that problem, right?

954
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,400
So you can kind of see how if it lines up with the camera.

955
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,000
Course that is if I can get these guys out of my way, I should turn

956
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,300
them off.

957
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,700
They're really annoying.

958
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:11,300
These sausage gentleman sasi, bodiless disembodied, heads.

959
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,500
So, if I come down here now, who is in my way, why can't I jump down

960
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:18,800
there?

961
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,500
Somebody's in my way, but not sure why.

962
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,000
Or maybe it's just that, that stairwells too high for sorry, for some

963
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,500
reason now.

964
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,800
I'm not sure why.

965
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,900
The difficulties of illustrating things, when you haven't finished,

966
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:37,400
the actual game code at all, and all these heads are flying up towards

967
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,100
me, it's kind of creepy.

968
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,200
There we go.

969
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,300
So when I hop down these you can see now there's no problem with

970
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,300
interpenetrating because you know, just because of where the camera

971
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,100
is, right.

972
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,200
It doesn't, it doesn't have the same problem.

973
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,500
And so what we could do is just force the camera to align to move over

974
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,300
to where you are.

975
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,200
When you go down a stairwell,

976
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,800
L would

977
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,800
Another problem would be another way to avoid having that Graphics

978
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,900
artifact because there's nothing we can really do about it.

979
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,800
Like I said it's just an artifact of trying to do some 2D you know

980
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,100
stuff in 3D.

981
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,000
We're making these sort of hacks to allow you to do some stuff that

982
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,400
you wouldn't normally be able to do with the 2D art to make it appear.

983
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,700
Like it situated in a 3D World kind of nicely.

984
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,200
And at that point it's just like well you know you're going to run up

985
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,900
against certain places where it's unclear if there's really any way to

986
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,800
hack it to make it not have an artifact.

987
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But sometimes what you can do is just like make it so that case

988
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,500
doesn't happen, right?

989
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,900
So all we really have to do.

990
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,100
There is go like okay, can we do something where

991
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,300
Where will force the camera to compensate for that fact and, and make

992
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,200
it not cause a problem.

993
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,500
So anyway, looking at this, this looks a little bit more right to me.

994
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,000
Now, I feel like that gives us enough space here between floors to

995
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
make it feel relatively, right.

996
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:01,500
Again, they're much larger than floors would be and say a building,

997
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,200
probably in reality.

998
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,600
But I just kind of feel like gamey for gaming purposes.

999
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,500
You want there to be a lot of room there and

1000
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,200
The dungeon wants to kind of feel deep like when you're going down

1001
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,100
that there that's quite a bit below, you were something like this so I

1002
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,100
feel like that's a little bit more, right?

1003
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,500
All right, so that's really all we need to do with the Collision of

1004
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:33,700
volumes and we still got about 45 minutes left.

1005
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,200
So all we should really have to do now is move over to working on the

1006
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,400
camera, which I don't know if we'll finish today, but I feel like that

1007
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,100
was all we really can.

1008
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,000
Do need to do with the question firemen out there simplified and clear

1009
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,000
what they actually are.

1010
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,500
So let's take a look at the camera code at the moment and just see

1011
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,000
what's going

1012
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,600
And with it.

1013
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,500
So I believe we have in here.

1014
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,500
So yeah you can see this this here it's this is a note.

1015
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,700
It is mandatory that the camera Center be the same region Center for

1016
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,300
this code to work properly because it can I add the offset from the

1017
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,700
Sim Center to the camera as a displacement or it will fail when moving

1018
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:26,300
between rooms at the changeover point that changeover Point problem I

1019
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,800
think is also something that we can avoid here because the camera now

1020
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,100
update camera for entity movement what we can do is

1021
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:40,400
Probably make the camera be an actual entity with an actual brain that

1022
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
updates itself.

1023
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,200
As part of the world update, I feel like that probably would just

1024
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,700
work, right?

1025
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,800
At least, it seems like it.

1026
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,400
Now, maybe it's better to keep it separate because that means we can

1027
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,700
run it guaranteed Lee after the person moves.

1028
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,300
But anyway, so here is the code that we were using before it which

1029
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:14,000
seems pretty reasonable where we say.

1030
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,200
Okay, any room entity.

1031
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,800
Let's see if the players in it so that way we know which room the

1032
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,900
players actually in, right?

1033
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,500
And that's pretty straightforward.

1034
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,000
Let's get rid of room, Delta.

1035
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,900
And let's let's just use in room, right?

1036
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,500
Because the other thing is come from there in pretty much entirely.

1037
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,200
Right?

1038
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,500
If we wanted to, we could actually do these outside by just saying,

1039
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,100
you know, whatever it's it's in room pee.

1040
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,300
Right?

1041
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
So you just get rid of these.

1042
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:11,200
So now if we know that this is the room that we're trying to view and

1043
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,100
we know where that room is, then all we need to do is say, well, I'm

1044
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,300
trying to move toward that room.

1045
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,700
Right?

1046
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,900
I need to move in the direction of that room and I'm trying to member

1047
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,700
if this to do is still apply Center to be Sim Region Center,

1048
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,500
So yeah, I think this can go away.

1049
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,900
If we just stop thinking of that room, Delta as a thing and just have

1050
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,700
the camera, be the camera without any displacement because I don't

1051
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,600
think we need that for anything in particular.

1052
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,500
I'm trying to think if we do, but I don't think we do.

1053
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,200
It's an interesting question.

1054
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,700
Let's proceed, a little further and find out.

1055
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,700
Anyway, so we've got which room we're in at the moment and so we know

1056
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,800
where we would want to be in terms of where the camera should be.

1057
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,100
And then we know where the camera is right, we know both of these two

1058
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,600
things.

1059
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,900
So, essentially, what we would say is like, okay,

1060
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,400
What we want to do here is track the world space position of the

1061
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,000
camera through the entire system.

1062
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,000
So again, it seems like we want the camera to be in the Sim in the

1063
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,300
simulation itself properly, right?

1064
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:49,200
We want the camera to have a better notion to unpack itself relative

1065
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,900
to the the Sim region.

1066
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,300
And I think is that what we're doing here?

1067
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:55,900
No.

1068
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,400
So what I want to do, I guess what I'm saying is

1069
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,900
We have the cameras.

1070
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,800
Hold position and I think we want to do is unpack it into the Sim

1071
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,500
region, then update it as if it's an entity and then pack it back and

1072
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,100
return, that I think that's what we actually want.

1073
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,500
So let's go ahead and try to make that work in the same fashion.

1074
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,600
All right, so if this is the room that we're in, we should be able to

1075
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,000
compute essentially what I wanted what I want to compute here.

1076
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,200
Is, you know, I've got a rectangle.

1077
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,800
That represents the room.

1078
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:38,500
Right?

1079
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,800
And if I've got a rectangle that represents the room and I want to

1080
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,800
view it, I should be able to come up with.

1081
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,800
I've got to put my little day heading in days 377.

1082
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
At this point, what I should be able to do is say, what is the camera

1083
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,700
location that would most.

1084
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,200
That would be where I would want to view this room, right?

1085
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,400
And I should be able to come up with a Target position for the camera.

1086
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,000
Right?

1087
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,800
So if I have a Target position for the camera, then I would know.

1088
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,200
Okay?

1089
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:18,800
This is where I need to view the room from and once I know where to

1090
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,400
view the room from, I should be able to take my current camera

1091
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,300
position wherever it is and drive it toward that location.

1092
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,000
And that way it gets me out of this whole situation that I'm looking

1093
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,900
at here with the whole like, you know, problem of room apron clamped

1094
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,400
map to

1095
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,300
Is Bounce height, blah blah blah blah, right.

1096
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,400
I should be able to make a thing.

1097
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,000
That just kind of nicely goes between one room and another room as

1098
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,700
part of the camera interpolation or whatever has to happen.

1099
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,300
And if we go right,

1100
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:58,200
Okay, so what I want to do here is construct that here is the two

1101
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
values ice cream before hand.

1102
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,500
But I don't know, they really care what those that much at the moment.

1103
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,100
What I really want to know is where is the room, right?

1104
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,500
And what is that rectangle?

1105
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,400
So what I want to do is I want to take the room volume that I'm

1106
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,300
viewing and I can get that bite again, just doing an offset by saying

1107
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,400
whatever the in room placement is of the in room Collision volume.

1108
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,400
That's the room that I'm trying to look at, right?

1109
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:22,700
Like that's

1110
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,000
What?

1111
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm trying to view at the moment and so then what I want to do is say,

1112
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,500
well, the camera should probably be centered around that.

1113
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,300
So the camera or the target position should probably be whatever the

1114
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,300
center is of that room volume.

1115
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,800
At least the X and Y of that, right?

1116
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:46,500
And then I want to be up some distance from that center.

1117
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,800
Now it's the ground.

1118
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,000
It's the floor that I usually look at a rooms, so really, we probably

1119
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,800
want to say.

1120
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:58,000
It's something more like the center of the room volumes X and Y, but

1121
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,800
it's probably the room values.

1122
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,800
Minimum Z that were looking at, right?

1123
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,000
And then, what I want to do is I want to offset that by however, far.

1124
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,300
I want the camera above that room.

1125
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,100
So the target pz values would probably be increased by whatever.

1126
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,800
I don't know, however, much I want here.

1127
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,600
I'm gonna, you know, think about what I want that to be and probably

1128
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,700
base it on the size of the room as well, so that I can frame the rooms

1129
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,300
nicely.

1130
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,700
Then I'm going to get rid of all this this

1131
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,300
Was going to say crap, but let's say wonderful code.

1132
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,000
Entirely in and all of this stuff will going to get rid of for now.

1133
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,400
So, let's just get rid of all of this, right?

1134
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:48,800
And yeah, let's just just say and in Room camera height can go away

1135
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,500
now as well.

1136
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,300
Because we'll just do that automatically for now.

1137
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,300
And so, what we need to do now is first, let's start by just snapping

1138
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,700
the camera directly to that location, right?

1139
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:11,200
So here's the region origin.

1140
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,300
Here's the room.

1141
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,700
Campy that's going to be that Target pee.

1142
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,100
We don't care about this at all, or wait.

1143
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,500
So camera has a separate offset.

1144
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:33,200
Which we shouldn't need any more really so I don't really want that

1145
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,900
probably anymore.

1146
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:42,900
Probably just want to do some other stuff with that separately.

1147
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,900
Let me take a look at that.

1148
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:57,500
So you can see here, we've got this offset here, that gets applied to

1149
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,200
things and I don't know that.

1150
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,000
I really want that in there anymore.

1151
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,900
Let me go ahead and set it to zero at the moment, but

1152
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,500
But we can come back and visit revisit that in a second.

1153
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,200
So here we are doing whatever it is.

1154
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,300
We're doing hopping around having fun now for whatever reason.

1155
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,000
Oh, because the cameras.

1156
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
Yeah, so this is the part where private to take a look at like I was

1157
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,300
suggesting but that's okay.

1158
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,500
so you can kind of see we the problem that we have at the moment is

1159
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,100
that

1160
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:48,900
If we want to move to considering the cameras location to being actual

1161
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,100
physical location in the world, which is what I would like, what we

1162
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:57,100
then need to do is have a way for the camera to articulate to the game

1163
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,800
where it's actually trying to view.

1164
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,600
Right.

1165
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:07,700
And that is what would tell us what the Sim region should be right.

1166
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,700
So what we want, here is something that's like when we go in and do

1167
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,700
update camera for entity Movement.

1168
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,700
We know this is the room that we're in.

1169
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:21,300
We want to basically say here is the simulation region room center,

1170
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,700
right?

1171
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,500
This is where you should be centering that about.

1172
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,100
So we want something like, you know, Simulation Center.

1173
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:34,300
And that should be like that and we would say, then okay, the target p

1174
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,200
is the Simulation Center plus that 8 or something like that, right?

1175
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,300
And then what we can do is instead of having this offset, I can say

1176
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,300
that the camera Simulation Center is going to be equal to that

1177
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,200
Simulation Center.

1178
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,500
And the camera p is going to be something entirely different, right?

1179
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,600
Like so and so if we go ahead and do something like this, I think

1180
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,700
that's a little bit better.

1181
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,400
That Simulation Center bit.

1182
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,400
Now allows me to say like okay there's a world position P.

1183
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,300
There's a world position, Simulation Center.

1184
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,600
And then we get rid of the offset.

1185
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,000
I think that might do the trick.

1186
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,100
So now camera offset is not going to be anything by default.

1187
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:25,300
Buster screen, shake or something going on.

1188
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,500
That's good.

1189
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,900
And what we need to do now is say, well, okay, you know, we're doing

1190
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,200
this thing where we're saying, the world camera record is get Wrangle

1191
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,700
rectangle, at Target render group.

1192
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,400
We don't really, I think want to do that anymore and I don't the

1193
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,200
screen bound stuff.

1194
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,100
We probably maybe, you know, might be something we actually want to

1195
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:53,200
do, but at the moment that's not this, this stuff is not what we want.

1196
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,500
We want to do something smarter here.

1197
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:59,500
So when we have our Sim bounds and we do this, this sort of nonsense,

1198
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,100
We need to do this a little bit smarter.

1199
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:06,500
Here we need to do this this more reasonably and in fact what we could

1200
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:12,800
do is actually just or what that rooms worth of size is as well, we

1201
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,200
could have sort of something that uses that and so maybe we want to

1202
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,400
store that as well at the moment I won't do that just yet.

1203
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,200
But what I would like to do is say alright.

1204
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,700
So

1205
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,800
Let's take this world camera wrecked situation and let's get.

1206
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,600
This is all just this is just garbage.

1207
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,600
We don't really want to do it this way at all, but what we want to do

1208
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,900
here say okay, let's figure out where in the where in the world this

1209
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:39,800
is going to

1210
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,900
The simulation region should start, which is coming from the camera,

1211
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,200
which is telling us where the Simulation Center should be.

1212
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:52,300
So when we do this, we're saying okay, here is the, the camera P.

1213
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,500
This is where I want you to lay around.

1214
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,000
We don't want to do that anymore.

1215
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,900
Right, what we want to say instead is here is well, I guess I still

1216
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,200
That here is the Simulation Center that the camera wants which may not

1217
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,700
be necessarily where the camera itself is, right?

1218
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,600
We don't want the simulation necessary, we send around the camera

1219
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,200
because the camera might be moving around.

1220
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
We want the

1221
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,000
the ability to specify here is where we're simulating in.

1222
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
The camera is some are slightly different from that potentially

1223
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,900
perhaps quite a bit different from that depending on the

1224
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:24,700
circumstances.

1225
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:28,400
So that's where we're trying to simulate and

1226
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,800
And then we just need to know how big of an area.

1227
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:35,300
We're trying to simulate at the moment again.

1228
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,100
I'm not sure we want that to really be based on any of the things that

1229
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,300
we're talking about here.

1230
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:45,300
Probably what we want instead, instead of that is something, you know.

1231
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,100
We probably want something.

1232
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:53,700
for rec center gym, that's literally just

1233
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,300
This sort of thing.

1234
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,200
And I don't know that we even want any of that other stuff at all at

1235
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:07,900
the moment.

1236
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Alright, that's, let's take a look at what we get here.

1237
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:14,300
Of course.

1238
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,500
Now I, we also need some way of initializing that Simulation Center.

1239
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,900
So now we've got all of them set.

1240
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,800
So the Simulation Center will actually be initialized to something

1241
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,300
which is good.

1242
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,100
And so now we just need to fix the one more fact which is that the

1243
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:56,800
debug offset stuff at the moment appears to be initialized to zero in

1244
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,200
a bad way so we're going to have to fix that as well but other than

1245
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,300
that, I think we're good to go.

1246
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,500
All right, so one last thing, let's go ahead and get that.

1247
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,300
So we've got the Simulation Center.

1248
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,800
Initialized.

1249
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,400
We've got the last p and p initialized, but those will we don't really

1250
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,399
need to initialize those for the most part because they should get set

1251
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,899
automatically at some point.

1252
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,300
I don't know where the player is.

1253
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:23,399
Do we know where we add a, where do we add the player?

1254
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,600
And I don't really know.

1255
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,200
So we add the player wherever the same region.

1256
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:39,899
Currently is the closest reversible 2000 so that should be ok.

1257
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:42,700
Probably anyway.

1258
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,200
So I want to take a look at that that initialization of the camera

1259
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,500
offset because we get some problems, the debug camera, where were

1260
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,700
using debug camera, we need their the debug camera Dolly to be

1261
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,899
something reasonable.

1262
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,700
Which at the moment, it isn't.

1263
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
So let's take a look at that, David Cameron.

1264
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,100
Ali.

1265
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,200
So the part that's weird.

1266
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,000
So here's the thing that ends up happening.

1267
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:24,399
So at the start because debug camera dolly is 0, we end up with this

1268
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:29,700
problem of the camera can zoom in and out because there's no known

1269
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:30,800
Focus point to it.

1270
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,899
So what we need is we need a way of talking about how far you are away

1271
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:38,300
from the Simulation Center, which is a separate thing, right?

1272
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:43,300
So we really want this distance here, this camera Dolly distance and

1273
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,000
also the

1274
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,700
We were rotating around like the pitch in that sort of stuff.

1275
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,899
Also needs to be respective of what that Center Point is.

1276
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,400
So when we're constructing, the debug camera, we kind of need to look

1277
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,300
at where that point is.

1278
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,900
Because now we just have a camera position and we don't have an offset

1279
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,800
from that position.

1280
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,400
We just have a camera that's like, sort of floating around.

1281
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,300
It doesn't have that sort of construction of.

1282
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,000
Here's the center point, and we're back a certain distance from it,

1283
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,700
because we got rid of the offset, which I think we want to do.

1284
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
I don't think we really want an offset on there.

1285
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,400
I don't know.

1286
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,100
I don't think about whether we should,

1287
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,200
Should keep it that way.

1288
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
We're, we're, it's got to pull back.

1289
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,000
That's that it knows about

1290
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,700
I'm trying to think of whether I like that or not.

1291
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,900
Because on the one hand it's much nicer.

1292
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,700
If you're just thinking about the cameras, always having a particular

1293
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,500
position in the world and you could just treat it like an entity.

1294
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,000
It's like, here's where the camera is.

1295
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,600
It's this entity in the world.

1296
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,500
It floats around does what it wants to do.

1297
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,800
But on the other hand, it's also nice to be able to say well okay, the

1298
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,300
cameras focal point is the entity.

1299
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:02,000
So wherever we're looking at is the entity, you know, and the offset

1300
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,200
from there is just how we're sort of orbit viewing that.

1301
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,400
Whatever that is

1302
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,300
So it's really difficult for me to really say which of those.

1303
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,200
I feel like

1304
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,600
it's more appropriate so I don't know.

1305
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:26,300
Maybe I do like the idea of just an offset Z there and I just don't

1306
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,900
want that to be the thing that we animate.

1307
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,400
So I do want the cameras position to move in the world for its focus

1308
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,000
point.

1309
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,900
I don't want it to laterally displace X and Y but maybe, I do want a

1310
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:42,900
distance, displacement on the camera as a separate control so that the

1311
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,800
camera itself is its focus.

1312
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,600
Is the entity position of the camera, essentially.

1313
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,600
So that's the question and I don't know the answer to that question.

1314
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,600
That's that's one.

1315
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,600
That's like I feel like it's one of those six, six of one half-dozen

1316
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,000
of the other that whichever one you pick.

1317
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,300
There's going to be some difficulties.

1318
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,000
You're going to encounter with the way you chose to do it and there

1319
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,700
isn't one particularly right way.

1320
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:31,900
So I feel like either or I guess at the moment at the movement what is

1321
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,600
happens with camera offset here?

1322
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,400
So, I mean, I guess what I could do is say, all right, if that was the

1323
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,100
case.

1324
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:51,000
I could still choose to do that.

1325
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,200
I'm just really not sure about it, but if I did that,

1326
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,500
it would look like this, and

1327
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,000
I guess technically it's redundant to say camera since it's in the

1328
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,700
cameras direct we all kind of know that and then what we would do is

1329
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:21,200
say yeah okay so when we update the camera position, we would say oh

1330
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:28,100
hey by the way the camera Target Z is whatever we compute that to be.

1331
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,200
Sorry offsets.

1332
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,100
And then that part would work properly I think yeah it's because then

1333
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:48,600
we would still be focused on the part that we're focused on which is

1334
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:53,600
probably good and the other thing that we can do there is now it's

1335
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,200
pretty trivial I guess to say whether we want a locked camera or not.

1336
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,300
So like for example if we want to lock the camera to the players

1337
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:06,400
location, we can also do that pretty easily because we can say like

1338
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,700
okay yeah, if we want

1339
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,600
To make the target, PB The Entity P, for whatever reason we just can.

1340
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,500
And then we end up with getting back to a scrolling mode in theory, or

1341
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,200
maybe not.

1342
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,400
That's supposed to set the camera p.

1343
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,100
Did I miss something?

1344
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,100
Do we not use our okay?

1345
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,000
We don't use the camera.

1346
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,100
We don't actually take into account the difference between the two of

1347
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:53,600
those.

1348
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,400
Placements.

1349
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:56,900
Do we?

1350
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,800
So we didn't really write this code.

1351
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,500
When we set up the camera, we just assume that the Simulation Center

1352
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,700
is at the center of the projection as well, which is not true.

1353
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,700
So, what we really want here, when we create the view for the world.

1354
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:20,000
So we create the orientation, we create the translation, you can see

1355
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,100
it happening here.

1356
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:28,200
This camera offset actually wants to be more to also have the Delta

1357
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:29,800
Delta

1358
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,800
From SIM, right?

1359
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:34,900
And so we want to have a thing there, which says, we have to put the

1360
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,500
simulation where the simulation should be relative to the camera

1361
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,100
Center.

1362
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:43,500
So we need something like, what is that in the world?

1363
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,000
We've got that call.

1364
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,300
That gets the difference between two things, right?

1365
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,600
It's like a subtract call.

1366
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,100
Here it is.

1367
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,800
so in this case, we want to say, like, okay, take the worlds,

1368
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:03,400
And I want you to subtract the cameras.

1369
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,700
Which one is it?

1370
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,500
That.

1371
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:18,700
Again, I want you to take the cameras position and the simulation

1372
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,200
region.

1373
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:25,400
And of course, this is the way we're going to be translating the world

1374
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:30,300
and it looks like, so the way that we've written, this here is the

1375
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:32,800
camera offset plus the camera Dolly.

1376
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,600
So we're actually talking about where we're placing the camera, and

1377
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,300
then we're creating a camera transform from it, which means, we're

1378
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,600
inverting this value, right?

1379
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:43,500
These are

1380
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,100
The Columns, these are the axes and the

1381
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,300
placement of the actual camera.

1382
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:56,000
So what we want to do here is say well the camera is at this location

1383
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,700
relative to the world and then we're inverting that to place the

1384
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,200
world.

1385
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:07,400
So I believe we want to say tell us the Delta between the Simulation

1386
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:11,200
Center and the cameras location.

1387
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,600
That's the Delta that has to get applied in here and off you go.

1388
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,300
So

1389
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,500
These have to be addresses of.

1390
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,500
Then I think that should be correct.

1391
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,800
Or not.

1392
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,300
What am I missing here?

1393
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,200
That.

1394
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,600
Is probably bad.

1395
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,600
Code that never gets run, does not have an effect on your game.

1396
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:47,700
That's just something you should probably be aware of in your actual

1397
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,100
life.

1398
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,700
So anyway, so now we have the ability to scroll a room too.

1399
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:58,800
And what's worth noting here is now we can scroll the room which we

1400
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
may want to, do you

1401
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,600
For large rooms or something, who knows, essentially for free there

1402
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,800
because we can just turn that on and off.

1403
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,500
And if we ever want to turn it off, right, we just can

1404
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,000
And it will snap back and we can make a gradual snapping back of it

1405
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,300
right?

1406
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,200
If we want to.

1407
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,300
And now that's just a lot cleaner because of the simulation region is

1408
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,800
not thinking about where the person is there.

1409
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:29,700
Just think about what room they're in which is really all we actually

1410
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,500
want there.

1411
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,800
So I feel like that's kind of good.

1412
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,800
I also feel like maybe that we could again experiment with turning

1413
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,800
that on and off.

1414
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,400
So one example like I said,

1415
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,800
If we wanted to pull the camera in line with the player when it get

1416
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,000
when the player gets to something like a stairwell so that it's kind

1417
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,700
of in line with the stairwell.

1418
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,000
We could like tag certain traversable as or something like that.

1419
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,300
Where it's like, hey, if the player is on here, do this thing or

1420
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,600
another thing is like, hey, here is a region that if the player is in

1421
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,700
I need you to, like, pay attention to something that's happening.

1422
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,200
I don't know.

1423
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,500
Right.

1424
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:15,200
So what I'm thinking there is like, let's say, you know,

1425
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:21,200
I don't know if we're over loading, this brain thing a little bit

1426
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:21,500
much.

1427
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,700
I think we probably are.

1428
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,600
But if you imagine doing something here, where we're testing these

1429
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,100
entity overlaps, right?

1430
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,200
Well we could do is test the another overlap as well.

1431
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,300
Which is to say, let's take a look and see if you're in any other

1432
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,400
regions that have special overriding camera concerns that are

1433
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,400
different than the room concerns.

1434
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,600
So we could have like you know what room you're in and then like you

1435
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,000
know, special camera.

1436
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,300
Or something.

1437
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,400
And so we could detect if you're in the special camera region.

1438
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,700
And if you're in the special camera region, we could do something

1439
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,900
special right?

1440
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,900
And for the moment, I'll just do a thing where we'll say for in the

1441
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,800
special camera region, then we'll do the the, you know, the switch to

1442
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,900
the entity mode, or something like that, just to show how that would

1443
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:08,100
work.

1444
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,800
But then we'll do something, you know, a little bit better in terms of

1445
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,600
like detecting the camera a little bit more.

1446
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,400
I also for the moment, might go ahead and switch us to optimized build

1447
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,800
so that we get a better frame rate.

1448
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:20,000
So we

1449
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:26,500
60 frames a second for testing, right just so we can see you know it's

1450
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,200
easier to test something like a camera when you're zipping along in a

1451
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:31,800
nice way.

1452
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:35,400
So you know, here's the current state and what I'll try to do here is

1453
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,000
just make something that's like, okay, let's say that when we hop to

1454
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,800
hear something and go down the stairs or start going down the stairs,

1455
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:47,000
it'll switch the view to something that like, lets us see that a

1456
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,100
little bit more easily or I don't know, something like this.

1457
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,300
Not sure this is something we actually want in the game but just just

1458
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,200
showing like how to start making the camera.

1459
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,200
Be a little bit more flexible in that sense.

1460
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,700
So if we make something like an energy here,

1461
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:06,300
And you know, maybe I'm a Canada flag or something to this to this

1462
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:11,200
extent, which I think is how I probably should have done the rooms as

1463
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:11,500
well.

1464
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:16,200
I don't know that they wanted to be a brain per se that seems like a

1465
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,600
bad idea, but, you know, we'll sort of start to clean this stuff up as

1466
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,100
we get a little further down the road, anyway,

1467
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:35,700
If we have something like this in here, I could do something like, you

1468
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,500
know, like this.

1469
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:56,500
So that we can detect things that are going to be, you know, relevant

1470
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:56,700
there.

1471
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:57,800
We don't need that code anymore.

1472
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:58,400
That's not there.

1473
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,200
So now we can create volumes that that control the camera in some way.

1474
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:02,700
Right.

1475
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:07,500
And so the way that we would do that is in handmade entity.

1476
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,800
I'm sorry and handmade World mode when we're creating it, you know,

1477
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:16,600
when we create the stairs for a standard room

1478
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,200
What we could do here is say like okay, where are the stairs are in

1479
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:21,800
this thing?

1480
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,300
Let's just add another entity here.

1481
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:30,100
That's going to be like specifically, just for this test, will begin a

1482
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:32,600
ground identity here and we'll end it here.

1483
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And the placement of this entity is I guess just going to be whatever

1484
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,800
this is this this P offset or whatever.

1485
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,000
I guess now, I think about it.

1486
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,400
This is this is really outside of this stepping to.

1487
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,000
So after it's really after we're done, we would add it.

1488
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:55,300
And so we want to add something that puts, you know, a volume in place

1489
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:56,800
for the.

1490
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,100
So the entity can

1491
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,600
An entity that has that flag set?

1492
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,500
Whose bounding volume is like the region of the stairwell so that when

1493
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,700
you go in there, you would you know, it would it would detect that and

1494
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:12,800
do the right thing.

1495
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So we want to set that flag, first of all, so that it will know that.

1496
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,300
This is something that's, that's entity is going to control the camera

1497
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,400
when you're inside it.

1498
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:26,400
And similarly, you know, we need to set a bounding volume Bond

1499
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:32,000
bounding volume for it, that sort of logically places it.

1500
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,000
It needs to be.

1501
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,500
So what I can do for that is say like okay we know the Collision

1502
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,500
volume is going to be a rectangle.

1503
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,600
Of some kind here.

1504
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,600
I don't know what I have to work with.

1505
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,300
It looks like these p-values, what is this standard room thing look

1506
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,200
like?

1507
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:59,800
where is that standard room so you can see

1508
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Of these World positions here, right?

1509
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,000
So what I can do is just grab one of those and then create the

1510
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,300
dimensions that should fit around it, right?

1511
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:13,000
So we know where the hole is in the world.

1512
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,100
So the p-value for it would just be that the room, right?

1513
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:19,200
There's alt P.

1514
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,100
We know that the hole is that offset x 3.

1515
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,700
I guess these are a values here, right?

1516
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,800
So, Plus radius

1517
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,400
so, you know, we would want these indexes into it.

1518
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,700
So there's the X

1519
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,900
There's the why.

1520
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,800
And we know that like the offset X in this case should be 3.

1521
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,900
The Y offset should be the middle which looks like zero.

1522
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,300
So it should look like that.

1523
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,800
That's the center of it and we know the Collision volume I guess we

1524
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,300
can do a Center Gym in this case.

1525
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:58,000
We know it should just be centered, just around 00, I guess.

1526
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:00,000
Or that's may not actually be true.

1527
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,500
Maybe want to do a min max.

1528
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
So what we want to do in this case is we know that the Min is going to

1529
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,500
be well, we know we're going to be only a half tile.

1530
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:13,400
In X on either side, right?

1531
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,600
In fact, probably a little less than that.

1532
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,100
Even if it's about overlapping The Entity, we probably want to it to

1533
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,200
be very small.

1534
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:32,100
So we probably want like an X, you know, X gem to be something pretty

1535
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:37,000
small like tile side and M should probably, it should probably be just

1536
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,300
a very small fraction that so it'd be like kind of thin because it's,

1537
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,200
it'll be an overlap test, so if we get close enough to it, you know,

1538
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,500
it should be fine at that.

1539
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:53,400
So tile side and M, we know that the the mean is going to be.

1540
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,500
Oops, the negative X DM here.

1541
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,400
The max is going to be the positive X dim.

1542
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,900
Z wise, our minimum is actually going to be down from our position

1543
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:08,600
because we're you know we're talking about going down the stairwell, I

1544
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,200
believe, right?

1545
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,900
Because let me just double-check yet because these are Z this this

1546
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:16,200
stairwell is created in a downward fashion not that it really matters.

1547
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:19,100
I guess we could do not for one but you know, the downward stairwell

1548
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,400
means that the Z.

1549
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,900
I'm going to leave the y4 S.

1550
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,300
The Z value of R.

1551
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,100
Suppose, this is

1552
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:29,800
Also, when we constructed this way because it's symmetric and Y as

1553
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:32,900
well, the Z values are going to be a symmetric.

1554
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:36,000
The minimum is going to be negative, however, far down.

1555
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,700
It takes to get to the bottom of the thing.

1556
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Probably,

1557
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:50,000
So it's probably like whatever that the that world's typical floor

1558
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,800
height, right?

1559
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,200
It's probably going to be, you know, most of that.

1560
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
It's probably how far we would want that volume to be.

1561
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,800
And then here, you know what

1562
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,500
Stop.

1563
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,000
Probably maybe a little bit above the surface.

1564
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,300
So you know, maybe something like

1565
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,500
And I think we get the world in here, right?

1566
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah, we do.

1567
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,900
So that all works relatively well.

1568
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,100
So the only thing we really need to figure out here.

1569
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,700
Oh, is this P relative to what is this P relative to then?

1570
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,800
Is that that world position p is not stored anywhere?

1571
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:43,300
Is that really true?

1572
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:46,900
No, it's stored.

1573
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:47,700
It started right there.

1574
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,100
I'm confused.

1575
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,300
Here's what I am.

1576
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:57,800
Oh, it's because this p is actually just a sin region p.

1577
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:09,200
Interesting, well, I guess that's not that problematic.

1578
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,400
We just need to be able to do that mapping.

1579
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,500
So really, it's just this

1580
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,200
Does that or does the mapping for us?

1581
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,200
I guess I can do that.

1582
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,100
So now we need a wide dim and the ydm in this case is going to be the

1583
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,200
tile side and M as well.

1584
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,000
But it's going to be, I guess it's two in either direction.

1585
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:38,000
And then typical floor height is actually World mode, not world.

1586
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,100
There we go.

1587
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,000
And I think that should create it.

1588
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,400
Now, we should see a bounding box up here there, right?

1589
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:53,600
And there it is.

1590
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,100
So it's a little wonky.

1591
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:01,300
Okay, so it actually, it's actually a less than or equal to 2.

1592
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,000
But that last one is actually the stair that you step on, I guess.

1593
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,900
That's okay because we probably want to do it when you get there.

1594
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,700
So that's probably fine.

1595
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,800
That's probably fine.

1596
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,800
So let's just see how that goes.

1597
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,100
So here I go over to it.

1598
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,300
So it's sort of worked.

1599
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,000
But it was took a little bit of time.

1600
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,100
Took a little longer than I wanted for it to that to detect.

1601
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,400
I got to turn off these familiars.

1602
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,500
They're driving me nuts.

1603
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,100
How many of these are we adding?

1604
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,700
One per room, I guess.

1605
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,700
We're turning those guys off their, they're driving me nuts.

1606
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,200
All right.

1607
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:53,600
So, it seems like it takes a little bit too long, like, that should be

1608
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,000
detecting it, but it's not.

1609
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,700
So I'm interested to know.

1610
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,800
Let me see if we set the bounds.

1611
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,300
Wrong.

1612
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:00,900
Okay?

1613
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,300
So there's the problem is that's the only bounds we have on the hero

1614
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,900
right now because it's just the head.

1615
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,800
That's actually a collider.

1616
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,100
And so this is too low, right?

1617
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:11,400
That means to be X.

1618
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:16,700
That needs to go up above where, it's going at the moment.

1619
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:26,700
So, if we take a look at again, it adds standard room and just change

1620
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,200
a little bit.

1621
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,600
How we're doing that height there?

1622
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:33,500
So you can see here, this is the the Z extents, why?

1623
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,800
I'm not sure what's going on here.

1624
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:36,100
I guess.

1625
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:39,100
That's because things are offset, artificially from there.

1626
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,900
So we're going to need to be more than that.

1627
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,200
I guess what we can do is say, well, let's go ahead and make it extend

1628
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,800
up to the top of this room as well.

1629
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:48,400
Not all the way up to the top, but pretty far up.

1630
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,800
So, now there's a pretty generous volume there.

1631
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,100
We hop in here.

1632
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,000
Now, we're going to go down the stairs that way, right?

1633
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,100
And off you go.

1634
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:57,900
So hopefully that's fine.

1635
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,200
We still get a little bit of clipping there on that.

1636
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,200
Because again, that guy is just really tall.

1637
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:04,100
I think that might just be the case that we need.

1638
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,300
RZ bias values to not be so big as they are.

1639
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,200
It's probably all that that's happening there, right?

1640
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,200
So now, you know, but let's keep going on this front.

1641
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,600
Although I would like to see.

1642
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,300
So if I actually, if the hopping was working, yes, you can see, it's

1643
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,100
still kind of pumps through there a little bit.

1644
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,200
Let me take a look.

1645
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,700
I want to take a look at what happens.

1646
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,600
We were in debug mode.

1647
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,200
I wonder if debug camera should always snap to the location of the

1648
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:33,800
hero

1649
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:42,100
It's probably the right thing to do but you can see how much lower

1650
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:42,300
here.

1651
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:45,200
So I think those Z bias values are too high at the moment,

1652
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:45,900
potentially.

1653
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,700
So I'm going to just go ahead and remove those a little bit.

1654
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:59,500
So I think maybe the Z bias is just too much.

1655
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,800
It's causing things to pop out way more than I think, maybe they

1656
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,400
should

1657
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,600
So, I just want to take a look at that helps at all.

1658
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,500
Yeah, so that's better.

1659
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,000
Right.

1660
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:18,400
So now you can see that that camera volume is doing exactly what we

1661
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,000
want, right?

1662
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It's like when it comes in, there were triggering the camera to go to

1663
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,900
a different location.

1664
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,200
The problem is, as you can see, like, this way of saying is like At

1665
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:30,400
first, we'll just set the camera set to where the entity is and off we

1666
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:30,700
go.

1667
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,200
The problem with that obviously is that when you do that, it's going

1668
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,000
to be very jarring.

1669
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,100
So like, you know, if we were to leave it like that in the game, it

1670
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,700
would be very disconcerting to, you know, you don't really want that

1671
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,300
to happen.

1672
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,100
You just want the camera to maybe start to move over there, and if the

1673
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:47,600
player doesn't end up going down the stairs then don't and then, you

1674
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,000
know, if they just are breathing right through it, don't do it at all.

1675
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,800
If they start going down the stairs, maybe do it a little faster, who

1676
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,000
knows?

1677
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,300
Like there's a bunch of things we could be doing there that we're not

1678
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:58,900
doing right in that sense.

1679
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,800
And also its

1680
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,300
The head doesn't?

1681
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,800
We need to work on a bunch of this stuff.

1682
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,300
The it'll be nice to finally get into their game code and just do that

1683
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,400
for no other reason than finish up.

1684
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,600
All the animation stuff to be nice and solid.

1685
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:16,700
But anyway because you can see, the head doesn't actually go downward

1686
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,200
hardly at all.

1687
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,400
It floats downward at a very slow speed.

1688
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,700
So it actually it stays up quite High, you see if I can demonstrate

1689
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,500
that a little bit better.

1690
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,000
See how slowly that comes down for whatever reason, not sure what the

1691
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,500
reason is.

1692
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,400
Whereas that's how far down it should already be on the second stair

1693
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,400
and it didn't even get there.

1694
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,300
By the time we got here.

1695
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:45,700
So the spring on the head for vertical is just not correct at all.

1696
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,800
But anyway, that's neither here, nor there.

1697
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:50,600
Anyway.

1698
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:56,100
So well, alright, so I guess that's all we're going to do today

1699
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:59,300
because there were now at the five-minute warning.

1700
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,500
But tomorrow, I think that's pretty clear.

1701
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,200
What we should be doing tomorrow is we should just go ahead and make

1702
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:13,200
a, make the camera moves smoothly so that, you know, it moves over

1703
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:18,300
gradually and then moves back over every time, you know, it wants to

1704
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:22,100
change position, it's being more gradual and it thinks a little bit

1705
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:22,700
harder about

1706
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,100
Where it should be looking.

1707
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,800
Let's go ahead and go to the Q and A

1708
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:34,800
And I don't have I had to reinstall this machine that I use to monitor

1709
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,300
the chat because Manjaro was complete was dying.

1710
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,000
A rather horrible death on me.

1711
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:46,500
And so I was wondering if someone could say, could make it do Q&A in

1712
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,400
the, in the twitch chat.

1713
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,800
I don't have a login on this one.

1714
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,400
Yet I can see the twitch chat.

1715
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:53,600
I just can't type into it.

1716
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,300
Chuckles.

1717
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,100
How's it going?

1718
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:09,600
Two questions, one, how come rad aren't owning every Avenue of

1719
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,900
compression existence like video codecs, okay.

1720
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:19,400
And to is handmade here at some point, beautiful will be beautiful 2D

1721
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,800
animated like the excellent.

1722
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,900
Excellent hallo night that everyone should play.

1723
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,000
By the way, you can you girls?

1724
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:25,500
I don't know why.

1725
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,900
You always try to get me to play Halo night.

1726
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,800
I played it.

1727
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:28,900
I did play it.

1728
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:29,900
I mean, I have it.

1729
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,700
I can't remember how I got it.

1730
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,000
I want to say that it was in some kind of a bundle or something,

1731
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,900
because I don't know that I actually bought it or maybe it was on sale

1732
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,100
in like a steam sale and I bought it.

1733
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,700
But somehow I did end up buying it and I did play a little bit of it.

1734
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,800
That's about all, I can say I have not played much of it.

1735
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:54,900
As for whether it will be 2D animated, there's not going to be a whole

1736
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,200
lot of Animation in handmade here.

1737
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:59,100
I probably will because most of it will be somewhat procedural

1738
01:36:59,100 --> 01:36:59,700
animation.

1739
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,600
But we do have a bunch of art from Anna that we can put in.

1740
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,500
And so pretty soon, when I get a chance to build a new art pack, we

1741
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,600
will we will do that because it's a lot better are for what we're

1742
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:11,300
doing as well.

1743
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,000
It's like at the proper perspective and stuff so it will look more

1744
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,300
correct, which would be nice, too.

1745
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,300
As for how come rad aren't owning every Avenue of compression in

1746
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,400
existence like video codecs.

1747
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:29,600
I well, I mean the reason is because I think they do own.

1748
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:32,700
The only ownable part of video codecs.

1749
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:33,700
They do right?

1750
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:35,200
They sell a proprietary video.

1751
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,600
Codec for games and it's the video.

1752
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,600
Codec that's used in every game.

1753
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,100
Pretty much, you know, there's very few games that don't use it.

1754
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,200
If they show video

1755
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:50,300
They can't own something like the MPEG spec because that's a giant,

1756
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,400
patent licensing, pool situation, where nobody owns the codec.

1757
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,800
It's just a bunch of companies who are trying to extract royalty fees,

1758
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,300
and also companies, who want to do video stuff themselves and are

1759
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,000
trying to lessen their patent, royalty fees, get together and put a

1760
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
bunch of patents in and make a god-awful heinous giant codec, that is

1761
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:15,500
a real pain in the butt to use and that's the, you know, open standard

1762
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,000
which is not really.

1763
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:16,700
Reopen.

1764
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:18,900
And there's that.

1765
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:20,800
That's, that's all there is really.

1766
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,400
There isn't another market for video codecs out there.

1767
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:29,100
Nobody buys video codecs for movies because, you know, Blu-ray disc

1768
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:32,700
has to have the Blu-ray standard movie format on it, which is going to

1769
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,200
be mpeg-4 or whatever, right?

1770
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,500
And that is a giant patent licensing hands-off situation.

1771
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,100
That, you know, you can't, you can't get into that market at, all

1772
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:41,600
right.

1773
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,000
All rad could really do was patent a bunch of video things and then

1774
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,600
put them into the MPEG patent pool, but

1775
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:52,400
The people at rad such a you know, have the same opinion as I do about

1776
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,500
software patents which is that they're bad for the industry so they

1777
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,200
don't do that.

1778
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:59,900
So I don't know that there's anywhere else they can really

1779
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,300
No, you know, I don't I'm sure they would Branch out into another

1780
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:12,600
Avenue of video compression if there was somewhere that you could make

1781
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,300
money doing it.

1782
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,000
But I really just don't know that there is

1783
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:31,400
Sausage.

1784
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:31,800
Superb.

1785
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:35,100
Why don't you search and replace with a new short and sexy data types?

1786
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,800
I should probably, maybe someday we will spend some time to just takes

1787
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,200
a while.

1788
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,300
Oh, Halo night, I'm sorry.

1789
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,700
I was thinking Shovel Knight because you were I thought you were the

1790
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,500
one who was always telling me that Shovel Knight.

1791
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,400
Do you just only ever recommend to me to play games that are called

1792
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,400
something night Halo night?

1793
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,200
I would very much like to play.

1794
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:57,300
I didn't know it was out yet.

1795
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,900
It's on my wish list, so maybe I receive.

1796
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,200
I don't know if I got a notification or not, I will definitely play

1797
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:03,000
Halo night.

1798
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:08,600
I have not played it yet, but but I would, I will definitely be

1799
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,000
checking it out, yes.

1800
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,300
Sorry, I got confused.

1801
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,600
Did beef is the camera for this game going to be plenty smart or just

1802
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,800
a little smart in this staircase?

1803
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,800
I imagine you might want to measure the velocity of the player to not

1804
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,500
have it affect the camera if the player is rushing straight past.

1805
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:32,800
Yeah, I

1806
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,900
I would say that's a pretty easy thing to add.

1807
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,700
I wouldn't say that's particularly smart either.

1808
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:48,000
So that's a level of smarts like that's that's not too smart for this.

1809
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,300
I think like, I don't want to have some gigantic AI camera thing or

1810
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:54,300
anything, but that's a pretty reasonable thing we can add that

1811
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:57,300
doesn't, it's not too smart on the smart, it's not too smart for its

1812
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,200
own good kind of thing.

1813
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:01,700
So, I would be totally down with that in that, we just have to get a

1814
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:03,800
little further on the, to actually have the camera doing e

1815
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,300
interpolation first to make that do it.

1816
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,800
But yeah, I mean checking the checking the velocity of the players is

1817
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,700
not too bad.

1818
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:22,800
You know, in in terms of that Collision for example if we you know in

1819
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,800
here where we say if any of the overlaps entity what we can do is just

1820
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:34,300
say like oh yeah you know the the inner product of these.

1821
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,000
like,

1822
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I guess I could do it here.

1823
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,500
Not sure how how I would want to do is exactly what we don't even need

1824
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:47,000
to do the inner product really, unless we specified a V3.

1825
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,400
So, for right now, we could even do it even simpler.

1826
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:54,000
We could just say, you know, if the entity which is the player in this

1827
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,100
case, if the entities velocity, what do we have?

1828
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,100
Is DP, I guess.

1829
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:03,500
That is in the y direction.

1830
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:05,400
Not sufficient.

1831
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:11,300
Let's say, you know, if it's less than some value than, you know, our

1832
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:14,500
sorry, it has to be greater than some value in order to actually care

1833
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,900
or something like this, right?

1834
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,000
So we can definitely do that.

1835
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,400
And then in theory, you know, when the players hopping or wrong, it

1836
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,300
won't do anything there, but if they start to move down, it will,

1837
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:29,800
right?

1838
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,500
So something like that is really pretty easy for us to do.

1839
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:38,000
The only thing is yeah, but in order for that to still, in order for

1840
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,500
the camera to feel it, all good, we have to add the interpolation,

1841
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:44,500
which we can do tomorrow and maybe we'll say to do

1842
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:53,200
Make entity parameters that control velocity direction measurement.

1843
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,600
But yes, so I do think that's a good idea, but

1844
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,400
as we all day is the debug text draw order.

1845
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,000
Still inverted.

1846
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,200
It seems so by the looks that you liked text is a professed working.

1847
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,400
Yes, so we haven't finished updating the debug stuff at all.

1848
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:20,200
There's the clip rex have to be fixed in there and the debug draw

1849
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,800
order has to be fixed.

1850
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,600
I don't know if that might be the only two things, I don't know, but

1851
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,800
we will, we will fix them eventually when we're done with.

1852
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,700
When we were finishing, all the cleaning up from the different camera

1853
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:43,200
stuff, but team R&B Greenies Casey last week during the wonderful a

1854
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,300
mermaid shot, you demonstrate how to dynamically create code in

1855
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:48,200
memory, you have mentioned in the past how you do a fair bit of

1856
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,900
metaprogramming and I always envisioned that you would generate C C++

1857
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,700
code to files when you tackle metaprogramming do you write out to disk

1858
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:57,800
first and then have the compiled or do you do it all in memory?

1859
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,000
Some of what you did last week?

1860
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:05,600
I would like to do it all direct compilation but I have never had

1861
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
enough time to really write a good code generator.

1862
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:11,300
So I don't do that typically when I generate code I generated and feed

1863
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,400
it through an existing C compiler somewhere.

1864
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:20,600
So you know, if it's if the rest of the project is being compiled with

1865
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:25,700
Visual Studio, it gets compiled with Visual Studio or whatever if it's

1866
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:26,700
llvm it Sylvia.

1867
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,400
I don't currently do any code gen.

1868
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:29,700
I would

1869
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:30,400
I'd like to.

1870
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,300
And I have sort of the start of some of that stuff that I've done kind

1871
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,600
of, in my spare time by just have not had time to devote at work to

1872
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,900
it, to really making a good code generator for x64 that I can switch

1873
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,100
to.

1874
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:45,900
So that, you know, I don't have to use official compiler anymore at

1875
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,900
that point be nice because then I wouldn't have to use compare at all

1876
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:50,900
really because I could just parse the sea and dump it into the code

1877
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:55,500
generator and then off then you don't even have to use them as we see

1878
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:56,100
anywhere at all.

1879
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:56,900
Which would be nice.

1880
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,800
But there's just a lot of stuff that's involved in that, you know.

1881
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,300
Debugging also becomes a problem at that point, right?

1882
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:06,000
Because you know, generating ecstasy for code is one thing.

1883
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,200
But you got to generate debug symbols because if you don't generate

1884
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,300
debug symbols, then you can't step into the code, you've generated in

1885
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,100
the debugger, and that becomes very difficult to debug, right?

1886
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,200
So, you know,

1887
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,100
just it's a lot involved.

1888
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,900
Hey Casey, I was messing around with four by four matrix,

1889
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:34,400
multiplication implementations and whipped out 10 variations some of

1890
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,100
which naive and others were opto with Cindy out of curiosity

1891
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,100
performance test them on BC clanging.

1892
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:43,700
GCC, I was very surprised results as the compiler seem to be doing

1893
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:46,900
very different things for this simple task, for example, on GCC the

1894
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:48,900
Nate, the naive version sometimes.

1895
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:50,600
Beat what I thought would be optimal.

1896
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,200
Cindy, seems like it was able to Output better intrinsics, but on

1897
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:57,700
clang, it was the opposite msv seems to have failed at honor

1898
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:01,000
A loop and all implementations were crap except for a manually

1899
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,100
enrolled Cindy version.

1900
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,400
I realize this is a rat hole of a problem.

1901
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:05,900
But is this really where we're at?

1902
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:07,300
In terms of philosophy of right?

1903
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:10,300
Once the ladies provide you the best thing for any for the platform.

1904
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:15,600
Any thoughts, I guess the first thing I would say is I'm the wrong

1905
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,300
person.

1906
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,500
There's probably a good rant about that somewhere.

1907
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,300
I'm the wrong person to do it and the reason for that is because 99%

1908
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:27,700
of my time is spent doing architecture.

1909
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:30,800
And code to do stuff.

1910
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,600
That is not 100% performance critical, right?

1911
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,000
As soon as you drop into Cindy, you're talking about stuff that's

1912
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
going to be performance-critical.

1913
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,500
You're probably not going to be doing a lot of Cindy optimizations to

1914
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,600
the level, where you're looking with the compilers outputting, when

1915
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,400
you're not talking about performance critical stuff.

1916
01:46:45,700 --> 01:46:49,700
And I just write a ton of code and a lot of that code is not in that

1917
01:46:49,700 --> 01:46:55,600
category if you take someone like Jeff or Fabien, who live day-to-day

1918
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,700
a lot more in the we are trying to do.

1919
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,700
Translations two things, a lot of time, you know.

1920
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:03,000
I don't know exactly how much of their time they spent doing it.

1921
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:06,700
But I would say 20 or 30%, might not be an unreasonable estimate of

1922
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:10,500
how much time Fabien or Jeff might spend thinking about something like

1923
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:16,400
how the stuff that they're writing is going to get executed on a on a

1924
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,600
Target platform, right?

1925
01:47:18,100 --> 01:47:20,600
Because again, they tend to do stuff like okay, they'll make bank or

1926
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,500
something, and there's certain amount of code and bank and yes, that

1927
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,000
had to happen.

1928
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,300
But then at some point transitions into optimizing Bink.

1929
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,700
For lots of platforms and getting a

1930
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,900
to run, well, and lots of platforms and all these other things.

1931
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:33,500
And now you're thinking day-to-day a lot about those inverse Civic

1932
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:33,800
ways.

1933
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,300
So I'm kind of the wrong one to rant about that and I think you put

1934
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,900
the right people to rant about that are people who have to deal with

1935
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:41,300
this day to day.

1936
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:46,000
But what I can tell you is, I think for certain the state is very poor

1937
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:51,300
compilers, I would say there's two separate things, one is the

1938
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,000
compilers are not very good at it, and the other is that the languages

1939
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,800
are not there, if you think about it, see, with intrinsic,

1940
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,500
Which is the current state of the art.

1941
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:02,900
As far as that's concerned.

1942
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:07,300
For day-to-day programming state of the Arts, the wrong term.

1943
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,300
It's the current thing.

1944
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:09,600
You mostly have to work with, right?

1945
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,800
Because you can't be introducing all these Specialized assemblers or

1946
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,100
something else into your tool chain.

1947
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,400
You know, you got a program day-to-day, you talking about code, that's

1948
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:21,000
get checked into a code, basic is compiled with Visual Studio or clang

1949
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,900
or something, right?

1950
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:25,900
All you have to work with these intrinsic.

1951
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:30,100
Those intrinsics don't really do a very good job of either a making it

1952
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:30,800
easy to specify.

1953
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:35,100
What's going on or be being able to manhandle exactly what's supposed

1954
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:37,500
to happen as a result.

1955
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,700
You do end up in situations where the simple code, you would write.

1956
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:42,800
That should be relatively clear how to make it work.

1957
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,100
And very straightforward optimizations like Loop unrolling.

1958
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,600
You might want to have happen, often can go horribly wrong.

1959
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,300
When the compiler gets its hands on it and that's unfortunate.

1960
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,400
That's why we have things like IP C or whatever it is.

1961
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:00,100
The the is that what it's called the Intel compiler that that is made

1962
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:05,200
for doing why'd you know, versions of things.

1963
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,100
That's why we have some of those markup things available where you can

1964
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:12,000
more easily, Mark something up in the compiler, knows what you're

1965
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,900
trying to do and it can generate good code for it.

1966
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,800
Those things have not mainstreamed as well as they need to write.

1967
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:24,400
And so now you're constantly in a situation of like, well, maybe, you

1968
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:30,300
know, we can go, do you know, compile this part of the code on this

1969
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,700
other compiler and get better.

1970
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,400
Default Behavior, unfortunately, that's not the default thing.

1971
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:41,700
Again, I think this is mostly because most programmers, who probably

1972
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:46,800
affect the C++ specification are not game, programmers and more.

1973
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,300
Specifically, they're not getting programmers.

1974
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,200
Like the people at rad, who spend most of their time, have to deal

1975
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:51,900
with this stuff.

1976
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,400
They're probably people.

1977
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,200
Well, they're not people like me because the C++ standard wouldn't

1978
01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,800
look anything like, it looks like it was me but they're people whose

1979
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,400
job duties look, more like mine.

1980
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,900
They're writing code where the performance critical parts are

1981
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:10,600
Very uncommon in terms of the amount of code they have to write.

1982
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,300
So they're not focusing on that.

1983
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:19,200
And they're not pushing that as hard as they need to, to get it to a

1984
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:19,900
better place.

1985
01:50:20,600 --> 01:50:24,100
So, you know, I'm sure someday maybe it would get there but it's

1986
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:25,300
probably not where it needs to be.

1987
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,400
And that probably explains most of what you're seeing.

1988
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:31,300
However, again, I'm I can't really rant on it because I'm definitely

1989
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:37,000
not the right profile of a programmer to really even say how bad they

1990
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:37,500
are.

1991
01:50:37,700 --> 01:50:41,200
Sometimes I do drop into assembly and look at what's getting generated

1992
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:44,900
for certain things, but that is such a rare day for me.

1993
01:50:44,900 --> 01:50:45,700
Given the in

1994
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:46,800
Warmest amount of programming.

1995
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,100
I have to do every day, the amount that's performance.

1996
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,500
Critical is super tiny on the current project I'm working on, right?

1997
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,100
So, that's just a reality of the type of project that be working

1998
01:50:59,100 --> 01:50:59,800
happen to be working.

1999
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,800
On, and it does happen, but it's just really rare.

2000
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:08,400
And so, I'm just not in a position.

2001
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,400
I don't have enough day-to-day experience with it to really say,

2002
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,700
here's what these compilers are doing.

2003
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:19,000
And why I do think that the place that this hurts the most oddly

2004
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,800
enough, I think at the moment is not so much on PCS where you have so

2005
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,600
much, heavy iron performance.

2006
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:27,800
A lot of times tons of cores, really wide.

2007
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Same D out of order execution.

2008
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,100
Giant caches blah blah blah, the place where you really feel it is in

2009
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:36,600
the poorly designed mobile chip market, right?

2010
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:39,000
Some chip designs are probably quite good.

2011
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,600
I've heard that Apple's A9 is pretty amazing.

2012
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,200
For example.

2013
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,900
Other chip designs out there.

2014
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:50,000
Apparently not so good and it ends up being really important how you

2015
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,100
and schedule your instructions or whatever on.

2016
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:58,500
You know some of these chips because they're really bad at, you know,

2017
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:01,900
doing working around poor assembly.

2018
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,300
You know, an Intel chip is very good at working around for assembly,

2019
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,900
right?

2020
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:08,400
It doesn't mean that better assembly, you know.

2021
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,900
Better instructions teams aren't still better.

2022
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,100
They are, but the chip does it.

2023
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:16,600
Menace amount of work to handle bad code.

2024
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:22,000
Well, that doesn't become the case on some of these chips in power

2025
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,900
constrained, their less mature architectures, that maybe have less

2026
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:30,800
good Engineers working on them as the people, you know, who knows?

2027
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,900
There's only so many great chip Architects to go around blah blah

2028
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:34,300
blah.

2029
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:41,500
In those scenarios you may end up in situations where the, the degree

2030
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,900
of meticulousness

2031
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,400
Of the code that you can turn around those platforms, can make a huge

2032
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:46,000
difference.

2033
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:52,900
And that's I know I've heard some things without naming names of chips

2034
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,100
or the people complaining about them.

2035
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:56,500
I know I've definitely heard some things about stuff like that where

2036
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:57,300
it's like, yeah, okay.

2037
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:02,900
So would we like better ability to compile things on ecstasy for yes,

2038
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:07,100
but ecstasy for is super powerful X would be like better things to

2039
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:09,000
deal with this random phone.

2040
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,500
That happens to be a common Android phone or something.

2041
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,100
It's like, yeah, that's where we really.

2042
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,700
It because it hurts us really bad there.

2043
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,600
When we fall off the good path and the compiler is generating like a

2044
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,000
lot of stuff that falls off the good path, you know?

2045
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,000
So I remember, you mentioned some point that you were really

2046
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,400
interested in salt and Sanctuary, have you played it?

2047
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:40,400
I don't think I ever mentioned that I think you're thinking of someone

2048
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:40,900
else.

2049
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:44,100
I did not work on that game and I have not played that game and to the

2050
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:44,700
best of my knowledge.

2051
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:48,600
I've never been interested in the game either, unless I have been

2052
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:49,800
forgetting something.

2053
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:52,000
We're just now.

2054
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,100
Could you please explain once more why you did keep camera offset Z is

2055
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:57,200
it for movement between Tom apps or something else.

2056
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,900
Yeah so the reason for that

2057
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,200
It is really very straightforward.

2058
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,100
It's just it's unclear.

2059
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:07,900
Whether it's a good idea or bad idea the idea behind it is just that

2060
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:08,700
well okay.

2061
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:12,600
So the way that we view the game is like this, here is the world we

2062
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,900
use the trees, you know whatever.

2063
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,200
Here's the hero on it.

2064
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,800
The way that we view the world is you've got a camera that's looking

2065
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,800
down on things, right?

2066
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,700
And there's the hero.

2067
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:27,500
And so the reason that I thought the camera off set Z, you know what I

2068
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:30,000
wanted to do was go from a version where we were talking

2069
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,800
talking about the center of the room as where the camera was.

2070
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,900
And then we had an offset that would move the camera around, to

2071
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:40,600
wherever we actually needed it, and I wanted to change from that to

2072
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,100
something, where we know where the camera is for real.

2073
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:47,000
And the camera has its own real position and the Simulation Center is

2074
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,400
something else and it may or may not be looking at that.

2075
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:51,800
however,

2076
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:56,500
It does make a difference which one we want to encode.

2077
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:00,900
The focus point of the camera, like, where it's looking or the camera

2078
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,600
itself.

2079
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:04,600
And what I decided to do was in code, the focus point of the camera,

2080
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,000
which can still be somewhere other than the simulation reading.

2081
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,300
So, you know, if here's the map, we may be looking over here but

2082
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,700
simulating based on this, right?

2083
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:15,500
So, the camera might be looking here.

2084
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:18,100
So like, in the case of where we move down the stairwell, for example,

2085
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,300
but the question is, do you can code the location of where you're

2086
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,600
looking from, or where you're looking?

2087
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:24,700
And what I decided to do was in code location.

2088
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:28,900
I was looking at which means I need just that pull back because we

2089
01:55:28,900 --> 01:55:33,100
don't allow the camera to slide relative to its focus focus point.

2090
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,600
But we do allow to pull back.

2091
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:39,200
So really that Z is just how far back were pulling and the reason that

2092
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:42,300
I wanted that to be encoded is because I feel like that might be a

2093
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:45,600
value that wants to be encoded separately for like bounce movement or

2094
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,400
something that I want to encode to the separate piece of the

2095
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,800
coordinate, just to make it easier to deal with, that's it.

2096
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:08,500
More 85.

2097
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:10,900
If it's off topic last tomorrow, during pre stream but fall upon D,

2098
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,100
virtualization, your main Christmas virtual functions was the

2099
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:13,500
overhead.

2100
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:14,300
You get from the interaction.

2101
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,300
That's not true.

2102
01:56:15,500 --> 01:56:18,000
That is not my main criticism about virtual functions.

2103
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:21,400
My main critic criticism criticism of virtual function is everything.

2104
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,300
There's the overhead is bad, the way it is.

2105
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:26,700
Stored is bad, it is not serializable.

2106
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:29,700
It's you cannot control the virtual function table yourself.

2107
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,900
There's there's tons of problems with virtual functions.

2108
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,800
That's not the only one.

2109
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:36,600
You can't make things fit in the

2110
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,000
Amount of space if you want to.

2111
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,500
So you can't use like packed arrays correctly, blah, blah, blah, blah

2112
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:40,600
blah.

2113
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:46,200
So there's tons of really bad problems with virtual functions.

2114
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:51,900
They're only useful in very specific circumstances and the speed hit

2115
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:54,700
is by far not the biggest one of those.

2116
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:58,400
The speed is actually the most unlikely one for me to complain about

2117
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,800
because in a lot of cases you

2118
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,100
Use Virtual functions.

2119
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:03,300
You might not care about the speed because maybe you just don't have

2120
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:04,700
very many calls, right?

2121
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,800
So the indirect call is not the bad part of virtual functions.

2122
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,400
It is a potential bad part in some circumstances, but it's by far, the

2123
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,100
least offensive part of them because calling through a function

2124
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:21,500
pointer and calling through a virtual function are usually not that

2125
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:22,000
different.

2126
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,600
There's a double in Direction in a virtual function so it could be

2127
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,300
bad.

2128
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:29,000
It could be worse, potentially, but it might also not be worse.

2129
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:29,900
It depends on the

2130
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:30,700
Circumstances.

2131
01:57:30,700 --> 01:57:32,800
So it's hard to say it certain chips.

2132
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,700
It's real bad but the exits before isn't one of those chips.

2133
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:36,400
So,

2134
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:12,900
I think that's basically everything.

2135
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:16,200
All right.

2136
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:21,100
I'm gonna go ahead and close it down.

2137
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:35,100
Thank you everyone for joining me, for another episode of handmade

2138
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:35,300
here.

2139
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:36,400
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

2140
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,100
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

2141
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:41,800
pre-order the game on handmade here dot org and it comes to the source

2142
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,300
code.

2143
01:58:42,500 --> 01:58:46,300
If you want to play around with it yourself, we also have a forum so

2144
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:48,100
you can go to ask questions a patreon page.

2145
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:50,900
You can go if you want to support the video series, a schedule bot,

2146
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,500
which tells you where we're going to be live and an episode guide

2147
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:57,600
maintained by The Fabulous May blow which tells you pretty much what

2148
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:01,800
we did every where there's also a crazy search feature that I don't

2149
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,500
know if it's in.

2150
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,800
Yet, I don't think it's in there yet because I think they're still

2151
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:06,700
working on it.

2152
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,800
You can see here that this is the episode guide table of contents.

2153
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:15,000
There's like a search thing coming to, which is kind of amazing.

2154
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,200
I don't know if we've got a demonstration of that but it's nuts.

2155
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,600
I was playing with it the other night.

2156
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,900
This is I think going to get introduced into the episode guide at some

2157
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:26,700
point but basically it's kind of crazy.

2158
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:29,900
You can go here and you can type in like anything you want.

2159
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,400
SF Gartner did this, as

2160
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,500
An interface to me, blows episode guide.

2161
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,100
You can do nuts nuts.

2162
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:41,800
So stuff like you can say, like virtual or virtual function or

2163
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:42,400
something.

2164
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:45,200
And it shows you the times that I've talked about it and you like,

2165
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:48,700
click on it and it jumps right to the time that I talked about it,

2166
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:49,300
right?

2167
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:51,400
And it even has like a timecode is thing.

2168
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:55,500
We can jump to different parts of where I was talking about it, it's

2169
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,300
just crazy.

2170
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,500
So

2171
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,300
Yeah, that's coming soon to as well.

2172
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:05,100
I don't know when that actually is getting integrated in there or what

2173
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:05,600
the plan is for.

2174
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:08,900
That I should probably ask me blow what's going on with that or us

2175
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:09,200
off.

2176
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,100
I don't know what the status is of it but it's pretty amazing stuff.

2177
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:14,700
So the stuff that people are doing with the episode guide is just

2178
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:15,100
crazy.

2179
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:19,800
It's Way Beyond anything I was ever expecting to have as a resource

2180
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:22,100
for pulling stuff out of the archives but there you go.

2181
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,700
So definitely check that stuff out.

2182
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:26,500
I will be back here tomorrow.

2183
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,600
I think we're doing the 10 p.m.

2184
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,400
I'm sorry, 10 p.m.

2185
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:29,700
10.

2186
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,300
Am Sweden tomorrow.
