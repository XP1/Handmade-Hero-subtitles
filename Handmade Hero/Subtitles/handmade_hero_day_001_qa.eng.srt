1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,600
Okay, this is the Q&A for the first day of coding on handmade hero.

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,000
And what I would like you guys to do, if you can is put at seem your

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,100
ettore in any questions that you have so that I can see them clearly

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,800
on the IRC because there's a lot of you know chat that goes on there

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,900
and I want to be able to see basically what's going on.

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,400
I want to be able to see the the direct questions so I can answer

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,700
them.

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,300
All right.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
Let's start with rice.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,100
Oh, senior Tory.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Can you show how you added the handmade hero directly to the path?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
You went a bit fast during the mainstream.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,400
Absolutely, I can.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,200
So let's go back into.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,300
If you remember the place that I decided to do.

16
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,600
That was inside handmade misc.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,500
There is a thing called shell dot bat inside shell dot bat.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,400
Basically, it's this line right here.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,900
So what this line does and I agree.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,400
This is a little confusing and part of the reason.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm actually going to be going a little slower than I went tonight.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,900
In the in future episodes because honestly, I didn't want to spend a

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,700
huge amount of time in all of this drudge work.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,200
I just kind of laugh.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
So here's how you do it, you know, off you go because once we went

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,900
done with it, we're done with it.

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,900
So yeah, I didn't believe her some of these points.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,000
But basically, the way that it works is, if you are out here in the

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
command prompt and you hit set, just the word set and hit return, you

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,800
will get all of the environment variables that are set, and those are

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
variables that are local to this shell.

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
That basically anything can use.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,200
So for example, here is one called winter.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,600
It's winter equals c: windows.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,700
And what happens is, if I type in percent the name, winter that

36
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,300
variable right.

37
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,000
And then another percent so I can close it by percents.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,800
It will substitute in the value of that environment variable in place

39
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,300
of this, of this, what I typed here, right?

40
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,600
So when I hit return, it actually ders, whatever Windsor is right?

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,100
It does that dirt, okay.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
So path.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,100
If I wanted to reference what the current setting of path is that's

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,699
just percent path percent.

45
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,300
Now in the path, each individual thing to search for is separated by a

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
semicolon, right?

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,300
So there's this semicolon this right, semicolon this?

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,700
So what I did is I just say use the the the other version of set right

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,800
cassette with nothing lists everything, but set with a variable name

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
actually sets it.

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,100
So for example, for example, set handmade demo equals.

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,800
W:.

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,100
And handmade demo code or something, right?

54
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,800
If I do set now you will notice that handmade demo is actually a

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
variable that's actually set and that'll just be that'll live for the

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,100
lifetime of this shell window.

57
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,800
Anyone who wants to now in fact, Echo Prince things out so I could do

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,200
that.

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,900
For example, there it is, right.

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
There is my handmade demo.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,800
So if I hit percent path up here, that means insert the value of path

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,100
as it stands right now.

63
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,900
So all

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
It hear what I just said, set path.

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,900
The variable equal to itself, but put before it right our thing.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
So basically put us before everyone else.

67
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,000
That's all I did.

68
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,900
So that line right?

69
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,800
There is all you need to do to change the path.

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,700
It's pretty simple.

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
Okay, let's see here.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Where are we?

73
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,300
Why is my RC wigging out here?

74
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,700
It's going crazy.

75
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,700
Because I started with rice house.

76
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Where did he go?

77
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,100
There we go.

78
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,300
Okay.

79
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Sorry.

80
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,400
Sorry about that.

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,400
I do crazy.

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,600
I don't know.

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,200
Perhaps it.

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,300
Do.

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,400
Yo, Chrissy, do all windows programs written in C.

86
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,900
C++.

87
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,300
Use win?

88
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Main does the witness have the same starter code yet?

89
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
Everything basically starts at win main.

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,100
So the witness doesn't, we're the code for the witness, the platform

91
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,800
code for the witness, and the platform code for handmade.

92
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,100
Here are very different.

93
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,400
Actually, the witness is much more sprawling with its proper platform

94
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,900
code.

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
I will be showing you, basically, the way to

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,800
Things in a much more lockdown fashion and that just comes from me

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,800
having shipped a lot of cross-platform code for a lot of years.

98
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,100
I guess I should cross platform for my very first thing that I did

99
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,500
professionally was cross-platform.

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
So I keep things like lockdown hard and the witness is not locked down

101
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,900
hard.

102
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,100
It's a little more typical.

103
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,700
I would say actually of Ginkgo basis where it's not, so locked down

104
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,100
hard.

105
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,200
So we will be doing a much more rigid barrier between the operating

106
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,900
system and the game whereas the witness is much more fluid.

107
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's see using GCC a compiled without having to specify user through

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,300
D2.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:52,800
Lib.

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
What is the difference here?

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
Between Microsoft compiler and GCC?

112
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,600
I don't know because I don't compile what you see on Windows, but I

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,500
would suspect that GCC basically has a different import library of

114
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,800
scheme.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
Now, one thing that you should understand is that well, you know, what

116
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,800
should I break out?

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,500
Depends know.

118
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,600
We're going to save this.

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,400
We're going to save this for tomorrow basically, but so I'll say part

120
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,000
of it, but I'm going to

121
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,500
The rest of it, tomorrow, we'll see the rest of it.

122
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,300
But basically, what you're doing, when you're linking with these

123
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,400
libraries is you're not actually grabbing real code for the most part.

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Normally.

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,300
What a library is a library of code that actually links into your

126
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,800
executable.

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,300
That's what a lib normally is.

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,600
But these are special lives.

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
These are import lives.

130
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,500
And what an import lib is is it's basically just a jump table in some

131
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,900
sense.

132
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,400
It's basically just a bunch of Stubbs such that when you actually get

133
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,200
loaded by the operating system, those stub calls will actually get

134
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,000
replaced with where the actual jump to the real code.

135
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,600
Or the operating system that gets mapped, you know, into your memory

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,100
space GCC, which I'm assuming you mean Ming went and being WS.

137
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,200
G CC, on on Windows may have a different convention for how it does

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,600
the import live.

139
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,900
So

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,300
You just already have them all and you may just linked with all of

141
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,400
them all the time or something.

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know.

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,300
I'd have to go look for GCC at GCC.

144
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,500
But what actually happens at the end is always the same, which is that

145
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,900
when Windows loads, it has basically a dynamic link patching system

146
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,100
that goes to your executable and patches, the places that it needs to

147
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,300
to point into itself.

148
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,100
So the calls work,

149
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,800
Let's see.

150
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,800
Do do what type of milk you're drinking almond milk.

151
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,500
How do you write a render?

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
That is Harbor accelerated?

153
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,800
We will be getting to that way.

154
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,500
Way way later.

155
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,000
We're actually going to be writing our own renderer first instead of

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
writing a her accelerated one.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,400
So that people can see how to do every last piece of the thing.

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,500
Can we get your Dottie Max and you always code without line numbers?

159
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,800
Yes.

160
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,700
I always go without line numbers and the .m x value is included in the

161
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,000
source.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,900
So if you download Source, you get the D-Max with it.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
This is the most important question.

164
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Let's see.

165
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,500
Will there be a sushi bar?

166
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,000
Samurai Easter egg and handmade hero.

167
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,300
Maybe we'll see if we use Visual Studio.

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,200
Do we need to tell the Linker?

169
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,700
Every Library will be using like you did?

170
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Or is this?

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
Because of the different IDE?

172
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,900
If you are inside Visual Studio?

173
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,400
You?

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,700
I don't know which one's it specifies for you automatically.

175
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,200
It probably specifies, some for you automatically, but actually, yes,

176
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,800
you do.

177
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,600
There.

178
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,300
Actually is If You're Building inside there when you're in the project

179
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,400
settings, there actually is a

180
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,300
I don't know if I can show that easily.

181
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,600
Maybe I can in the old Visual Studio.

182
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
Let's see.

183
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,900
Let's see.

184
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,200
Can we do anything here now, we can't so this it's I'm sorry.

185
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,000
I can't really show you very effectively because we don't have an

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,800
actual project loaded here that will have those settings.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,300
But basically inside the settings there's a Linker setting and it has

188
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,400
like additional Libs.

189
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,300
In there and you have to put the additional lives in there, so I don't

190
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,500
suspect you'll have to put user 32 because I suspect that's one of the

191
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,100
ones they probably add by default for you, but you may have to add

192
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,800
some like if you used windsock.

193
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Like, if you use the sockets Library, you may have to put one's like

194
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
that for example.

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Is there a reason you do not recommend using the developer command

196
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,100
prompt shortcuts from the start menu?

197
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Which set up all the pasta for you and still let you run batch files.

198
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Not particularly.

199
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,100
I just wanted to show you how to do it yourself.

200
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
He's talking about inside here.

201
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,000
If you go to, where is that?

202
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,799
Where is visual studio?

203
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,600
2013?

204
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,100
Is it in?

205
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Why is it 2012?

206
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:42,799
Okay.

207
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,600
Well, who knows?

208
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,000
Inside here?

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
There's usually a thing.

210
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Lets you actually, you know what?

211
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
I can't even find it though.

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,300
I guess would be the first reason.

213
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,700
Well, point being inside.

214
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,400
You should have had when you installed it.

215
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,700
There should have been some way for you to actually get to essentially

216
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,800
a

217
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,800
A launcher that will sort of make a shell for you to use with Visual

218
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,000
Studio, but I wanted to show you how to do that stuff yourself.

219
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So you can make it again handmade hero.

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Everything's handmade.

221
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,300
We're going to do everything from scratch.

222
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,200
That's just how it goes.

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
So if you want to, you can look for that one.

224
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,700
There's nothing wrong with that one.

225
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,000
I just want people to know what it was actually doing so you could

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,400
see.

227
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,800
How much experience do I have writing?

228
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,700
Audio processing code?

229
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,500
Not a whole lot.

230
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,100
I guess I just wrote you, I prosecuted you mean effects and filters

231
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,400
and stuff.

232
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,500
Not too much.

233
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's see what you make a video about setting up a program environment

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,900
on Mac Linux, as well.

235
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,500
Yes, eventually, we will be doing that as well.

236
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,800
And I will basically show you how to setup emacs on those with a

237
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
command shell, that builds the game just like I do here.

238
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,700
Well, be a 2d or 3D game.

239
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
It will be a 2-D game.

240
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,200
Because I want to basically focus on how to do all of the I want to

241
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,500
focus on the code and not the math, 3D brings in a lot of a lot of

242
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:58,700
math.

243
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,200
It also brings in a lot of pipeline stuff.

244
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,400
That is not.

245
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
That is often.

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,100
Very transient.

247
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,300
That isn't going to last very long.

248
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,000
It's going to be different every year and so I was hoping with 2D

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
because there are a lot of great 2D games out there.

250
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,500
In fact, all my favorite games right now happened to be 2D.

251
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,400
I was hoping by going

252
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,100
2D I could focus on stuff.

253
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,900
That was more Timeless stuff, that will be good and that you want to

254
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
know forever instead of stuff that you'll only want to know like this

255
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:23,900
year.

256
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,100
Let's see to our streams know, we're only doing one, our streams plus,

257
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,700
and a half hour of question and answers, because it seemed like people

258
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,200
were not gonna be able to handle two hours.

259
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
What style of game are?

260
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,700
You making an approximate ETA on release?

261
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,400
The style of game will be announced probably next week when we sort of

262
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,800
get to there once we actually get to it.

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,100
I'll talk more about it.

264
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,800
But the ETA on release is completely unknown because as you may

265
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,100
imagine I have never tried to code something completely live before.

266
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,100
So I have no way of ball packing a time.

267
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,100
I feel like the fact I have to explain everything as I go is obviously

268
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,500
going to mean that it's going to take a lot longer than it normally

269
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
woods, and I don't know how to predict that.

270
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,500
Will the game be windows-only are with the Kobe from Mac as well?

271
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,800
The code will be for all platforms.

272
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,200
Yeah, we'll do a Mac, will do a Linux will do a Raspberry Pi.

273
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,500
So almost all the game code will be platform-independent, but then the

274
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,900
other parts will be platform dependent and I will show you how to make

275
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,800
one for each of them.

276
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:33,700
Let's see, will you do extended livestream exceptions such as delving

277
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,300
into a topic?

278
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
You're so interested in talking about in a, to talk about it.

279
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,200
Even after last year's already an hour long.

280
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
It's probably inevitable.

281
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
I mean, I'll try to keep that sort of thing to a minimum and I'll try

282
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,000
to keep the streams to basically be stuff.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,100
That's educational things that you will want to know.

284
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,700
And if there's something that I feel that we should really talk about.

285
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,600
I'd put it in there.

286
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
But yeah, we might have some times where we just do kind of tangents

287
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,100
and stuff as important.

288
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
Can you show the command-line parameters that you set in the shortcut?

289
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,800
Yes, I

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,500
Han.

291
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,200
So, the command parameter parameter settings shortcut, they are here

292
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,000
and I will make them larger.

293
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
For you as well.

294
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,700
There's gotta be a way to make that bigger.

295
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,500
So let's see.

296
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,300
A Liberation mono 11, okay.

297
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,400
So this is what I did in the Shell.

298
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,200
I basically did / K which says start with this and then I did she'll

299
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,400
dot bat which is our shell that we wanted the thing that we wrote

300
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,400
together and that just basically means execute this on start up when

301
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,100
you start up.

302
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,600
So hopefully that's, that's really clear and you can see that there.

303
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,300
I can also if you guys want I can copy this into sort of a notes file

304
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,400
so that you'll have it when you get the source tree so I could do

305
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,900
that.

306
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Let's put that in Shell dot bat.

307
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,500
So in Shell dot bat.

308
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm just making a comment here.

309
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,700
It says.

310
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,200
To run this at startup use this as your shortcut Target.

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,100
And there we go, so they're okay.

312
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,300
Let's see.

313
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,300
What is your favorite Linux distribution?

314
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,100
And why is it Fedora little bit of leading question?

315
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,300
I don't have a favorite Linux distribution.

316
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,100
I just run whatever actually runs I'm running Ubuntu on this laptop.

317
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,900
That is to my left here that I'm reading the chat on and that is

318
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,300
because it's the only one that would install on it.

319
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,500
Actually none of the other ones worked.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
At the time, that was my only choice.

321
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,900
Will I will I be able to follow you just using visual studio 2013

322
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,400
communication?

323
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Yes.

324
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,500
I mean, Emax is just for editing code.

325
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,400
That's it.

326
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,200
And I am using visual studio Community Edition 2013.

327
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,500
That's what this is.

328
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,700
So you will literally if you just edit your code in there, instead of

329
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
an e Max, you are good to go.

330
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,900
There.

331
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,800
You won't be any different.

332
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
It's just text text.

333
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,400
This text.

334
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,000
Will you be pregnant in for alternative controllers like Xbox

335
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,100
controllers or arcade sticks?

336
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,500
Yes, we will.

337
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
At least do anything.

338
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
That is X inputs.

339
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,000
Corded.

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,500
So like Xbox game pads because they will probably be the thing we want

341
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,400
to use for this game anyway.

342
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,200
Should it not be /zi, instead of Dash, zi in build dot bat?

343
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,900
So, that's an interesting question.

344
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,500
So you notice, I put Dash t.i., The reason I put Dash t.i.

345
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,800
Is because I am a eunuch, see style person in dash, is how you

346
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
normally specify command line option.

347
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,300
In Unix Windows.

348
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,300
You often specify them that way in the compiler, it reads both, so you

349
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,600
can use either one that you want.

350
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,500
They guess, there are making basic concession to people who are used

351
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,400
to other platforms.

352
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
So you can use a slash.

353
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,900
Or a.

354
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,400
Either one works.

355
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,500
Will the game have multiplayer?

356
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,700
So there's two answers to that question.

357
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,800
Actually, it is a yes and no answer in some sense.

358
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Yes, it will support multiplayer.

359
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Meaning that I will show you how to write the code to make it so that

360
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,900
local multiplayer works.

361
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,300
I don't necessarily want to do networked multiplayer.

362
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,200
And the reason for that is because I don't know if we'll have time to

363
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,800
really do that.

364
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,200
So if we were going to do networked multiplayer, we'd actually do that

365
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,300
as sort of like after the game is out.

366
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,800
We'd add that as like a new string that was like, here's how to do the

367
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,700
networking or something.

368
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,700
But local

369
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,300
A player will definitely support.

370
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,200
The reason I say no to multiplayer is because I don't know if the game

371
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,400
design will support multiplayer.

372
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,500
So you will be able to play it with multiple players at the same time,

373
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,300
but we may disable that when we ship it.

374
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,700
If the design doesn't actually support it.

375
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,400
Does that make sense?

376
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,400
Because this is not really about game design.

377
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,700
This is about game programming.

378
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,400
So I'm going to show you the programming, for sure.

379
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,300
The design.

380
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,500
I don't know.

381
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,600
That may not happen.

382
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,100
Can you please remove the return, parentheses zero?

383
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
No, I cannot.

384
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,000
I like it there.

385
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
When can we get some details on the actual game?

386
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Not until probably we're out of Windows and have a little bit of the

387
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,600
rendering up and going because I want to focus on the platform stuff

388
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:22,900
now.

389
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,100
And when we actually do start doing the game, I want that to be kind

390
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,000
of a fun thing that we get to do after we worked through the windows

391
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,600
part of things.

392
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,800
Why don't you just compile directly in Visual Studio?

393
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,700
Because I don't like.

394
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,600
It's editor is the is the entirety of the reason I prefer to edit in

395
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,000
emacs.

396
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,700
And I also find that if you, if you learn to edit in Visual Studio,

397
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
you end up with a problem.

398
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,300
When you want to go program on Linux or you want to go program on Mac,

399
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,500
which is that Visual Studio isn't on those platforms.

400
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,100
Emacs.

401
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,500
On the other hand is the same everywhere.

402
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,500
So I can use the same editor, on all the platforms, which I really

403
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,400
like because it means that I am super fast everywhere.

404
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,900
I go.

405
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,500
I don't have to downshift because now

406
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,500
QT Creator.

407
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,099
And it doesn't work quite the same as Visual Studio or whatever.

408
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,099
I like having the same editor on all the platforms.

409
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,300
So, one of the big things I look for in a text editor, is that it has

410
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,200
to run everywhere Linux Mac windows at least.

411
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,000
And if it doesn't, then I'm probably not interested.

412
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,099
Let's see.

413
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,099
How does it feel that?

414
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:30,600
You got more than 700 simultaneous viewers on the stream.

415
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,500
That is stunning.

416
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,600
I had no idea.

417
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,900
I was not watching the numbers but that's amazing.

418
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,200
I don't know how I feel about that.

419
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,100
That is crazy.

420
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,400
I guess the main way I feel about that is I wish that we didn't have

421
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
to do the first stream as a bunch of drugs, work to get the build

422
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:45,900
working.

423
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,600
That's probably honestly how I feel about it.

424
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,400
Tomorrow stream.

425
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,800
I think will be a lot more fun because we'll be doing, you know, hey,

426
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
we got a window up and running.

427
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay, we're drawing to the window.

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's kind of more fun.

429
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,500
Right?

430
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,000
But hey, what can you do?

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
The main thing I'm trying to be in this series is honest.

432
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm doing absolutely everything exactly the way I actually do it.

433
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
There's no lies in this stream.

434
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
So I got to do what I got to do the first day when I sit down in a

435
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,800
machine, and I don't have anything installed, and I don't have

436
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,700
anything set up.

437
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,300
I got to put kanui Max on it.

438
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,900
I got to put Visual Studio on it.

439
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,400
I did those beforehand because, I mean, you have to do like, reboot

440
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,800
some stuff too, like install Visual Studio off and stuff like that.

441
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,100
So, I did those beforehand.

442
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,300
So they wouldn't interrupt the stream, but I had to go do the actual

443
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,800
setup code.

444
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,900
And you know, is it that useful to people probably not it's

445
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,100
interesting perhaps for them to see how I do it.

446
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,200
But yeah, I mean, it's none of it's really necessary for you to do.

447
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,700
You can set up your development environment.

448
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,600
Anyway that you want.

449
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,500
And I encourage you to experiment with other ways to find the way that

450
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
you like best.

451
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,600
But this is how I always set it up and that's what I got to do when I

452
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,400
start a new project.

453
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,800
So, but now that it's done, don't have to worry about it again.

454
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,400
So that's at least a good sign, you know, it's quick and it can be set

455
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
up in an hour or so.

456
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,500
That's also good to.

457
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,800
If we were to go the route where we have used like ninja too.

458
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Things that seem a can also, we'd probably still be fussing with make

459
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,100
files at this point because it would probably take two hours to step

460
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,500
the build.

461
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,100
So that is another good thing about using.

462
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,300
Just a simple build up that system is once you have build up at going,

463
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,200
your kind of, you know, you can quickly get building on any machine in

464
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,700
a very short amount of time.

465
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,700
How did you go from the XE built-in command line to using a visual

466
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,500
debugger?

467
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,800
So, that's a good question and I did show how it was done, but I

468
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,500
didn't make a big deal of it.

469
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
So I'm going to make a big deal of it now.

470
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,000
And also, by the way, when you close Visual Studio the first time, you

471
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,900
open it on an executable.

472
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,400
It makes basically a phantom project a.s Ln for it.

473
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
And when you exit, it's going to ask you.

474
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,500
If you want to save it.

475
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
You do want to save it because that'll save all your set up your

476
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
settings for your debugging.

477
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,800
So you do want to save that and it'll ask you.

478
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm going to put it in the build directory, was going to leave it in

479
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,300
there and then, you know, we're a division studio.

480
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,600
So the way that I did it.

481
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Now, if you remember I said, I said about that thing dead end, right?

482
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,100
And Deb M, it launches, the debugger, you know, launches it launches,

483
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,500
the, the IDE for us.

484
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,000
So if you want to, to bug an executable, you can type Deb em, and then

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
the name of the executable, you are trying to debug.

486
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,900
So I was trying to debug W build win32 handmade.

487
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,100
Boom, right.

488
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,600
So that is all you have to do to get into debugging is just just that

489
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,400
one line.

490
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,000
That's it.

491
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,700
And Devin is in the path.

492
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,500
If you've run that VCRs, all thing that we did to set up.

493
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,300
If CL is there, Dem should work as well because that VCR sets up the

494
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
path to both of them.

495
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,500
So anyway, this will do it.

496
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:46,400
But once you've done that, you can actually go into tools options and

497
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,500
there's a startup.

498
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,800
In here and environment their startup.

499
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,700
And there's at startup load last loaded solution.

500
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,700
You can set it to that.

501
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,900
I don't think it's set to that by default, but you can set it to that.

502
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,600
If you set it to that, then you never even have to do it ever again.

503
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,800
You can

504
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,700
Type Dev em and it'll come up and already.

505
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,400
It'll just be with the thing and you can just hit f11 to step in,

506
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,200
right?

507
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,700
Or F5 to run, right?

508
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,800
Or any of that stuff, f9c big points.

509
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It's just it's good to go.

510
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,900
So you don't have to really do any setup.

511
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,100
You just Dem the executable off you go.

512
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,400
What GDP front-end do you use on Linux QT Creator, but I really don't

513
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,000
like it.

514
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,500
Let's see.

515
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
What else we got?

516
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,600
What did you work on while working on Bink video?

517
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,000
I well, I developed pink.

518
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,300
The second version of Bink.

519
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,800
Bink to the one that's available.

520
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Now that is used in games.

521
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Now.

522
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:53,600
I was basically just a second programmer for Jeff on it for the first

523
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,500
year and a half.

524
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,000
I guess.

525
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,600
I did all of the like, I guess all of the assembly code.

526
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,200
I think I did.

527
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,300
All of the assembly code for the initial version, which was basically,

528
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,300
which wasn't so much about optimization.

529
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,500
I mean, there was optimization and stuff that we did, but it was

530
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,200
mostly about getting stuff fast enough and being flexible with just

531
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,500
changes.

532
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,700
So Jeff would be like, we need to do this stuff to it.

533
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,300
And I would re I had a bunch of stuff that I made that would like

534
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,800
generate assembly and do things.

535
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,000
So space about facilitating him as he sort of tuned to the

536
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,700
compression.

537
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,600
And I also developed filters for him.

538
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,200
So I the filters that are used in there, I did, but after

539
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,500
I was a consult on that project.

540
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,200
After I signed off on it, Fabien giessen came on.

541
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,500
He's an excellent programmer.

542
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,300
And he's the guy who does that stuff now.

543
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,000
And he really came in and like, he's a guy who did the like, the, you

544
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,100
know, tighten down the ratchet.

545
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,000
He really came in and did all the, the going through every line and

546
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,700
optimizing everything like really well for every platform.

547
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
So, pink tutus platform.

548
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,900
Our positions are probably pretty awesome right now because Fabien

549
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,200
he's real good and it was in a good State, you know when we did.

550
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,400
The when Jeff and I did the first one but I think after Fabien got

551
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,900
done with it.

552
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,000
I strongly suspect that it is, it is pretty pretty incredible right

553
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
now, but, you know, that's just, that's just me.

554
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,400
Let's see.

555
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,700
As far as sound files Go.

556
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,500
Are we going to be handwriting dot wav and MP3 loading functions.

557
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,100
We're going to handwrite dot wave and I haven't decided yet how we're

558
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,200
going to talk about compression.

559
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,800
We are going to hand, write everything.

560
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,100
So we're not going to use a library.

561
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,600
So if we do do something with compression, we're going to have to

562
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,500
write it ourselves.

563
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
The very least will be handwriting.

564
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,000
Wha've but that's very very simple.

565
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,800
You'll be shocked how easy it is to handwrite wave, but when we go to

566
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,900
actually shift the game, you're probably going to want compression.

567
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,700
And so we will do something there, but I haven't decided what it is

568
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,100
yet.

569
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,200
That's a long, long ways away because that's like ship Time stuff.

570
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
So you don't have to worry about that any time soon.

571
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,000
We'll look at the chat for viewer answers while you work.

572
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,300
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,400
I don't know what that means.

574
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,700
Please consider five our streams.

575
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,600
I can't.

576
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
No one will be able to follow it.

577
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm sorry, we got to do an hour a night.

578
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,300
I know it's painful.

579
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,700
But you know, I think you'll be surprised at how fast it goes.

580
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,300
Like I said, I think we'll have some pretty graphics on the screen

581
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,900
before Christmas and and that's pretty good.

582
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,700
Like, you'll be surprised how little work it is.

583
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:26,900
Now.

584
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,700
It's going to be a long time to we have a good game because there's a

585
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,700
lot of code that goes into a good game, but just getting something up

586
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,500
and running, you know, the Drudge work we did today is some of the

587
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,200
most drudgery represent to do.

588
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,800
Windows is going to go pretty fast.

589
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,200
I think and we'll have a nice little thing up and running where we

590
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
can, you know, move some Sprites around.

591
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
And then from there we'll be able to start really coding the game and

592
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,000
it will be good.

593
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
So five our streams aren't really that necessary.

594
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Yes, we could blast through a lot more of it, a lot more quickly, but

595
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,900
it would be a lot harder for people to follow and the whole point of

596
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,900
this thing is for people to follow it.

597
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,700
So I really want to try and keep it to an hour and mainstream night.

598
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
It's a Q&A is get long.

599
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,800
The Q&A is get long.

600
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,600
That's fine.

601
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,200
But I want the mainstream to at least stay an hour's worth of coding

602
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
on the game every night, if you can follow that.

603
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,400
That you can follow the series.

604
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,700
Let's see.

605
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,800
Is there a design?

606
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,900
Document opinion, on design docs?

607
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,500
No.

608
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,700
No.

609
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,200
We are going to do what is basically designed driven by awesome.

610
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,300
And awesome.

611
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,300
In this case will be what we think will be the most interesting thing

612
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,900
to code.

613
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,600
So we are basically going to spend most of our time sitting around

614
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,100
going.

615
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,600
Okay.

616
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,700
We finished that feature.

617
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,400
What would be the most interesting thing to try and code in this code

618
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,000
base now.

619
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,900
And if that's that everything needs to be lit on fire and the fire

620
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,800
needs to catch on things.

621
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,700
We're going to implement that if that's that we need to have like

622
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
secrets that are hidden throughout things.

623
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,700
And we're going to implement that if that's what we need a is that

624
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,500
chase you across multiple screens and try to block your progress or

625
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,600
things that we're going to code that.

626
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,600
So the game is going to all be about coming up, something, awesome.

627
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,200
Every time you finish an old thing and implementing that and we will

628
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,500
try to tune it so that it's a good game at the end of it.

629
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,200
But the goal for the design is going to be to get everything in there.

630
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
That's cool that is interesting to code.

631
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,000
So we're really going to focus on having lots of really intricate

632
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
gameplay things.

633
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
So that we can keep kind of pushing more and more stuff in that game

634
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,800
core and so that we can see how to keep it alive and keep it from

635
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
crushing under its own weight.

636
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,100
Right, which is a big problem that people have when they code things.

637
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,900
So we're going to we're going to really focus on that kind of like how

638
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,100
to add features how to keep things, Nimble, how to write stuff that

639
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
interacts well, with the other aspects of the design, that's really

640
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,900
going to be the focus.

641
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,600
So yeah, that's basically what we're going to do.

642
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,000
Let's see to do.

643
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,400
Are we able to open source?

644
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Our own implementations?

645
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,100
Might need some lights in Clarendon this.

646
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,900
I would prefer it if you didn't until I release the code into the

647
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,700
public domain.

648
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
So basically I would like it if you keep your own implementations.

649
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh, well, I guess that depends what you mean by that if you literally

650
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,100
re-implemented the whole thing like using your own code and weren't

651
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,900
just copying this code.

652
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,300
I would maybe that would be fine.

653
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,700
Either way.

654
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,300
Basically, what I say is, email me when you want to do that, like,

655
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,200
email me first and ask me because I would like the game to remain a

656
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,500
commercial game for two years at from, from from ship.

657
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,800
I would like that to be true.

658
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,700
So basically, what I would say is, email me, if you need to do

659
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,800
something before, then, if you really need to tell you before, then.

660
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,400
We've using fixed point or floating point for audio representation in

661
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,000
the game.

662
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Floating point.

663
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,100
The spec is the reason the language works.

664
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I don't know who said that.

665
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,800
I think they're laughing at it.

666
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,100
But yes, I don't care about this back at all.

667
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,700
I only care about what compilers do.

668
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,900
The spec is not relevant because the spec is only as relevant as what

669
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,100
compilers actually follow.

670
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,400
And so, I pretty much try to do what compilers actually do in a

671
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,900
compilers.

672
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,600
Do it, then I do it.

673
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,200
And yeah, that's, that's about all I have to say about that.

674
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,800
Let's see, when we move past Windows stuff.

675
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,300
We've returned to developing on Linux.

676
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,700
Are you going to stay on Windows for the bulk of the show?

677
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,500
I will probably stay on Windows for the bulk of the show, because it's

678
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,700
debugger is much better than any of the ones on Linux.

679
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,000
Visual Studio is a much much better debugger than any of the ones on

680
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,400
Linux.

681
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:22,200
If one of the newer debugger projects happens, to come to fruition and

682
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,000
is running on Linux, during the stream.

683
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Maybe we'll switch over there.

684
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,900
But until Linux has a really good debugger.

685
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,000
I wouldn't use that as the primary platform.

686
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,100
I'm for demoing where we go through and we step through things.

687
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Will you be making generic 2D animation system for rotating scaling,

688
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,500
2D Sprites over time along with an external editor for these

689
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,100
animations?

690
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,400
We will not use an external and editor website, will not write.

691
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,800
An external editor will probably use an existing editor like spriter

692
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,900
or something, but we will write a 2d animation system.

693
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
How long after the stream each day, is it going to take for the vid to

694
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:58,800
be uploaded?

695
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,100
YouTube?

696
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,000
It's the videos uploaded immediately.

697
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,200
But YouTube takes a long time to produce the various compressions of

698
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,600
it.

699
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,100
So it usually takes several hours before video fit before YouTube

700
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,000
actually has like the 1080p stream up.

701
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,100
For example, sometimes it takes many many hours for that.

702
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,100
But twitch instantly archives it.

703
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,600
So you can go on twitch under past broadcast and see them right away,

704
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
but those like disappear after a little while.

705
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,500
So the YouTube

706
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,900
Basically the backing archive because the twitch only archives for

707
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
like two weeks or something.

708
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,300
Let's see.

709
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,300
Do you have everything planned already or you coming up with ideas on

710
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,800
a daily basis?

711
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't have everything planned.

712
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,400
I have you know, I have a relatively full game planned but that's just

713
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
because I wanted to have something planned.

714
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
It's very flexible.

715
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,700
And like I said, we'll be trying to go driven more by what's going to

716
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
be interesting to code.

717
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,500
And so I have a design that is what we'll start with, but we'll be

718
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,600
free to kind of mutated as we go and add interesting things as we go.

719
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,800
Why don't I run?

720
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Windows 8, 8 .1, I would turn that around and say why would you run

721
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Windows 8.1?

722
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,300
There is nothing.

723
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,500
That Windows 7 is not doing for me that Windows 8 does for me.

724
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
So doesn't seem particularly useful.

725
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,900
OBS seems not to render some of the pop-ups that show in Visual

726
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,600
Studio.

727
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,600
Yeah, I'm worried about that.

728
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,300
And what I would like to do is I think because the serious is seems to

729
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,700
be very popular already.

730
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,400
I think what I'm going to do is try to order like some kind of

731
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,400
external capture card so I can just capture the Monitor and I don't

732
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,900
have to worry about OBS, missing stuff.

733
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,300
Because yeah, it came up like tooltips, don't show up either.

734
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,800
Apparently that at least, that was something that was said in the live

735
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,200
stream.

736
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
So so I worry about that.

737
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,900
Let's see how much emphasis on math and physics for the 2D game.

738
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,000
Well, I'm not going to try.

739
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm going to try not to make it too terribly math heavy because it's

740
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,600
more about code that about math but there is a fair bit of math that

741
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
has to happen for the code to work.

742
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,400
So there's going to be, you know, you're going to get a pretty good

743
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,600
workout of your of your high school trigonometry at the very least and

744
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,300
you'll learn some, some linear algebra by osmosis, but we're talking

745
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,900
really simple.

746
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,500
Linear algebra here like vectors.

747
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,400
We're not talking about a singular value decomposition.

748
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:14,900
Position.

749
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I recently looked at the Doom, 3 source code, and also at the ID style

750
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,700
guide, you have some guidelines for variable names and stuff.

751
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,600
No, I think you should name variables.

752
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,600
Whatever it is, that makes you the most comfortable reading them.

753
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,900
The advice earlier was, you should look at the stream more frequently,

754
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,000
or even better, get an intern to do it.

755
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't have an intern.

756
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,100
But yes, that would be fun.

757
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,900
I'm afraid I can't because I have to concentrate on what I'm teaching,

758
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,100
but I tried to basically say hold everything for the

759
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,800
You a?

760
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,800
And if something, you know, I realize that people are trying to sort

761
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,500
of give me advice and stuff in the middle of string, but that's just,

762
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,700
that's just the price of doing business.

763
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,100
When we do get, if we do get an intern in here, maybe but I don't know

764
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,700
about that.

765
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
Oh, do I know if I got the quality?

766
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,300
Seems friendly?

767
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes, I guess I did get quality settings to Twitch twitch upgraded us,

768
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,500
because I guess, because of all of you really, I'm sure it was because

769
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,300
the stream was popular.

770
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,400
So you made that happen.

771
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:11,900
Twitch.

772
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
Now, apparently has quality settings on this stream.

773
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:14,700
Not many people.

774
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,200
Get that.

775
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,400
I guess.

776
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,700
You have to be more popular or something.

777
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,100
I don't know what.

778
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,700
It is, but so it's awesome.

779
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,600
I'm super psyched.

780
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,200
They did that.

781
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,500
So thank you to all of you for making this dream popular, because I'm

782
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,100
sure if we didn't have hundreds of viewers, they would not have done

783
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,500
that.

784
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Any chance you could stream earlier.

785
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,600
It's 5 a.m.

786
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,500
Here in Europe.

787
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
No, unfortunately not.

788
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,500
I have to pick a time and that time is going to be problematic for

789
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,000
people, either.

790
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
People are going to be at work, or it's going to be too late or

791
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,800
they're going to be asleep, etc.

792
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,300
Etc.

793
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
So we're doing 8 p.m.

794
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,100
PST.

795
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,500
That's just the way it is and I apologize.

796
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,000
I put all the videos up right away.

797
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,500
So hopefully it's easy to keep up even if you're in a different time

798
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,400
zone, but and like I said, they're on Twitch immediately.

799
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
So you can you can keep up that way as well.

800
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
But I am going to try to do basically Fridays.

801
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,700
I will do the stream at a different.

802
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Time or something?

803
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,800
We'll try to pick up.

804
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,500
Best time.

805
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,600
That overlaps the least with a p.m.

806
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
PST, basically.

807
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,800
So that people who are in different time zones that are not fortunate

808
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,800
that, don't, fortunately coincide with a p.m.

809
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,600
PST can basically, at least get on one livestream a week, that that's

810
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,700
what that's the compromise that I kind of worked out in my head.

811
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,900
I hope that's okay with people.

812
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,900
You have an actual repo for the project know you will just basically

813
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,600
get a zip file.

814
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,900
If you get the source that has a zip file in it for every day.

815
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,500
So you can just go grab a day you want.

816
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,700
And if you would like to make a repo for your own personal use, you

817
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,400
can just use whatever source code control system, you want and just

818
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,300
unzip the contents over your existing directory and check it in.

819
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,100
So you can basically just trivially automate.

820
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,500
The process of having your own repo in any source code control system,

821
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,100
you want.

822
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
Which better Linux debugger programs?

823
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,800
Are you looking forward to?

824
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,600
Well, there's one called like Pro dbg.

825
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,100
I don't know if it's going to come to fruition or not.

826
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,700
But there's that and rad and valve or are partnering to do one.

827
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,600
And I don't know, you know, which of those will come to fruition or

828
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,000
how they'll go or any of that stuff.

829
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,100
But if one of them does and it's good then, you know,

830
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,000
Then that's good Windows 7, doesn't support avx2.

831
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Well, you know most people probably aren't running avx2.

832
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,400
So I don't know that we should use that in our renderer.

833
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,800
But you know, yeah, it's true.

834
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,199
We could we could we can consider that, I don't know.

835
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,900
Is, are you sure there's not some way to get that to work though?

836
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,300
I don't know.

837
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,900
Point being will cross those bridges when we come to it, but at that

838
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,600
would probably be a week reason to upgrade to Windows 8 will send I'll

839
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,800
be the only method down to the D-League.

840
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Any chance of some type of repo, sorry, only I just answered that one.

841
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,600
When a scripting language, we use in the game.

842
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,300
No window capture doesn't capture the right click menu by default,

843
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,200
monitor capture, should capture everything, but I am using monitor

844
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,600
capture, and it doesn't seem too.

845
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,700
I'll see if I can tweak the settings, but it doesn't seem to did.

846
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
I consider doing a Kickstarter for this series?

847
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
I did not.

848
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,200
And the reason was twofold one.

849
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,100
I had no idea.

850
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,500
This many people would be interested in it.

851
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,800
So what I thought was going to have to happen was I was gonna have to

852
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,600
do the stream for six months, end up with a cool game.

853
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,400
At that point.

854
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,100
That was like, you know, still a ways away from being done, but it was

855
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
obviously cool.

856
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,400
And then people go.

857
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,500
Oh, there's this cool game.

858
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,000
I played it and oh, by the way, the whole development was captured so

859
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,500
I can go watch.

860
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,000
To it and learn how it was done.

861
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,600
And that would be how people would get into it.

862
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,900
I didn't realize that people would be so excited about doing it from

863
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,800
the start.

864
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,500
So there was that.

865
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,600
So I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna Kickstart My okay.

866
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,500
Let me kick start this project that you don't even know the game and

867
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,100
I'm going to tell you you want to watch it being made like I don't

868
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
know and and I'm all into low level game development.

869
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,000
I want to teach you all these crazy things and everyone's gonna be

870
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
like, I just want to make a game in unity, like or whatever, right?

871
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,800
So, you know, I

872
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,500
I didn't know.

873
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,700
So I didn't do a Kickstarter for that reason, but the second reason

874
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,400
was also I just kind of wanted to do this as a project and I felt

875
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,700
really strongly about it.

876
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,400
In fact, so strongly that I did it expecting that.

877
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,700
No one would watch it for six months.

878
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,000
And because I felt so strongly about it.

879
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,600
I didn't really want to do a Kickstarter because I felt like that

880
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,800
would be somewhat disingenuous.

881
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,900
A Kickstarter to me kind of says that I want money due to this project

882
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,100
and and if I don't get the money then I can't do the project or

883
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,600
something.

884
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,500
But the truth is I was going to do this project, whether I got money

885
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,900
or not.

886
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,800
It's like I will pay for it out of pocket off.

887
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
Find a way, you know, I'll consult or do whatever.

888
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,600
I'll make money to support it if I need to.

889
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
But like, I'm going to do this project.

890
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,300
So I felt they would kind of be disingenuous to have a Kickstarter

891
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,300
because it's like I I this product is going to get made and I don't,

892
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,900
you know, expect you to fund it because I'm going to fund it.

893
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,600
The fact that people have been so supportive of it and have been

894
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,700
pre-ordering the source.

895
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,500
A lot of people say just to support the project like they're not even

896
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,700
saying that they want to appear to be in there.

897
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,300
Like I'm just doing, this is Brother products.

898
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,800
Great idea.

899
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,200
Has been amazing.

900
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Like that's so incredibly cool.

901
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,900
It's basically like I got

902
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Kickstarter, you know, backing essentially because people were so

903
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,400
generous and that's amazing.

904
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,100
And honestly just a fact that people did that to makes me so excited

905
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,500
about the stream because I feel like I feel like it's going to go so

906
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:14,800
well.

907
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Now I feel like we're going to get to these milestones and like every

908
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,600
week we're going to have something cool to show and everyone in the

909
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,400
Stream is going to be pumped about it because it's like we spent five.

910
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,000
We only spent five hours on the stream.

911
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,400
We've got this cool thing going, and we spend another five hours.

912
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
I've got this new cool thing in, and every week.

913
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,400
There's going to be a new cool thing.

914
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,300
That everyone was part of and everyone saw every last thing I did.

915
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
I think that's going to be awesome.

916
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,200
And so I'm so excited that all these people are excited about it and

917
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,100
are watching and and want to support it.

918
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,000
It's just awesome.

919
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,700
I'm really psyched.

920
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,100
Quality seems worse today than yesterday.

921
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,400
Is that?

922
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
Because we have more Watchers.

923
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,500
I don't know.

924
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,100
Maybe I need to upgrade my internet connection.

925
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,400
Let me know if the quality degrades over time so we can to do

926
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:55,900
something.

927
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,200
I'd like to suggest an almond milk power for the game.

928
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
Alright that's going in the notes.

929
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,900
There will be a nominal power up in the game period almonds.

930
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,900
Milk powder up done.

931
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,000
Excellent, excellent suggestion.

932
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,200
You could set up a poll to run for the week.

933
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,700
Letting viewers vote on the best time to stream on Fridays.

934
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
We could do that.

935
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,300
That is not a bad idea.

936
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,900
I will write that down as well.

937
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,700
I don't know if I want to do that because the problem too, is that, I

938
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,700
mean, I work during the day and so I might have to keep it to a

939
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,300
regular schedule because I have to kind of schedule my work week to

940
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,500
make it work, but I'll think about that.

941
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,300
What do you think about learning math concepts by reading Wikipedia?

942
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,800
I think it's horrible.

943
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
I don't know why it's so bad.

944
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,200
Wikipedia is a fantastic resource.

945
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
And I love that site.

946
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,900
But any time I try to go there to read math.

947
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,600
It's like the most dense super antiseptic math.

948
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,100
And like, I can't even really learn from their like, I think you have

949
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,900
to already know the math to understand the math on Wikipedia.

950
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,200
You have to basically a real math person.

951
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,700
So, yeah, I wouldn't try to learn math from there.

952
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,100
I'd try to find good books on the particular thing.

953
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,900
You're trying to read trying to learn because Wikipedia is hard, it's

954
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,200
hard.

955
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,500
Let's see.

956
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,500
Is there a significant difference between the normal C code and an API

957
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,300
that we interface with dedicated graphics cards?

958
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,600
I'm sorry.

959
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,300
I don't super understand that starchy pancakes.

960
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,600
Can you be more explicit?

961
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,300
We are all excited that you're doing this in C.

962
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,700
So am I I love see.

963
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,900
There will be a little C++.

964
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,400
We're going to compile as dot CPS.

965
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,600
So they'll be a little C++.

966
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
We will probably use operator overloading and function overloading.

967
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
I also use declare anywhere but that's in c99 as well.

968
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,200
I believe.

969
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,900
So that's not really C++ anymore.

970
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,200
Used to be used to be that see doesn't allow you to declare things

971
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,800
other than at the start of a block.

972
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,400
Let's see.

973
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,900
Would you be planning to get the kickstarter?

974
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,300
As you're done with this half way?

975
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,700
I'm sorry.

976
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,800
I'm not sure what that means.

977
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Ed's one show.

978
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
Let's see.

979
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,800
Orlando Bloom, I definitely purchase Justice brother product, but

980
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,000
there's a frowny face.

981
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,100
Oh.

982
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,100
I'm sorry.

983
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,700
I didn't want you to frown about that.

984
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,300
I hope you will smile.

985
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,500
Oh, I see you damn iPhone keyboard.

986
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,900
You say?

987
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,700
Okay, so maybe that wasn't supposed to be a frowny face.

988
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
That was supposed to be something else.

989
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,200
Okay.

990
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
Hopefully you're happy about pre-ordering.

991
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,700
I guess you actually word.

992
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,300
That's cool.

993
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,500
Let's see, just planting the seed super hand man.

994
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,900
Here of the 3D math and physics.

995
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,500
T-sql.

996
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,100
Ha ha.

997
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,800
Yes, you know, I'm sure that when we get to the end of this, if some

998
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,700
reason people have watched a year or two of streams every night and

999
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,200
somehow, what they

1000
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,500
After that, they're like, you know, what we need is another two years

1001
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,300
of streams.

1002
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,100
You know, what I'll be used to it.

1003
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,600
So I'm totally fine with that and we can do 3D handmade hero after we

1004
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,200
do handmade hero because yeah, I mean honestly, that'd be the right

1005
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,900
time to do it because you need to learn all the if you can't write a

1006
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,100
great 2-D game.

1007
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,700
If you can't read a great to decode base, forget, right in a great 3D

1008
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,400
code base because 3D has a ton more math than a ton, more moving Parts

1009
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,100
in it, right?

1010
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
So the right way to do it.

1011
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Anyway is Right a great 2-D game, then write a great 3D game for sure.

1012
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,800
And so even if we were going to tackle 3D, we would do it this way.

1013
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
Anyway, we just say we're going to do a 2d first and they're going

1014
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,400
through because you gotta learn the 2D before you learn the 3D.

1015
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,300
You've got it because 3D is just a super set basically, so

1016
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Could you consider dropping the framerate a bit?

1017
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
I don't know if we need 60.

1018
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,100
I don't set the frame rate, do I?

1019
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,000
I will I will look into that frame rate.

1020
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,500
Setting, if I set it.

1021
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,400
I would be happy to drop it to 30 because yes, we don't need 60.

1022
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,900
Let's see.

1023
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,300
While we're at it.

1024
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,100
Let's have a risk.

1025
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Love power up.

1026
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,900
Ha, ha ha, at the risk of giving too much away.

1027
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,700
Well, you know what?

1028
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
I'm not going to give too much away.

1029
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,300
I'm just gonna skip that question for now.

1030
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,200
Can you recommend some good books tutorials know?

1031
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,700
Unfortunately, that is why I even did that intro to see stream as the

1032
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,500
test dream was like, I don't even know where to point people.

1033
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
To learn, see the original K.

1034
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,400
In our book.

1035
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,300
The C programming language is probably the right place to learn it.

1036
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,500
But like, I made the intro stream because I was like, you know, what?

1037
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,300
If people don't know any see at all, you know, they only know, like

1038
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,100
JavaScript or Java or something, or python.

1039
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,000
I'm like, I don't know what to tell them to use for a prerequisite.

1040
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,100
I'm going to be on the stream going.

1041
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,400
Well, if you don't know what a pointer.

1042
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,500
Is then go read.

1043
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,800
So I did that intro to see stream just so you could kind of see stuff,

1044
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,300
pun intended, you know, that you can kind of go watch the under the

1045
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,400
sea stream and kind of get see, as opposed to the whatever programming

1046
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
language are used to, you know, whatever it is that you know, how to

1047
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,100
make C sharp or whatever.

1048
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,400
And you can just kind of see me go through the basics of it, the

1049
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,500
really, really Basics to kind of bring you up to speed on that.

1050
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,600
So hopefully, that helps but, you know, if I, if people send in good

1051
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,400
references, I can try to post them later, if their turn

1052
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,300
Zhou to the good ones.

1053
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,900
When you did that struct instead of class was because you're calling

1054
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,900
the file CPP instead of c key term 87.

1055
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm not sure I understand what that means.

1056
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,300
Just to be clear.

1057
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,400
I mean, this is the off topic a little bit but it only take a few

1058
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,000
seconds and I planned on doing a long queue a tonight because I

1059
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,300
figured people would have a lot of questions on the very first Dream.

1060
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,800
Even though we're not, even though all we did was set the bit of our

1061
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,900
favorite people would just get the question presses out of the way.

1062
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,200
So struct

1063
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,900
If you define something as basically lets me put some stuff together

1064
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,900
that I want to allocate together in memory base.

1065
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,300
They want to talk about together in memory.

1066
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,300
If I say struct Foo, that just says, I need, you know, covered this

1067
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,400
the interest rate, but that's the space that says I'm going to create

1068
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,200
a new type.

1069
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,100
That is basically a composite of other types, right?

1070
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,800
And they're laid out sequentially in memory X, then y, then Z, but I

1071
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,000
guess the person is asking what's the difference between the class and

1072
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,500
the struct?

1073
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,600
And why do you type one of the other?

1074
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,400
Well, the answer is largely.

1075
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:33,700
It's just

1076
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,500
Just whatever.

1077
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,300
Your convention is in C and C++ class.

1078
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,000
Well, actually, there is no class in C.

1079
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,500
But in C++.

1080
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,600
There is no difference between Class instruct.

1081
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,100
The only difference is whether things default to being private or

1082
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,400
public.

1083
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
So, there's these access control specifiers, which we will never be

1084
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,600
using in this stream called public and private.

1085
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,400
And they basically have to do with who can access the variables.

1086
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,200
You will never see us, do one in this in the Stream.

1087
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,000
So, it's not really relevant to this.

1088
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,800
But basically, the difference is in,

1089
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Struct everything defaults to public.

1090
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,400
So, struct is a is essentially this write struct Foo is the same as

1091
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,500
class food public and by inversely, I guess I should say struct

1092
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,200
through private is the same as class through.

1093
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,300
But there's no other differences.

1094
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:18,500
Really.

1095
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,300
That's really the only main difference between the two things.

1096
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,900
You can freely switch between them.

1097
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,200
They're not actually different in practice.

1098
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,000
The compiler, does the exact same thing with them.

1099
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So it's really just whether it defaults to

1100
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,300
To public or defaults to private.

1101
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
That's it, since I want everything to be public.

1102
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,500
I always type struct.

1103
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,800
If you wanted everything to be private.

1104
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,700
You should type class.

1105
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,200
That's it.

1106
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,100
That's all.

1107
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,000
I guess what I'm wondering is how the implementation of running code

1108
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,400
would change and taking advantage of dedicated graphics as opposed to

1109
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,300
using the GP.

1110
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,800
The CPU will will get there.

1111
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,100
But basically what we do is we write the renderer in such a way that

1112
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,600
all the stuff we want to leverage with.

1113
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,900
The GPU is underneath a certain API barrier and so we can later just

1114
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,200
Vector.

1115
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,100
Those API calls over to the GPU instead of to the CPU.

1116
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,700
Basically.

1117
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,600
That's all we're going to do.

1118
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,800
It's pretty straightforward.

1119
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,400
Actually, you'll see.

1120
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,800
Guitar m87 making structure.

1121
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,400
So yes, you can make instructors instructs.

1122
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,100
There's no difference between a class of a struct.

1123
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,000
Just trust me on that one.

1124
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,900
They're exactly the same.

1125
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,100
It's just whether defaults to public or private girl and of Bloom.

1126
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
I'm happy about pre-ordering.

1127
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,300
Definitely even if the games that crappy, this is going to be awesome

1128
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:25,700
to watch.

1129
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,200
Thank you.

1130
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,500
Okay.

1131
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:26,800
Good.

1132
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,300
It's want to make sure.

1133
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,400
There were no frowny faces.

1134
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Earlier, you told us you're not playing to make the kick starter since

1135
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,600
you don't like the idea of getting crowd funded by something that you

1136
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,100
can't show and work as you go.

1137
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,700
So why not when you're halfway through and show you don't get the

1138
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,600
kickstarter started.

1139
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,300
Okay.

1140
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,000
Well, I don't think I need the kickstarter.

1141
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,900
I like I said, it's got that pre-order button.

1142
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,300
Lots of people, you know, did the pre-ordering?

1143
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,100
I mean, you know, I'm not greedy.

1144
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,600
I don't need a Kickstarter as well.

1145
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,100
If you want to support the project you can click on that and that is

1146
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
great support for me.

1147
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,900
So I don't think I need a kick starter in a

1148
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,300
Listen to it because I think especially also as the game gets cooler

1149
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,800
and cooler, people will just want to preorder the game who aren't even

1150
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,800
watching the series or something.

1151
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
So, you know, I don't know.

1152
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,300
I'm hopeful that we can just fund it through that basically, and that

1153
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,100
will be a reasonable reasonable source of funding for me, doing the

1154
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,700
project and me paying the artist to do art, for the project, and

1155
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,400
Licensing, the music.

1156
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,600
And so on, if it turns out that I'm broke and I can't then sure.

1157
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,400
You know, I'll go to Kickstarter and ask for money, but, you know,

1158
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,100
until then.

1159
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,500
I'd like to just go with the pre-orders and see if that works.

1160
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
Are you plan to have descriptive names for the YouTube archived

1161
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,700
videos?

1162
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:36,600
Yes.

1163
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,800
Well, names, maybe not.

1164
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
I try to put some things in the description, but I'm going to separate

1165
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,300
them into playlists basically, because like, for example, this one

1166
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,000
might be named because it's just how to set up the build on Windows,

1167
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,300
but then we might take four or five days to do the windows code.

1168
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,900
So, I might make a playlist called, like making the windows code,

1169
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,100
right?

1170
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,700
And whether each of those things will be named.

1171
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,400
I'm not sure, but I'll try.

1172
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,500
Looks like it was already 30 FPS someone earlier was complaining that

1173
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,300
it was 60 FPS.

1174
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:05,500
Sorry.

1175
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:05,800
Oh, yeah.

1176
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:05,900
Okay.

1177
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,300
So we are already 30fps.

1178
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,600
Okay.

1179
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
So there's nothing I can do.

1180
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:08,800
Sorry.

1181
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,700
We're already 30 FPS.

1182
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,200
That's as low as it probably going to go.

1183
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,400
Since you're in the mood to deny saying spoils, what's up with the

1184
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:22,200
handmade hero icon on the twitch page, tell me elaborate more.

1185
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:22,500
What do you mean?

1186
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,500
What's up with it girl?

1187
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,100
And oh, Bloom.

1188
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,000
I learned a lot from the intro streams, even though I programmed in

1189
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,300
CSS for several years and halfway made a game using opengl and all

1190
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,400
that is awesome.

1191
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,100
I'm really glad to hear that.

1192
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,900
That is cool because that's exactly the stuff.

1193
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,800
I want to bring to a stream.

1194
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,900
I want you to see stuff in this dream that you don't see anywhere

1195
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,200
else.

1196
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,800
I want it to be all the kind of minutiae like professional Game Dev

1197
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,900
stuff that people gloss over.

1198
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,000
And more importantly, I also want to show the mistakes, capturing them

1199
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,400
steaks is really important to me.

1200
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,500
I want you to see me mess up and to see how I recover from those

1201
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,800
mess-ups because that's one of the biggest things that gets left out

1202
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,400
of a lot of teaching materials is they just show you the finished

1203
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,800
thing.

1204
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,500
They're like, here's how I think you should write blah, but they

1205
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,300
didn't show you the steps that got you there, you know.

1206
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,900
So if I just show up and say, hey, here's this cool game.

1207
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,400
It's got all these cool features in it.

1208
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,600
And here's how to write it.

1209
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Well, that's not that interesting because you didn't see all the

1210
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:17,900
iterations.

1211
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,300
I had to go through to get that code to that point and that's a huge

1212
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,500
part of game development.

1213
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,400
No, professional game developer sits down and writes the right code

1214
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:25,900
for their game.

1215
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,100
The first time ever never happens.

1216
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,800
The only time that could happen is if you wrote the exact same game

1217
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,300
before.

1218
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,900
So what I really want to show on this stream is me trying things.

1219
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,700
So, okay.

1220
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,700
We want to implement fire.

1221
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,400
Here's how we get to let it fire the first time, but then

1222
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,600
Didn't work as well.

1223
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,200
Because of this.

1224
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,000
It was a little messy.

1225
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I didn't work with this system.

1226
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,500
So we changed the way we did fire and we went through several

1227
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,000
iterations and eventually, you know, down the line.

1228
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,100
We've got a really cool system for handling fire, something, right.

1229
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,500
That's the kind of thing that I really want to show in the Stream

1230
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,500
because I think that's the part that really like kind of levels you up

1231
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:56,900
into a better.

1232
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,500
Developer is knowing how to do those iterations.

1233
00:49:59,500 --> 00:49:59,700
Right.

1234
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,300
And recovering from your failures.

1235
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,800
It's like it's way more important to be able to recover from a failed

1236
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,000
architecture attempt.

1237
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,600
Then it is to get the architecture attempts, right the first time

1238
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,400
because nobody

1239
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,800
ever gets to that point.

1240
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,500
Usually nobody ever gets to the point where they're doing The

1241
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:14,800
Architects.

1242
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:14,900
All right?

1243
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,000
The first time and even if they were that probably means they're not

1244
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,200
really doing that good architecture.

1245
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,600
Because usually every time I write new stuff, I come up with better

1246
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,800
things every time because I learned from the last time and so it's

1247
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,400
always good to just keep iterating.

1248
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,000
Keep be thinking rethinking how you're going to do things.

1249
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,000
Okay, are you going to be ditching pound include Windows, .h?

1250
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,200
Maybe I don't want to give away too many Secrets there.

1251
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,400
Anybody to 23, how often do you need to hit the debugger?

1252
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,700
Do you rely on a lot for your coding style all the time?

1253
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,900
I just run in it so every time I run the program, I alt Tab and I

1254
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:52,800
write it into the debugger.

1255
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,700
How often I actually debug depends on how intricate the code is, and

1256
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,100
how many bugs I got basically,

1257
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,300
Yeah.

1258
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,700
I noticed this new scope to the for Loop in some of the code that ran

1259
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,000
by.

1260
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,300
Why do you Scope the for Loop?

1261
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:13,500
The way you do that is in one of the intro stream qas, if you would

1262
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,200
like to look at it.

1263
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,900
That's your ettore for syntax.

1264
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,200
I'm going to try not to use that.

1265
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,800
Actually on the stream.

1266
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,200
It's Antiquated and it's something that only I ever did.

1267
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,900
It's an anachronism that was for handling, GCC and msv.

1268
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,500
See cross compatibility back in 1996.

1269
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,800
Microtransactions are all the rage need to add a couple of those.

1270
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
I totally agree.

1271
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,600
I would never actually Implement a game with real microtransactions to

1272
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,500
because I think they are a really bad way to treat your players, but I

1273
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
would certainly put in joke microtransactions so we can certainly,

1274
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,300
think about that.

1275
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,500
Let's see with the game.

1276
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,200
F.2d lighting.

1277
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,800
Yes, it will.

1278
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,700
Can you do the whole game with test-driven development?

1279
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:01,200
No, because games are not really very amenable to test driven

1280
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,700
development.

1281
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,300
Some things we will be able to drive by tests.

1282
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,900
But most things we won't because they involve user input.

1283
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,900
And user input is very difficult to do in a test driven way.

1284
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,700
You can do fuzz testing, you can do randomized, input testing and

1285
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,000
those are good ideas, but unit testing is very hard in those

1286
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,700
circumstances.

1287
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,000
Choo choo!

1288
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,900
Will there be an option to pre-order for a friend as a gift?

1289
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,800
I don't know.

1290
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,900
I will ask send owl, they do the order processing and I am not.

1291
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,000
I mean, I'm not a web guy.

1292
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,800
So I don't know how to do half that stuff.

1293
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,400
So I'll ask them and we'll see, are there differences between C

1294
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,700
structs and C++ trucks?

1295
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:37,900
Yes.

1296
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,700
There are C++ trucks.

1297
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,400
Can do everything that C++ can do in a class because like I said,

1298
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,300
they're the same so we can have member functions.

1299
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,200
It can have public-private declarations.

1300
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,400
It can have overloaded.

1301
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,600
Stuff do anything it wants?

1302
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,300
In see, none of that stuff exists so you can't do those things.

1303
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,600
There's no public and private and see, I don't think unless they add

1304
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:02,100
it in c99, there used to be so C++ trucks are have a lot more stuff

1305
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,800
you can do in them than than C structs.

1306
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,100
We won't really be using any of them, but you can if you if you just

1307
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,800
want crazy stuff.

1308
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,800
When does the street behind you turn green?

1309
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,800
Yeah, I need a green screen.

1310
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,300
That's true.

1311
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
We should just hung a green screen up there so I can appear like, I'm

1312
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,900
in some crazy, tropical locale.

1313
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
You're working with artists already.

1314
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,600
But what about sound effects and music.

1315
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,100
Are you going to leave sound alone for long time?

1316
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,700
No sound will come in right away.

1317
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,300
I will record it on my little pocket recorder for sounds for stand-in

1318
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,700
until we have the game, you know, closer to finished.

1319
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:38,000
And we want to ask for final sounds and music.

1320
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,700
I already license.

1321
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,100
So musical go in right away as well.

1322
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,100
As soon as we have sound playing, will have music playing.

1323
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,800
Let's see.

1324
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,400
If you have this much viewers on a regular basis, you'll soon, have a

1325
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,800
subscribe button partnership with twitch which will give you some cash

1326
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,200
to.

1327
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,600
I don't know anything about that.

1328
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,100
I don't understand any of this streaming stuff.

1329
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,600
I only just set it up because it seemed like what people could use.

1330
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,800
And I really want to be able to

1331
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,500
Live.

1332
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,700
I thought that would be a cool thing to be able to do so, I don't know

1333
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,100
anything about twitch subscriptions.

1334
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,500
Since you said, you aren't a game designer, how do you plan to design

1335
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,200
a good game from this?

1336
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,300
Well, basically I'm not, you know, I'm not ignorant of how to design

1337
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:16,800
games.

1338
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,300
Like, I know, I talk to my friends who are excellent game designers

1339
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,200
all the time.

1340
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,000
I understand the things they're talking about.

1341
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,700
I understand the basic mechanics of game design.

1342
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,600
So I will be able to design a traditional game, just fine.

1343
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,500
Like, I'm sure I can handle a game that is not avant-garde, right?

1344
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,500
So I'm not going to

1345
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
And make a game.

1346
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,100
That is like, oh, it's the emotional Journey.

1347
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:45,900
If someone is told Through The Eyes of their pet goldfish, who got

1348
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:51,500
cancer recently and had to go to a thing, but it's really a dream

1349
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,000
sequence.

1350
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,700
And at the end you realize something about, you know, your sexuality

1351
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,000
or something like those are like super Advanced game, designing sorts

1352
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,400
of things that people are doing nowadays where they're like trying to

1353
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,500
talk about like basically doing more.

1354
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,200
Or high-concept stuff in games.

1355
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,300
And I don't have the skill set at all to do any of that stuff.

1356
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,500
Like, I'm not good at it, and I don't really know how to do that sort

1357
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:14,900
of stuff.

1358
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,400
So, if you want me to design like a game, that's different from

1359
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,100
traditionally.

1360
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,400
How games have worked.

1361
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,500
That's really not something that I'm going to be able to do.

1362
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,000
Right?

1363
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,100
So I'm intentionally staying away from that.

1364
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Our design will be very, very traditional.

1365
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,300
It will be a game where, you know, you go off on an adventure where

1366
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,900
there are monsters who try to stop you.

1367
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,800
You know, you adventure around and find cool things that is, you know,

1368
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,100
the extent of the high concept for this game.

1369
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,400
So it will be more like, you know, you were playing an old-school

1370
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,400
console game with the old little paddles, where there weren't like

1371
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,700
cutscenes trying to tell like a story to you or things like that.

1372
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,800
So so that's basically what I mean by the game design.

1373
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,500
So I am not a professional game designer and I don't want to take on

1374
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,100
the responsibility of trying to show how to make a new great game

1375
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,400
design that no one's ever done.

1376
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,800
Before because I just don't have the qualifications for that.

1377
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,100
I would love to see someone do that stream.

1378
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,200
I am very interested in new types of games.

1379
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,900
I like it.

1380
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,500
When people like, I really liked, you know, saying like I like to

1381
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,300
start Steed starseed Pilgrim.

1382
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,800
A lot.

1383
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,100
It was pretty cool.

1384
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,800
And, you know, I really like kind of wacky games and stuff like that,

1385
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,300
that are that do interesting things.

1386
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,700
So, I would love if people made streams where they talking design

1387
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,500
because I could learn from that, but I can't do that.

1388
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,800
That like I don't have the capability that.

1389
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,100
So,

1390
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,400
let's see.

1391
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,200
You probably already answered this, but why start from scratch versus

1392
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:54,800
using an engine?

1393
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,900
Why reinvent the wheel?

1394
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,800
It's a good question and the answer is twofold.

1395
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,900
One is

1396
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,500
Because I think it's important for game developers who are going to be

1397
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:08,400
serious, programmers to learn everything about how a game works.

1398
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,500
And if you start with an engine, then it it basically changes.

1399
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,900
What you're learning from the fundamental truth of how to implement a

1400
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,100
game to someone else's version of that.

1401
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,100
They have basically gone from what the actual game code actually does.

1402
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,600
And put a big old giant layer in between you and that.

1403
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,800
So now, what you're really learning is that

1404
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Engine you haven't learned how to make games, you've learned how to

1405
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,300
make games in unity, right?

1406
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,900
And if Unity were to disappear, for example, you would no longer know

1407
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,000
how to make a game at all.

1408
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,000
I'm not exaggerating this.

1409
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,800
That's just the truth.

1410
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,700
And so while there's nothing wrong with making games in engines,

1411
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,000
because that may be the most efficient way for you to make the thing

1412
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
that you want to make.

1413
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,100
I don't think you can have a complete game development education as a

1414
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,900
programmer without learning how everything works, right down to the

1415
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,000
core principles that have been.

1416
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,200
True for the past several decades.

1417
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,800
That's how a CPU runs a game.

1418
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,900
And so I think those are essential to learn and I wanted to show them.

1419
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,300
So if people want to use engines, that's totally fine, but that is the

1420
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,000
opposite of what I'm trying to show here.

1421
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,800
I want to show how all that stuff works.

1422
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:22,700
And I want to give people the ability to make their own engine stuff

1423
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,800
as necessary as well, because even if you go use an engine like unreal

1424
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,800
or something, to make a game knowing how all of it.

1425
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,300
It works underneath.

1426
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,600
Makes you so much more powerful even in that engine because now, it

1427
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,900
means you don't just have to look at the Docks and guess how the thing

1428
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,800
kind of doing it.

1429
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,400
You know, how the Thing Really Works and so you can go.

1430
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:49,300
Oh, I know there must be a way for unreal to do x y z because I know

1431
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,400
that's how the CPU works.

1432
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,600
And I know it can do it.

1433
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,300
So let me go find how to do that or white my own plug-in that can do

1434
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,000
that for me.

1435
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,700
And now you're so much more powerful.

1436
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,400
You don't have to be like hamstrung by the things that they allowed

1437
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:01,900
you to do.

1438
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,200
In that sort of layer, right?

1439
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,400
So it's empowering.

1440
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,200
It's educational.

1441
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,000
That's all good.

1442
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,400
But the second thing I wanted to point out is saying reinvent, the

1443
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,200
wheel is a very misleading statement.

1444
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,700
And it always bothers me a little bit.

1445
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:19,900
When people say things like, why reinvent the wheel and the reason is

1446
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,500
because the wheel is an amazing invention.

1447
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:29,400
It is almost perfect or even possibly perfect for what it does.

1448
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,200
When you look at a wheel, it is the thing that perfectly turns,

1449
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,100
Dynamic friction into static friction for moving objects, right?

1450
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,900
It's something that is so elegant and beautiful.

1451
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,000
That, if you ask me, why you would want to

1452
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,400
That I would say, of course.

1453
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,600
You don't want to reinvent the wheel.

1454
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,000
The wheel is amazing.

1455
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,400
It is worked for thousands of years.

1456
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,000
It has been unchanged for thousands of years.

1457
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,100
The concept is the same today as it was when they first made a wheel,

1458
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:57,900
probably, right.

1459
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,800
It does exactly the same stuff physically.

1460
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,400
Nothing, we have developed in the past 30 years of game development is

1461
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,100
a wheel.

1462
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:11,000
We do not have a single wheel if you think Unity is a wheel or you

1463
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,200
think unreal is a wheel that is just it's just plain short-sighted.

1464
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,900
Like I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

1465
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,600
In the future.

1466
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,000
We will have so much more powerful tools for game development.

1467
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,900
That they will make the engines we use today.

1468
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:26,800
Look like a joke.

1469
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,400
People will laugh at the things that we did to make games today.

1470
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,500
And the reason that I point that out is not to diss on those things

1471
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,300
because they are the best engines we have today.

1472
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,500
So yes, if you need to use an engine you want to use some of these

1473
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,600
things, right?

1474
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,300
But I want to point out the fact that if we want to get to a real

1475
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,600
wheel that when you really do say to me, why would you reinvent the

1476
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:47,800
wheel?

1477
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,400
I would say, you shouldn't use the wheel if we want to get to that

1478
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:51,600
wheel.

1479
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:56,000
We need people making new things that attempt to be a wheel and you

1480
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,500
can't do that.

1481
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,000
If all, you know, how to do is program stuff in unreal or Unity

1482
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,900
because that's all you get.

1483
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,300
That's the

1484
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,600
Square wheel, right?

1485
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,200
That's kind of clunking around.

1486
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,200
And if all you're ever gonna do is build cars on top of that.

1487
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,000
They're going to be lousy, right?

1488
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,700
Unless you're driving on a road that looks like this.

1489
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,100
So basically what I want to inspire to as part of the series, if I

1490
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,500
can, as I want people to look at this and go, hey, wait a minute,

1491
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:20,300
low-level game.

1492
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,500
Programming is not that hard.

1493
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,500
I saw him do it.

1494
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:26,100
I saw how he did it and I'm starting to understand this, I could go do

1495
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,400
this and if they get into it and get excited about it, then they may

1496
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,300
be the people who make

1497
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:37,100
make those next engines that allow a whole new wave of game

1498
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,200
development to happen.

1499
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,200
Just like Unity allowed.

1500
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,400
So many more people to make games who didn't have that knowledge,

1501
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,700
who's going to be making those things of the future, right?

1502
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:51,400
And so that's why I think Lil program is so important is because we

1503
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,100
need lots of people with those, with those talents and those skills to

1504
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:59,500
get us to the point where it really is silly to be working on anymore,

1505
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,200
but we are so far from there.

1506
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:01,800
Me.

1507
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,600
Let's see.

1508
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,900
Stream is going to happen every weekday at the same time.

1509
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,500
It can you name a subreddit?

1510
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,100
Can you name the subreddit as the official Community Hub are set up?

1511
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:19,900
An official Forum?

1512
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:26,000
I so if you have a good idea of how to do an official Forum, you are

1513
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,300
welcome to email me.

1514
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,600
I was trying to figure out how maybe that should happen, but I

1515
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,700
couldn't figure out a good place.

1516
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,300
I could maybe pay to host it or something where it wouldn't just get

1517
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,100
all spammed up.

1518
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,600
I've had bad experiences with forums where they take a lot of

1519
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,800
Maintenance work and spammers start registering on them and stuff like

1520
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:41,900
that.

1521
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:45,400
And so, if there really is a way to set up a reliable Forum that

1522
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,100
people can use that.

1523
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,300
Don't get all spammy.

1524
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,100
Please email me.

1525
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,800
You can use the the button on the on the handmade.

1526
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,500
He rode up or website and email me because I would be interested in

1527
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,900
setting up before arm eventually.

1528
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:57,300
Yes.

1529
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,000
Let's see to all the people who are saying, thank you and saying that

1530
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,600
they learned more in their University.

1531
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,200
Thank you.

1532
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,300
Thank you for turning it tuning in teaching is very important to me.

1533
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,300
I love doing it.

1534
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,900
I love explaining things.

1535
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,600
It's a lot of fun and the fact that people are are listening to it and

1536
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,500
getting something from, it makes it so much more rewarding for me.

1537
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,800
Like I really can't.

1538
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,400
Thank you enough.

1539
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,000
So thank you very much for tuning in.

1540
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,200
I really appreciate it.

1541
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,600
You do not need to thank me.

1542
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,300
I am having a blast and just the knowledge that people are starting to

1543
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,900
see this stuff and get into, it is everything that I wanted to have

1544
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,300
happen.

1545
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,700
So like this you are making this series as a success before it has

1546
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:47,500
even gotten off the ground and and for that, I am so grateful.

1547
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,100
So, yes, thank you.

1548
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,400
Thank you very much to all of you.

1549
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,800
Let's see.

1550
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,500
Do do do, do do.

1551
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,300
Can you explain your choice to mix and C++?

1552
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,700
Why not code with just see or pure C++.

1553
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,200
I'm not sure.

1554
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,300
What pure C++ is, since C++ is just see with stuff added on top of it.

1555
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,600
So there's really no such thing as pure C++.

1556
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:23,600
Obviously there is such a thing as pure C, which is just C or C 99

1557
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,200
without any of the C++ editions.

1558
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,600
The reason that I didn't want to do that is because there are some

1559
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,800
features of C++ that I like such as operator overloading.

1560
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,700
Math and function, overloading.

1561
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,500
I like those too.

1562
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,800
I use them fairly frequently and I don't see a really good reason not

1563
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,900
to use them especially because, if one were writing a compiler to

1564
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:49,400
compile handmade hero, they don't take much effort to support.

1565
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,700
So if you were trying to write a compiler from scratch, that can

1566
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,500
compile handmade hero, which is a project that I would love to do it

1567
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,900
in the future and maybe that'll be some kind of separate stream as

1568
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:58,200
well.

1569
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,000
Or you know, who knows?

1570
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,400
Maybe, I'll tie into what John's doing.

1571
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,800
For example, if

1572
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,000
Those of you who have been keeping up with Jonathan blows making a new

1573
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,500
language, which is super awesome.

1574
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,700
You know, basically, I didn't feel like those features would be

1575
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,000
additional think if I started using like templates and stuff like

1576
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,400
that.

1577
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,600
Those start to add a lot of complexity to your language.

1578
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,800
And so there are, you know, you could see why if you really wanted to

1579
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,600
use those, you might say.

1580
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,800
Oh, maybe I won't use those because it will keep it simpler.

1581
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,000
But overloaded operators are overloaded functions are really easy to

1582
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,200
implement in a language if you've already implemented the basics of

1583
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,800
see that you need to compile it, so I didn't see any reason to

1584
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,100
To gopura see because I'm not sure what the benefit would be all C

1585
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,100
compilers or C++ compilers at this point.

1586
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,400
So it's you know, llvm which is what we'll be using on the other

1587
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,000
platforms.

1588
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,000
You know, it's way better than visual studio.

1589
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,400
So visual studios are our Baseline for C++ compliance and it's way

1590
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
more than what we need.

1591
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,400
So I figured just compiling and CPP was better in general because it

1592
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,900
meant that we could use some of those extra features without actually

1593
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:56,200
incurring any complexity for people who want to play with the source

1594
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,500
code later in a way that would require require them to be able to

1595
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,200
parse it.

1596
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,500
In handle Advanced features.

1597
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,800
Are you a tool that converts almond milk into code on the stream?

1598
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:13,200
I am I don't actually I actually convert Almond Roca two streams.

1599
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,100
Normally during the day.

1600
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,400
I do drink almond milk out of these same bottles like this, but I

1601
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,600
drink it much less frequently.

1602
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,200
The reason I do it here is to keep my voice from going.

1603
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,200
It just helps me not get laryngitis on the stream, basically.

1604
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,400
Is there a Game Dev company that you really admire?

1605
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,900
In other words being how you think makes great games the right way.

1606
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:37,900
If not, do you have at least a favorite game?

1607
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,000
I don't know.

1608
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,800
I mean, you know, I haven't worked at many game companies.

1609
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,200
Really.

1610
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,500
I mean, I worked at rad for a long time.

1611
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,900
That's a game tools company.

1612
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,400
I'd like rad.

1613
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,200
I mean, they're good company.

1614
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,800
That's why I worked for them for so long.

1615
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,000
So they're a good company, but for game companies, I don't know.

1616
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,200
I'm not really a position to say.

1617
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,600
I have to go work at a lot of different.

1618
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,900
Bunnies and really judge their prosthesis, I guess.

1619
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,700
But also the other thing is

1620
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,400
developing games.

1621
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,000
The right way is just developing games that ship reliably and aren't

1622
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,100
buggy and are performing.

1623
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,600
Well, you know, I mean, I mean the proof is always in the pudding.

1624
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,000
So anyone has been out any companies without their in a shipping

1625
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,800
games, reliably is doing something right.

1626
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,000
And that's an important thing to keep in mind, you know, a lot of

1627
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,800
people get hung up on sort of demagoguery and like what's the right

1628
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,200
way to do this and the right way to do that.

1629
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,700
Well, the right way is the way that gets things done efficiently.

1630
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:36,700
It's on time as possible, you know in a way

1631
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,400
To keeps people's morale up, you know, if you can if you can get that

1632
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,800
to work, then you're doing something right?

1633
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,400
And so I'm not really in a position to say one way or the other and

1634
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,700
especially since I tend to do my own projects, a lot of the time, I

1635
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,700
don't know a lot about working with large teams or that sort of stuff,

1636
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,000
because that's a whole another complexity, right there.

1637
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,400
There's a lot of communication things that have to happen there and

1638
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,100
stuff that has nothing to do with the code.

1639
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,500
So yeah, so I would say I don't really have much of an answer for you.

1640
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,200
I apologize.

1641
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,300
Let's see.

1642
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,000
I think we're getting to the end of the questions.

1643
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,500
From your point of view.

1644
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,000
Where do you think most of your viewers come from?

1645
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,500
I have no idea.

1646
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,899
I have no idea.

1647
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,399
I suspect that that

1648
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,800
Some of the retweets that I got helped a lot like Jonathan Blow

1649
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,200
retreated me and a lot of you know, game developers follow him.

1650
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:42,300
Obviously some buddy from like somebody with like 300,000 followers.

1651
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,000
Retweeted me.

1652
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:46,899
They were someone who was, like an author, something who I didn't

1653
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:50,300
know, but retweeted me apparently like some kind of O'Reilly

1654
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,300
newsletter, had it Hacker News had it.

1655
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,600
So I feel like maybe just people were getting the message out because

1656
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,899
I guess they, they like,

1657
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
You know, they were excited about the concept.

1658
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,100
We're like getting the word out, and I guess that just cast a wide

1659
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,300
enough net, that a lot of people decided to come check out the series.

1660
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,500
I don't know anything more than that.

1661
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,899
I one of the things that I'm intentionally not doing.

1662
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,800
He's, I try very hard, not to look at how many people have

1663
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,600
pre-ordered, I try very hard.

1664
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,600
Not to look at any statistics.

1665
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,100
I don't even collect statistics on the website of any kind.

1666
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,399
No analytics.

1667
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:25,800
I don't even keep a weblog.

1668
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,399
And the reason for that is because I just want to do this stream

1669
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:29,899
because I'm

1670
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,899
Excited about doing the code and teaching it.

1671
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,300
And I feel like if I start trying to think about like am I reaching an

1672
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,600
audience and how do I get more viewers and all stuff than that's like,

1673
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,800
It turns it into some kind of bad social media thing for me and I

1674
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,899
don't want to do that.

1675
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:50,800
So yeah, so I can't give a very good answer because I really don't

1676
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,200
know.

1677
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,899
And basically I just see what I see on the Twitter stream and that's

1678
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:54,600
all I really know.

1679
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,200
And I don't really want to go find out because I'm afraid that it'll

1680
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,700
start to ruin it a little bit for me.

1681
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,200
If I try to start thinking about this as trying to be some kind of Web

1682
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,400
2.0, popularity thing instead of just doing it because it's, you know,

1683
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,300
awesome to code.

1684
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,400
And I want to share that with people.

1685
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,700
I'm trying, I really want to keep that genuineness as much and as long

1686
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:19,200
as possible, and part of that kind of, unfortunately, means I'm going

1687
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:25,200
to remain fairly ignorant about, even who is watching, let alone how

1688
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,300
they found out about it.

1689
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,800
Sdl versus S FML.

1690
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,200
I do not know what that means.

1691
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,100
Is that simple, directmedia layer.

1692
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:36,800
I like that.

1693
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,100
Matt Cornell has beep.

1694
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,800
The mega timer.

1695
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,300
This is a very long Q&A session.

1696
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:42,300
They often won't be that long way since this was the first Dream.

1697
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:43,500
I want to do an extra long one.

1698
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,000
So you're right.

1699
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,900
It is Mega timer.

1700
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,400
Let's see.

1701
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:53,400
Looks like we are basically done.

1702
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:57,300
I'm at the end of the twitch questions, of course, there's a lag but

1703
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,400
at some point I got to call it.

1704
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,900
So it's 10:30.

1705
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,300
We've gone like a full hour of QA basically a little more than an hour

1706
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,400
even so thank you so much for staying for the Q&A.

1707
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:12,300
I really hope that even though today's was not the most exciting part

1708
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,900
certainly of this series that you are excited enough to come.

1709
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,200
Tomorrow and see us get our window up in our rendering started, which

1710
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,600
is what we will be doing tomorrow.

1711
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:28,500
So if you, if you are in the mood for some more, handmade hero, 8 p.m.

1712
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,300
PST, tomorrow, I will be right here, casting.

1713
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,700
We usually start between 15 and 30 minutes early.

1714
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,100
We don't actually do any of the stream of that time, but I, you know,

1715
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:42,100
usually have the stream up and you know, I'll talk to people on the

1716
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,400
chat.

1717
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,800
So if you just want to chat or something will be there and we kind of

1718
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,700
Let people sort of filter in at that point.

1719
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:50,700
So if you want to come a little early you can catch that.

1720
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,200
Otherwise, I will see you at 8:00 p.m.

1721
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:52,700
Tomorrow.

1722
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:57,000
Thank you so much for everyone for tuning in and and have a great rest

1723
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,800
of your evening.
