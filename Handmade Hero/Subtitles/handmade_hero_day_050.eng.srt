00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,300
Alright, hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
The show where we code an entire game from scratch live on Twitch

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,200
know, libraries, no engines.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,200
So we can see, absolutely everything that has to go on to make a game

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,800
actually work.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,400
And there's a fantastic amount of stuff in there that has to go on to

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,900
make a game work and it can be really fascinating to kind of get in

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,700
there and see all the all the stuff that happens.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,100
I think.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,500
Anyway, it's it's really interesting to me and I hope it's interesting

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,200
to you as well.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
We are on day 50 right now and we are just about to finish up the sort

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,300
of collision detection.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,600
If that we were doing basically what we're in the middle of right now

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,700
is a pass over the code at the beginning where we're basically

16
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,100
spec'ing out everything that we want in our engine.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,600
So we're doing basically crappy versions of all of the things that we

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,300
think we will need to make the game Run properly so that we have some

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,900
functional skeleton in place that we can look at and go.

20
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,500
Okay.

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
We see how everything works together.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
We see what the requirements basically are for each thing.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,500
Now, when we go do industrial-strength versions of each of these

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,600
pieces of code, first of all, we have the other pieces of code in

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,200
place working, if albeit, Janka lie, which is kind of important, so we

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,800
can see how things work together as we make new components.

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,600
But also its so that when we go off and make a new component and we're

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,700
trying to do a like a good high quality version of it.

29
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,900
We're not doing that in a vacuum because when you do when you do stuff

30
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,000
like that in a vacuum, you tend to make a lot of mistakes in terms of

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,100
how it will interface with other things.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
And you forget certain requirements that

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,100
Maybe you wouldn't have thought of if you hadn't have looked at the

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,200
usage code first.

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,600
So always write the usage code.

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
First big, big Mantra of mine.

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
And and that is exactly what we're doing.

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,300
We've gotten to the point where we have a question sector that

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,700
basically, actually already works.

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,600
It works better than I thought it was going to work.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,500
I thought this version was going to be jankier.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,000
That was but it's not at the moment, but that's okay.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Because we still have a feature to add to it anyway, so I'm going to

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,900
do a little bit more on the closure before we put it to bed and say,

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,000
okay everything else is going to happen with questions, directions,

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,200
going to

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,800
And when we do the, the final version of it, but there is one more

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,900
thing that I want to do because I think it's relatively important to

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,000
have something like it in place, and that is basically area-based

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,400
questions doctor.

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,700
So, we'll talk about that in a second for now.

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,200
If you are one of the fine fellows who has pre-ordered handmade hero

53
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,200
from him a hero dot-org, you will note that today.

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,600
We are on day 50, which means that if you download the source code

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,000
that comes with the game from last night's post day, 49 source code is

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,300
in there unzipped.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Day 49 zip into a directory and you'll be right where I am today.

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
So if you want to follow along that is the day to use.

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, let's get started here.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,100
Let's take a look at where we were so we did some debugging.

61
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,700
Yesterday.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,900
Our Collision sector is now unfortunately, more solid than I would

63
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,800
have wanted it to be.

64
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,300
So we basically have two things to do today.

65
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
One is that we have to actually do gliding now.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
Like we want to be able to Glide along edges, instead of stop.

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,900
And the other is I would

68
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
To have area-based question section, you'll notice that it's just

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
point basically induction right now.

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
It's that point at the base of his feet so he can kind of go into

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,000
objects lately, which we don't want either.

72
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,400
So our base is just going to fix those two things today.

73
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,700
That's our primary goal.

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,400
The first one is probably a little harder than the second one in terms

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,200
conceptually because we already did what I already talked about the

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,300
math behind the skating.

77
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,000
So you kind of already know what we're going to do there.

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,900
And so right now all we really need to talk about is is how we're

79
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,200
going to do that sort of that area based stuff.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
And so, I guess, what I'll do is I'll start off with that because in

81
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,900
case that takes the whole time, we can always do skating on Monday.

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,700
And the skating is like I said, we were talking about the mass, so

83
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,300
it's not going to be as big of as big of an investment.

84
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,100
So let's talk about what's going on here, over on the Whiteboard, or

85
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
as we would might call the tan board.

86
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,800
So as it kinda looks like a chalkboard now, so what we were doing,

87
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,200
right?

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,100
The way we Implement our Collision Vector is we wanted to start doing

89
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,800
Collision detection, where we knew when we would hit a wall in

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Of just taking a point that we were, at a point that we were trying to

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,300
go to over one time step, right?

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,400
This is one time, step one frame and saying is this inside something

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,900
or not?

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Right?

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,400
And when we did that, that was problematic because it meant that we

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,500
couldn't do skating.

97
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Like we would want to do and there's a bunch of other problems that we

98
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,200
were going to have that like tunneling.

99
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
There are, there are problems with doing it this way.

100
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,500
So what we decided to do was switch to a method, where we actually

101
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,700
solve for the time at which we would hit something.

102
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
So we solve for that intersection point.

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,800
So now we know,

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,300
Between the two points.

105
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,000
We actually check all if the any Collision could have happened along

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
there, right?

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,500
But in order to do that, we made a simplifying assumption, which is we

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,000
simplify it down to checking a line versus whatever the shape is that

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,200
we were Collision testing against?

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,700
In this case.

111
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,400
We were too close and talking against four walls of a tile.

112
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,200
And in that simplification down to a line, obviously that means that

113
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,300
the person that that little fellow in there, he doesn't have any area

114
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,700
at all.

115
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,200
He's just a point, right?

116
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,700
He's a point moving along a line.

117
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
That's all we're testing.

118
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,800
So we need to do is now talk about how to make him a little bigger.

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,400
And I'm going to use the simplification in that.

120
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,000
We're just going to make him rectangular because that's going to make

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,700
it easier for us to implement because we're not doing the file

122
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,800
conjecture now, but

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,300
I'm going to talk about is actually going to be the same, the actual

124
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,800
theory behind it is the same no matter what shape he is.

125
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
And so I'm going to talk about him as if he was a circle as well and

126
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,800
stuff like that.

127
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,100
Just so that you understand, that conceptually the way that we're

128
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,300
thinking about, this actually doesn't matter, but implementation wise,

129
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,900
you have to step up to slightly stronger algorithms, if you want to

130
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,000
use dissimilar shapes and I'll explain why in a second.

131
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,200
So what we're doing here is we're going to talk about something called

132
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,400
the minkowski sum.

133
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Also, the minkowski difference.

134
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,900
And what's interesting about this?

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,700
Is that like minkowski algebra?

136
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,700
There's there's like Mankowski was probably a pretty cool dude.

137
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,900
I don't really know anything about him, but I suspect that.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,200
Actually has a lot to say about a lot of things and unfortunately, I

139
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,800
am one of those people who only learned enough about what he did to do

140
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Collision detection.

141
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,800
So really, it's one of those things that's like on the bucket list.

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,300
I would love to go read all and actually really understand all of his

143
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,700
algebra stuff and how he worked with shapes and everything because I

144
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,900
suspect that there's probably some really cool stuff that I could do

145
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,800
if I understood it.

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,000
And I don't, I don't I never learn enough of it to really know.

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:29,800
So I

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,500
Going to tell you what is basically, the game version of Mankowski,

149
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,400
some indifference, which is the stuff.

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,900
We need to know about the work he did.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Oh my, I'm losing.

152
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
My voice is going to be a Gravely one.

153
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Which is the stuff we need to know about what he did to basically do

154
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,100
what we need to do for Collision detection.

155
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay, so essentially what you could think about it is imagine I had

156
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,300
two walls with a gap between them.

157
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay.

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,500
And these walls each have.

159
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,800
Let's say if we took their Center, I guess it's hard to call it

160
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,000
necessarily a radius because it's not a circle but imagine there's

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,500
like a radius which basically says, you know, how the dimension here,

162
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,100
right?

163
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,800
They have a dimension of something and we'll call that will call that

164
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
I don't know s for now.

165
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,900
Okay.

166
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,800
So basically these walls have a dimension of s so they are to S this

167
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
way and to S this way they're squares.

168
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's say okay and then I've got my guy.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,700
Right, and I've got my guy here and he lets say has a radius of our,

170
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,900
so he's to our this way to our that way.

171
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,800
And when I do my Collision detection, what I want to do is I want to

172
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
drive him through here.

173
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,900
Right?

174
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,300
And we can see just intuitively that he's too large to fit.

175
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,100
So there's no way that you're going to fit this, this opening is less

176
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
than two are, right.

177
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,900
So there's no way he should be able to fit through here.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,800
But obviously, if we were doing Collision detection, the way I talked

179
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,100
about doing it in a simpler form, when I was teaching how to do that,

180
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
basic line intersection.

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,900
Well, if he shrinks down to a point, he'd fit through there.

182
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,400
No problem.

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,500
We can easily pass raised through there.

184
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,300
There's tons of raise that would pass straight on through there and

185
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,200
not have a problem.

186
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,000
So the question is, what could we do?

187
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
That would make it so that we could still do Collision detection,

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,800
continuously along a ray like that along a line, so that we actually

189
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
get analytic and we know we don't tunnel through anything.

190
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,900
What would we do to do that?

191
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,600
So that we could still solve it with a guy who had an actual size to

192
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,000
it and not just a point.

193
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,200
And so the interesting answer from Mankowski is that you can actually

194
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
do a form of algebra on shapes.

195
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,000
So in much, the same way that you might imagine having something like

196
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,800
a plus b equals c, write an equation like you would learn in high.

197
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,900
Algebra, or even earlier, you could imagine saying?

198
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,800
Oh, well, if I want to talk just about a I can move the B to the other

199
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,500
side and say it's a equals c minus B, right?

200
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,300
And, and these are two ways of writing the same thing.

201
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,600
That's really handy.

202
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:18,900
Right?

203
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,800
Because this allows us even just those basic operations allow us.

204
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
To do a lot of things.

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,100
We've already used that a ton of times in all the code that we've

206
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,700
written just so far in the game and will use it, a ton more algebra,

207
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,400
just really handy.

208
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Those.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Operations of being able to move things to either side and and talk

210
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
about what a particular variable equals.

211
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
If you have some kind of hairy equation over here.

212
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,400
It's pretty cool.

213
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,700
Right?

214
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,800
And it's very powerful.

215
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,200
Well, we can actually do stuff like that with shapes as well.

216
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,400
What we can do, if we essentially think of this as being a point,

217
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:50,900
Right?

218
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,800
That has this radius here and that radius is what gives its volume.

219
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,900
Instead of thinking this as a half and to cast, right?

220
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
Like what we would do, if we wanted to do this intersection instead of

221
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,600
thinking as having to sweep, essentially this whole Square through

222
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,500
here and actually do testing to see whether we overlap with these

223
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,100
pieces.

224
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,700
What we can do instead is say let's pretend that we did shrink this

225
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
guy down to a point.

226
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,700
What would we have to do to these shapes to make it.

227
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,900
So that a point moving through them behaves, the same way as a

228
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,700
rectangle would move through the the unmodified shapes and the answer

229
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,600
is actually very simple.

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,100
It's just we would have to grow these shapes by this shape.

231
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,300
So essentially what you can imagine is taking the perimeter of this

232
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,700
shape and sweeping this rectangle around it, right?

233
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,700
So you imagine sweeping this rectangle all around it and we would end

234
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:51,800
up

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,000
But the shape that was like this, right?

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,100
And you imagine me doing that here as well.

237
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,200
Sweeping that taking this rectangle and sweeping it all around the

238
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,900
outside and taking that outer boundary, right?

239
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,700
And now we produce two new shapes, right?

240
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,100
That actually, if you can see, you can actually see intuitively what

241
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,400
it is.

242
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,800
It's s+ R.

243
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,200
They're rectangles that are S Plus R from the center out, instead of

244
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
just s.

245
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,400
We now have two shapes that if we're a cast, it against them would

246
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,700
give us.

247
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,500
The right result.

248
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,200
You can no longer pass through there, and you can see that actually,

249
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
as our get smaller.

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,500
If our was like that small, they would have still left a gap that we

251
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,700
could still pass through, which is correct.

252
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,400
So as our crosses, the threshold of how big our would have to be to

253
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,000
fit through here, it creates a gap or doesn't create a gap based on

254
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,500
that.

255
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,900
So what the Mankowski that's called the minkowski sum there.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Excuse me.

257
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,900
I believe technically this term.

258
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,000
Is sort of.

259
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Not even a real.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
ERM.

261
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,000
I think it's usually just considered a some and you're either doing

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
the some of the negative or not.

263
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't know that it's a little odd but minkowski sum is the name for

264
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,800
that.

265
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,000
So where does that leave us?

266
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,500
Right?

267
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,900
What is that actually do for us?

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,600
Functionally.

269
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,100
Well, if you think about Oak Rita, here it comes.

270
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,900
Look at that.

271
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh, but it didn't.

272
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Well, I didn't use my background.

273
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,500
What, what, guys what's going on with that?

274
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,500
It's supposed to clear.

275
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,400
It's supposed to clear to my background color, right?

276
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
You saw it happen, didn't you?

277
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,200
You saw that happen?

278
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,200
Why did I get?

279
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,300
Why did I get jumped?

280
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,400
All right.

281
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Hold on a second.

282
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,100
Can I fill this with something kind?

283
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,800
Do anything?

284
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,200
Phil.

285
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,100
It's going on here, Phil.

286
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,600
What?

287
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,800
Okay, seriously, this is just absurd you guys saw that happen, right?

288
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,600
And now I can't seem to undo.

289
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
Why can't I undo?

290
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,300
This program is fired.

291
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,100
I don't even know what it's doing at this point.

292
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,700
I feel like it shouldn't be that hard to just have a thing that draws.

293
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:20,900
Okay.

294
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,500
There we go.

295
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,900
Well, that was disappointing That was supposed to be the big moment

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,900
and the big moment was totally flaccid, is basically what happened.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
So, how do we, how do we clear?

298
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,200
This thing?

299
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,600
There's got to be some way to select stuff, right?

300
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,900
How do I select just a region in this program?

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,300
Because that select a region.

302
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
That looks like a drew a rectangle there.

303
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,700
That's Alexa region.

304
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,400
So, if I select this region, right, I feel like I should be able to

305
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,000
clear it.

306
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Can I not clear it?

307
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,700
Clear.

308
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,100
I don't know.

309
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,300
How about fill with foreground color?

310
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,400
I can't fill with her.

311
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,100
All right, guys, seriously, this is just ridiculous, unacceptable

312
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,800
behavior.

313
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,500
On the point of the drawing program Uhn acceptable.

314
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,000
It's my opinion.

315
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,900
How come I can't, how come I can't really do anything anymore?

316
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,700
As far as I can tell like, I can't even do the old way that I used to

317
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,500
clear stuff.

318
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,800
All right.

319
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,300
That's the way you want it.

320
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,100
I guess we got to make a new drawing.

321
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,800
New drawing.

322
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,100
And we're back.

323
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,700
Of course.

324
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,200
I can't apparently get the colors that I wanted, either.

325
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
This is just a disaster.

326
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,400
This is, this is the worst thing ever.

327
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,100
I just want I, at this point, I think, I have to write my own drawing

328
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,200
program for this stream, which is absurd like, okay, where'd that

329
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:50,900
layer go?

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,900
Does anyone see it?

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,800
I don't see it.

332
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Where is my Lair?

333
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I think we've got some kind of weirdness going on with the other ones.

334
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,600
We have like a vector layer.

335
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,900
That is.

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Created.

337
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,900
I don't want a vector layer to say the very least.

338
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,300
I want that gone.

339
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,500
Alright, so oh, so that's probably what happened here.

340
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,100
We got some weird vector layer in the mix and then we couldn't clear.

341
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,700
It was clearing that other layer.

342
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,900
Lame, all right.

343
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,300
Well, at least we got something working man.

344
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,400
What an interruption?

345
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,800
So annoying.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay, anyway, back to the topic at hand.

347
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Now that we've got that straightened out with clear this guy.

348
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,800
Okay.

349
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
So what I wanted to talk about before I was so rudely interrupted by

350
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,800
carita, is that if you think about what happens here, right?

351
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,000
If I have any shape at all and I want to do this Mankowski operation,

352
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
so I want to shrink this shape down to a point and I want to expand

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
this shape by it so that I can do ray casting on it as if it were just

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,400
a single point coming against it again.

355
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,700
I sweep the shape around the perimeter of the of this shape and I get

356
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,300
the results.

357
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,300
So, if you imagine putting a circle right and sweeping it around the

358
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,200
perimeter, right?

359
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,600
You can see that basically this plus this, right?

360
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Equals this shape.

361
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
It's a rounded rectangle, right?

362
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,000
There's my new shape, right?

363
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,000
So that's how you do the minkowski sum or how you can conceptualize

364
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,500
the minkowski sum.

365
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,200
Now, that's a very complicated thing to think about because you're

366
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,700
like, well, okay great.

367
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,400
Conceptually.

368
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
That makes sense because I'm a human and I can just imagine sweeping a

369
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,600
shape around another shape.

370
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,400
No big deal.

371
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,700
What does the computer actually do the like, how do I code something?

372
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,500
That works that way, right?

373
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,300
And the answer is well, in one case, it's pretty

374
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,700
All right, in the case where you have two shapes that are essentially

375
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,400
the same shape, right?

376
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,600
Like, two rectangles and you want to, to do the minkowski.

377
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,000
Sum.

378
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,400
All you're talking about is taking the dimensions of the of them and

379
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,599
adding them, right?

380
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,500
If this one was are in, this one, was s like, in the previous example,

381
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,800
then if I want to shrink our down to a point, I just have S Plus r as

382
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,500
my new rectangle, right?

383
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,300
And that's done.

384
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,900
So if there are two shapes that are exactly the same, it's actually

385
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,500
pretty easy.

386
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,300
You just expand the radius and you're done.

387
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:25,000
Right, but there's kind of a hidden assumption there as well, which is

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,900
that, those shapes also have to have, you know, some way to easily

389
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,300
parameterize them like that, but like four rectangles and circles that

390
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,700
would work.

391
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:31,900
Right?

392
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
If we did circles the same would be true.

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
If you got a circle of radius, s in a circle of radius, R and you

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
added them together, you get a circle of radius, S Plus R.

395
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Right?

396
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,400
So that's really easy if you have that, but if you don't have that it

397
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,200
gets a little more complicated.

398
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Like what about this rectangle case here?

399
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,300
I've got a rectangle plus a circle you can see that it makes a much

400
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,400
more complicated shape.

401
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,700
And so if we were going to do say, raycasting against that, we would

402
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,000
have to do very, very specialized raycasting to raycast against

403
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,900
circles and

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Rectangles together to make this sort of composite shape, that

405
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,800
produces the right answer, no matter what you were recasting at.

406
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,500
Right?

407
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,900
And that's actually it's not terribly hard to do even that, but you

408
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,100
could imagine much more difficult ones that were like super crazy.

409
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,500
Like, you know, this is my shape and I'm adding it to like this shape

410
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
or something, right.

411
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,500
And that's going to be this crazy thing with this swept around there,

412
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,000
that's got like another convexity here and whatever, right?

413
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,800
So you can see that it would get pretty complicated.

414
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,700
So there actually is a way that we can do operations like Ray casting

415
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,600
and those sorts of things against very complicated minkowski sums if

416
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
we want to which is called gjk actually.

417
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,100
Which is named after the people who this is One initial from each of

418
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
the people who originally invented the algorithm.

419
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,200
There is this there is a general-purpose algorithm called gjk that

420
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,600
actually allows you to do essentially any minkowski sum operation that

421
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,500
you want to do in that way for things like Ray, casting or Collision

422
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,100
detection with any shape at all as long as it's convex.

423
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,900
So you can't quite do something like this without first breaking it

424
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,000
in.

425
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,300
Two convex pieces, right?

426
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,600
Which would be something like this.

427
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,600
And that's actually pretty common in Collision detection, to take

428
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,000
concat, concavities and break them into convex pieces because

429
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,200
operations on complex pieces are so much faster that you typically is

430
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,600
better to just do for operations or five operations instead of one

431
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,500
operation and do them on convex.

432
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,800
So typically what ends up happening is this will become becomes like

433
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,900
sort of a Workhorse that you use for the Collision detection and you

434
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,000
just end up doing it.

435
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,800
So that you break all your stuff into convicts pieces first.

436
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,000
Now for our game, I don't know that we'll ever actually have all that

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,900
many concave things.

438
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,000
I suspect we'll have mostly convex thing anyway, so this part might

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,400
not be a problem, but we may need to implement this as our final

440
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,500
Collision detection system because we may want to do, some craziness

441
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,300
has like poly polygonal, convex objects, for example.

442
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,000
And circles and all that stuff.

443
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,900
And at that point it becomes pretty difficult.

444
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Usually to conceptualize.

445
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
How you're going to do stuff with a rake a.

446
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,200
So you typically want to do something.

447
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,400
That's gjk or gjk like to do it, but for purposes of just what we need

448
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,700
to do right now, we probably don't have to implicate.

449
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Okay.

450
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,500
Thank you.

451
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,500
Oak Rita.

452
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
At least it's free.

453
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
At least I didn't pay for it.

454
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I guess that's one thing.

455
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,600
I could think of you get what you pay for and it turns out that's not

456
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,200
very much.

457
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,800
Okay, so basically like

458
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,200
What we're doing right now.

459
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,500
If we just want to do rectangles, like I said before, we already know

460
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,200
how to recast against a rectangle, right?

461
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,100
So if we have Point versus rectangle, we actually already know how to

462
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,600
do that.

463
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,200
Right?

464
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
And so if we want to, we can easily make the guy be rectangle as well.

465
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,800
And we can say, you know, okay if we want to make this guy into a

466
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,500
rectangle, no problem.

467
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,700
We'll just take however big the guys radius is and add it to the

468
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,400
radius of the thing.

469
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,300
We're testing against

470
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,700
And we're done, right?

471
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,300
That's it.

472
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,700
So we almost don't have to change our code at all.

473
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,000
Thanks to Mankowski.

474
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,700
Just to do a simple area version.

475
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,000
It's pretty trivial.

476
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,900
Thanks to him.

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,600
Right?

478
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,200
Thanks.

479
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,100
To Makowski and so you can imagine how we would implement this in

480
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,400
code.

481
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
It would actually be really easy.

482
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,400
If we want to give that guy some radius right now, right?

483
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,900
He comes up here and and he can, you know, go through things really

484
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,400
easily and he's unique interpenetrates through.

485
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
And if we wanted to say, let's stop doing that.

486
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,300
Let's give him some more girth there.

487
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,900
What we can do is just in the code.

488
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,100
Why is what is?

489
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,100
I do?

490
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,500
Have another one of these as well?

491
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,400
I have no idea what's going on with creature right now.

492
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm totally lost.

493
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,900
Okay.

494
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,400
If I want to go into the code, which it looks like I didn't ever even

495
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,900
open up my editor yet.

496
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
So, let's open up the editor.

497
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,600
Let's see here.

498
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,400
There we go.

499
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,300
So if we imagine what we would do to our code here where we're testing

500
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,600
all the walls, really we already passed, we already sort of determined

501
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,000
what the shape of the wall was by using Min corner and Max corner.

502
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,800
And what we did is we took the tile side and M and we divided it by 2

503
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,500
to figure out what the span was.

504
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,400
So, all you would have to do is just 2 Min corner and Max Corner

505
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,300
instead of using this as the radius like this is effectively our

506
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,200
radius for Collision, right?

507
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,300
It's the tile map tiles item M.

508
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Instead of just using that everywhere, which is what we were doing

509
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,200
before.

510
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,700
All we have to do is grow that radius.

511
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,800
Now, by however, big, we wanted the player to be and the player

512
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,800
suddenly would have that much area as a rectangle, right?

513
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,500
So, I don't remember what we set the player with and hype to, right.

514
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,600
We have some kind of a thing like that.

515
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,100
I believe that we set earlier, not that it actually meant anything,

516
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,500
but we actually did have

517
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,100
One.

518
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:26,900
Right.

519
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,300
So somewhere in here.

520
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,300
We've got, there we go.

521
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,500
So we've got

522
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
An entity has a width and a height, right?

523
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,300
So when we are doing that Collision detection, when we're doing that,

524
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,900
we have a entity, we have a width and a height for the entity.

525
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,800
So what we could do, when we do that, radius value, because we could

526
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,500
say, okay, we've got a radius.

527
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,300
We've got a with radius and we've got a height radius essentially,

528
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,600
right?

529
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,800
And for the tile map, it's the same in both cases but in the case and

530
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
this is actually, I guess this is more of a diameter.

531
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,300
We're dividing it in half and S.

532
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,800
So this is really the diameter.

533
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,300
Right?

534
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:12,200
So I've got diameter with amateur, with amateur height, amateur height

535
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,000
x 0.

536
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,700
So I can think about just going okay for the with I'm just going to

537
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,800
add that entity within their and for the height.

538
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm going to add that empty height in there and that's the width and

539
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,900
height that we said that the person was right and so I don't actually

540
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,700
remember.

541
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,800
Exactly what we were doing with that.

542
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,300
But it's kind of, I think we were using that more for drawing, but I'm

543
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,100
just gonna use that for Collision detection at the moment.

544
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,300
And so now I believe that rectangle is the size of the Collision area

545
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,300
or should be.

546
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,500
Oh, oh, dear.

547
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
What did I do there?

548
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,400
That didn't work at all.

549
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,600
Okay, I've made a slight error.

550
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,700
I apologize.

551
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,500
My bad don't actually know what I did there.

552
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
So I said that it should work.

553
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Apparently I was, I was quite mistaken.

554
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,400
Hold on a second.

555
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,600
Let me see what I did wrong.

556
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,900
So we have the Tom app.

557
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,100
Cytometer is, we're adding that entity width and height.

558
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,300
Let me step in there and make sure that and and let me see what's

559
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,800
going on here.

560
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,900
So we've got the Min Corner acts in the mid Corner.

561
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,600
Y, which is correct, right?

562
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah.

563
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Let me go ahead and recompile that and make sure and let's step in

564
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,700
there and see what I did wrong there.

565
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,800
I believe that should have just worked but it is fairly early in the

566
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,100
morning.

567
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,800
So I may just be delusional and there's a step that I'm forgetting

568
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,100
here.

569
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
So let's find out.

570
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,100
Okay, so let's there we go.

571
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,400
So when we get into a tile that is supposed to be that we're supposed

572
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,500
to be colliding against

573
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, right.

574
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,700
Never mind.

575
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,700
I know exactly what the problem is here.

576
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,900
So we do have another problem, which is that when we actually look at

577
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,500
all of the tiles and we figure out what the minimum and maximum tile

578
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,300
are that we're going to Loop through.

579
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,800
We do have the issue of looping, through those tiles.

580
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,200
We have to take into account the size of the entity because we may

581
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,400
need to grab more tiles than we would have grabbed that we could be

582
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
colliding against.

583
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Yeah, this is kind of obvious.

584
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
I'm not sure why I didn't mention it before.

585
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
Just wasn't thinking this morning.

586
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,700
So if you imagine what we were doing is we were doing a little

587
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,900
iteration over the over, basically, the entirety of the tiles that

588
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,600
were touched.

589
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,500
We were looking at something where we were saying, okay, you know,

590
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,800
let's say the guy moves from here to here and we said, okay, what are

591
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,300
all the tiles?

592
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,800
We need to check?

593
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,700
Well, we just need to check the tiles into into which that falls,

594
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,000
right, but that's not actually true because if you think about it,

595
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
once the guy has some area here.

596
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,600
She actually could could hit walls that are in tiles, that are further

597
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
away than that.

598
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,800
So, we really need to do is look at

599
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,600
This corner and this corner right of that and say what are all the

600
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,800
tiles that those would overlap and that is actually all the tiles that

601
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,400
we need to check.

602
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,500
So reason we can Tunnel right through stuff.

603
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,900
Now, is we're actually looking at things that we've already passed by

604
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,100
them.

605
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,200
By the time we check them.

606
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,100
We've already gone under the inside of them.

607
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,100
So, yeah, so that's a, that's a fairly obvious thing.

608
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
I don't know why I didn't think of that before we

609
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,000
We hit it.

610
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,300
And so yes, there is another step and that is the step.

611
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,600
So I'm going to go back to doing this the old way, because we didn't

612
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,300
really need.

613
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,200
What I was doing before and I want to also do some kind of a circuit

614
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,600
here.

615
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,600
Let's see.

616
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
So I can I can actually move this loop back to the way that it was as

617
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,100
well.

618
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,700
We can actually do something like this where we do been Thailand Mac

619
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,100
style, right?

620
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,800
Because we said that, we're not going to allow wrapping anymore,

621
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,100
because that was just going to be too much of a pain to maintain

622
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:00,600
least.

623
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,500
I believe it will be.

624
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,600
So we're going to do something like this.

625
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,300
Where we just are back to the good old.

626
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,100
Familiar easy way of doing things.

627
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,900
So we basically have our mint.

628
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll why are maxed out.

629
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:13,900
Why?

630
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,600
And we Loop over them AB style.

631
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,000
X is less than equal to 0 because this is always just easier to think

632
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,200
about.

633
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,000
And so I'm kind of glad that we don't have to deal with the wrapping

634
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
anymore because that was just going to be a huge pain.

635
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,400
Okay.

636
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,400
So there we go, and we need to make sure that we never actually wrap

637
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,800
as well.

638
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,900
So we probably want to do some kind of a, you know,

639
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
A assertion.

640
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,000
You know.

641
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,600
Something like so that we know that when we've wrapped, mint ilex, you

642
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,600
know, something like the fact that these should always be less than,

643
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,700
you know, some reasonable value, right?

644
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,400
We shouldn't we shouldn't ever be getting the gigantic 4 billion ones

645
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,600
here.

646
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,700
So I'm just going to slap one in there.

647
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,100
So, we know because we haven't actually moved our world to the center

648
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,600
yet.

649
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
That's something that we would like to do.

650
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,700
And so just in case we forget and do some stuff off the edge of the

651
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,400
screen there.

652
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,200
I wanted to warn

653
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,500
So we know what happened and we're not like what's going on.

654
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,200
All right, so assuming that I do that I just want to make sure we're

655
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,400
still still good here.

656
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,600
Okay.

657
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,200
There we go.

658
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,800
Assuming I do that.

659
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,900
I would now like to go ahead and account for

660
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,100
basically that that that player sighs this thing right here.

661
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
So what I want to do is I want to make a Min player P.

662
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
That's that's basically

663
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,000
What I really want to do is I want to, I want to extend these by

664
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,700
however big The Entity is in tiles, right?

665
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,200
So after I do, mint ilex Mac style X.

666
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,600
So, on I want to take like the mint ilex, and I want to subtract it by

667
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,800
The Entity tile.

668
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,900
With right?

669
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,200
Basically, I want to do that and I want to do the same for the mint.

670
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,700
I'll why, right?

671
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,600
I want to expand that rectangle out.

672
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Like I drew in the diagram.

673
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,100
So I want to just go ahead and do that.

674
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,000
So what I need to know is I need to know how big the entity is in

675
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
tiles, right?

676
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,300
Rounded up basically.

677
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,300
So what I want to do is say essentially take the ceiling of that.

678
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,400
Let me take a look and see.

679
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,800
I don't actually remember if we ever

680
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,100
Did ceiling.

681
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,400
Did we do ceiling or did?

682
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
We only do floor?

683
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,700
Let's see floor.

684
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,100
So, we did floor, but we never did ceiling.

685
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,300
So, I would like ceiling for this operation, right.

686
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Clf

687
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,300
There we go.

688
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,500
Again, that should be something that we can get to be relatively in

689
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,400
line eventually.

690
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,500
So, what I want to do here is say okay.

691
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:01,100
Well the entity tile with I know his width in actual in like M, right.

692
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,300
I know is within M.

693
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,700
But I want to know what his with would be in Tiles at this point.

694
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,200
Right?

695
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,900
So I want to know and there's two ways I could do this, right?

696
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,900
I could also I could do a slightly more conservative Bound by putting

697
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,100
it actually into the computation here and then rounding out the tiles.

698
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,800
But I'm not going to bother with that.

699
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,900
I'd rather just do a slightly more conservative thing for now and

700
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,400
we'll let that be something to worry about in the final Collision

701
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
detector.

702
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,700
So what I want to do is say well, whatever is with this /, the tile

703
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,600
side and M.

704
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And I guess to be honest, I don't really need now.

705
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,500
I think about it.

706
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,400
I don't really need the ceiling.

707
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,100
So maybe I shouldn't bother putting that in there.

708
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,400
I don't know.

709
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,700
We'll leave it in there just in case.

710
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,400
But what I all I really need to do is say okay if I have the entity

711
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
with and I have the tile sided meters, then I can divide.

712
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
The width.

713
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,400
Sloppy drinker.

714
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,600
I can divide the width by the topside of M, and that will give me how

715
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,400
many tiles he would expand by, right?

716
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,900
And so I can take the ceiling of that and I'm expecting that to

717
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,000
generally be one.

718
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:13,100
But, you know, if you had like a real big entity, you can imagine it

719
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,500
be spanning multiple tiles and then it might be a wider expansion.

720
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,200
So I figured I'd just do it the way that we would you know that we

721
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
would want to do it.

722
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,100
So we're just going to take a look at that and say, okay, let's let's

723
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,600
go ahead and get that out there.

724
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,700
And since this is a this is a

725
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
an actual integer function.

726
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,300
So what we should do now is if we step in here, we should see that box

727
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,100
expand by that mint.

728
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,700
Ilex and mint.

729
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,300
I'll why?

730
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
When we go to do Collision detection.

731
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
So let's take a look at what we computed yet.

732
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,900
One and one which is exactly what I thought it would be.

733
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,900
And then we've got our Min tiles and Max tiles.

734
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
They look like they're coming out correctly.

735
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,100
So now we're going to expand those mint ilex mint.

736
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,100
I'll WiMAX tile xmax tile why?

737
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,100
So we're going to expand those.

738
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,600
Out.

739
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,800
So the mins get smaller the Max's, get bigger, which is

740
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,900
You want.

741
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,800
And now we're doing it over a wider radius, right?

742
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,300
And so, I believe that should solve our problem and it does, of

743
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,900
course, we do have one more thing to to solve, which I'll talk about

744
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,500
in a second.

745
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,200
So, I think we're basically this, this looks like it's actually

746
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,900
working exactly.

747
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,400
Right?

748
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,900
We should also probably stop drawing the walls this way because the

749
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,700
walls are actually bigger.

750
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,200
Because remember I took point nine of them away so we could see around

751
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,500
them.

752
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,400
So it looks it looks roughly, correct.

753
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
All right, so

754
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,900
Very sticky there, which of course is again because we haven't

755
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,400
actually dealt with what happens when you actually hit the wall yet.

756
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,100
So one thing that's happening now though, that you can notice is when

757
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,900
we Collide against this side and when we Collide against the other

758
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,900
side, that's very sticky underwear.

759
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,700
That's so sticky.

760
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:58,900
That's weird.

761
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,400
Right?

762
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,400
Don't you think?

763
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,500
Not that, that is sort of what's interesting about that.

764
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,300
I wonder if we have another bug, but that is this is what I was

765
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,300
expecting to have happen to our Collision Vector before and I wonder

766
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,100
if it's just because all of our stuff was tile, the line that we

767
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,300
weren't having that happen.

768
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:21,900
It's just kind of like this is the stickiness was what I was expecting

769
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,699
to happen with the old Collision detection and that I was going to

770
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,100
talk about how we would have to get rid of it and so on.

771
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,900
But anyway, so I feel like something bizarre is happening there too,

772
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,699
though, because I believe we're still using an Epsilon when we set

773
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,500
things away.

774
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,699
So I think we've just got a straight-up Thug in there as well.

775
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,199
Because if you remember we're actually placing the guy a little bit

776
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,500
away from the wall.

777
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,699
So when he tries to go the other direction, he should not actually

778
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,000
still be hitting it.

779
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,400
So I do think that he shouldn't actually be getting stuck in that

780
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,000
fashion.

781
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,600
Even at this early stage with the clinic.

782
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,400
So I think we have another bug in there that I'm not thinking of, but

783
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm not sure exactly what it is.

784
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,400
So we'll have to think about that in a second.

785
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,700
So anyway, point being

786
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,500
What I was going to talk about first is the fact that you'll notice

787
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,700
we're drawing his height off of this.

788
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,400
This, this pixel here.

789
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,100
We're drawing his height offset from where he actually is, right.

790
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,900
So his center point, where we're drawing.

791
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,100
This rectangle, were drawing him as if the whole height comes off of

792
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,800
that bottom point, right?

793
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,400
And so what happens is when I hit the bottom Edge, I stopped where I

794
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,500
would have stopped if the rectangle was was done this way.

795
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,600
And of course, that's exactly what we would expect to happen because

796
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,400
the Collision detector is treating it as if it's a radius value out

797
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
from that center point.

798
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,100
So what we actually want to do is talk about just this area or

799
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,000
whatever the area is that his coach is going to be in.

800
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,600
We want that to sort of be the center of where he collides against,

801
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,100
right?

802
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,800
And we want, we don't want to start to think about it in the other

803
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:53,900
way.

804
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,300
So the entity width and height,

805
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,200
White is actually going to be about that around with wherever the

806
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,800
center is of.

807
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Vision.

808
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,900
And what we want, the bounce would be around there.

809
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,600
So I want to start drawing him that way because that's that's the way

810
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,800
it's actually going to work.

811
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
If I go take a look at where we're doing that drawing for the

812
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
entities, you can kind of see what I mean by that.

813
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,500
We basically have a thing where we do the player left top and you can

814
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,100
see that we subtract the whole height.

815
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,000
So what we actually want to do is subtract half the height.

816
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,600
So now it's centered just like the old one and you can kind of see

817
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,200
that that that is more the rectangle that we're talking about and that

818
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,000
one stops the way that you would expect it to stop and so on and and

819
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,600
so now we're actually correct but that is not the the size.

820
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,100
Probably want to use for that entity with.

821
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
So what we probably want to do is make his entity.

822
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm sorry entity height.

823
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,000
So we probably want to do is make as entity height a little bit a

824
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,600
little bit better.

825
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
So I believe that's an initialize player.

826
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,400
And so this is not really the height.

827
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
It's really his Collision height and I don't know if we want to talk

828
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
about his actual height as well.

829
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,800
So we may want to actually talk about dimensions in a slightly

830
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,500
different way.

831
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,100
So I'm not sure how we want to talk about this eventually.

832
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,700
So for right now, we'll say that that it's just going to be something

833
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,900
like, you know, .5 + + 1 .5.

834
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,100
I don't know.

835
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
How big is that?

836
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,900
Let's find out.

837
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,300
It's a little bit.

838
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
That's not what I meant to do.

839
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,600
That's what I meant.

840
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,000
There.

841
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,600
Are you?

842
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,300
Yeah, so that's a little too small.

843
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
Let's make it still a little bit wider.

844
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,600
So maybe his width is about one and its height is about 0.5 because of

845
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,400
just the way, the games perspective is, that's probably a little bit

846
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,200
more, like, what you would expect, the shadow of the player to be.

847
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,600
And so off, he goes through here and so on and he can hit things like

848
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
we'd expect.

849
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,300
Okay.

850
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
So what I'd like to do now is before we go ahead and do the gliding

851
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,800
our area code.

852
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,200
Is working properly, but before I go ahead and do the gliding, I want

853
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,600
to figure out why we're getting that sticking problem, which is bogus.

854
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,300
Okay.

855
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,100
There we go.

856
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,700
Yep.

857
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,400
So we've got our area collection back, and as you can see, with

858
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,500
Makowski makowsky makes a lot of things much easier than they would.

859
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,300
Otherwise be because you can basically use the same code that you

860
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,700
would have used for something else and you just fiddle with the inputs

861
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,400
a little and all of a sudden you get something great, right?

862
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
That's what you wanted.

863
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
So you can also see the and this is why I say that.

864
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,100
Eventually want to do circles.

865
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,900
You can see how with the rectangle, I kind of would stop here and

866
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,200
there would be really no gliding.

867
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,600
I could do whereas with a circle it would kind of roll me off into

868
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
inside.

869
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,900
Once we actually implement the gliding code which we haven't done yet.

870
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,100
Right, but you can see that that won't actually improve.

871
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,200
So yeah.

872
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,500
So what I want to do is I want to take a look at the sticking now.

873
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,900
So what I want to do is know what's happening here, why I can't get

874
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Out of here.

875
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,500
I want to see, I want to actually just look.

876
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,800
At the code directly and find out why we're getting sticking.

877
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Because I feel like with the Epsilon, we shouldn't have mailed do

878
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,200
that.

879
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,500
That's obviously not true.

880
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,400
And so yeah, so I'm going to go ahead and set our our Loop Point here.

881
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,800
So we do a loop Point set.

882
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm going to move out for a while so that I know that I'm trying to

883
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,600
push outwards and then little bit

884
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,300
All right, so I'm going to go in here and say, let's go ahead and step

885
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,400
in and and see what's going on.

886
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,200
So we're here.

887
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,400
Let's go ahead and step in here.

888
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,900
So we're basically only checking two tiles.

889
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,800
We're checking the tile that were on and we're checking the tile below

890
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,100
us.

891
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,100
Basically is what's happening there.

892
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,900
Right?

893
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,800
If you look at them in tile X and them into Mac style, the maxxtow

894
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,600
WiMAX Alex.

895
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,800
Let's take a look at the DDP.

896
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,300
Make sure it's something that we want.

897
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,800
So that's not actually a DDP that I want.

898
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,000
I wanted to DDP that was going to be actually trying to move us down,

899
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,000
right?

900
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
Why is my DDP?

901
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Oh, he's so tiny.

902
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Obviously, the Collision detector, can't move us anywhere.

903
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,400
At the DDP is always super tiny.

904
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,200
Hmm.

905
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,600
Hmm.

906
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,600
What what is the meaning of that people?

907
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,900
What is the meaning of it?

908
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
Why is that happening?

909
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I don't understand.

910
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,900
I was, I recorded a thing where he was definitely moving down.

911
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,300
We should be able to get a DDP where he's actually moving himself

912
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,800
down, but it doesn't seem like that's ever happening.

913
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Let's go out and see why not.

914
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:48,900
Okay.

915
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,800
Game update.

916
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,600
Let's see.

917
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,100
So, no one.

918
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,400
What?

919
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,500
What is the problem here?

920
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,100
I do not understand what's going on.

921
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,400
There we go.

922
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,000
Okay, so I guess it just stopped in the middle of in the middle of one

923
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,700
randomly.

924
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,300
Alright, so the controller is not analog ended down.

925
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:21,700
So GD.

926
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:28,600
P-- dot Y is negative 1 GD p-- dot X is 1 move in here.

927
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,200
See what we've got GDP is 1 negative 1 so we have to renormalize we

928
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,300
get the right thing.

929
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,500
Multiplied about the player speed which is good.

930
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,000
What?

931
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,300
His velocity.

932
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,500
Was - that.

933
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,600
Did you see what I saw there?

934
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
How did his velocity be equal?

935
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,600
- what it was?

936
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,900
What is going on here?

937
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,500
We're not even updating the velocity, right?

938
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Oh, is it just are we just seeing literally, that fact that the

939
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,600
velocity is never getting updated because we haven't actually gone in

940
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,700
and done.

941
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,900
And actually done any work to correct it.

942
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,300
That seems odd though.

943
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
Why would that be the case?

944
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,100
I guess.

945
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,700
I could imagine that being the case.

946
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,000
Let's just see if that's true.

947
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,400
I'm going to go ahead and test that just to make sense because that's

948
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
pretty interesting, I guess.

949
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,700
So, I guess if we just go on and implemented gliding we would have

950
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
gotten rid of the problem.

951
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,200
But yeah, so in this case when we did the team in there when we when

952
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
we sort of loop through here and found it.

953
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,400
Basically we're saying is if team in is less than 1.

954
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,100
No.

955
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,100
Then we would want to go ahead and zero that velocity out and that

956
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
would just stop him entirely in his tracks.

957
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,700
Right?

958
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,600
Is that really the problem?

959
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,300
That seems odd, but I guess it could be.

960
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,400
Let's find out.

961
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,500
It does look like that was indeed the problem.

962
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
Well, totally fine.

963
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,600
That's fair.

964
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:26,400
All right.

965
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,700
So I guess that means, we really didn't need to debug that because if

966
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,100
we just gone ahead and finish the gliding implementation where we were

967
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,300
going to update the velocity for our new Collision detector, it would

968
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,000
have just worked.

969
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,600
But hey, it was good to inspect any way so that we know what it was

970
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,100
and aren't, you know, worried about it, I guess.

971
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,900
So, that's fine.

972
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,400
So, we're now in good shape.

973
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
We've got the area working fine.

974
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,800
So, all we want to do now is implement the gliding and to implement

975
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,300
the gliding.

976
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,000
We just have to do the same thing that we did before, right?

977
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Where we update.

978
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,800
Basically, using that same idea here where we did, we did our sort of

979
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,900
our balanced equation, right?

980
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,500
Where we actually take away all of the bounce velocity and just leave

981
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,600
the remaining velocity.

982
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,500
Right?

983
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,300
So if we want to do that, we still have the exact the exact same code

984
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,200
essentially, but I'm going to make it a little bit cleaner.

985
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,400
So basically, if we go down here, I'm going to say that, you know,

986
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,600
after we do this F, redo this test.

987
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,300
Well bit, I'm going to go ahead and say

988
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,700
We got to update our velocity instead of doing it this way.

989
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to do this inner product

990
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,400
thing.

991
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,100
You notice that the way that this is set up.

992
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,300
It's saying that the existing velocity, we subtracted away.

993
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,600
The part that we didn't want any more of that velocity, right?

994
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,900
And by doing the way that we did that is we used an inner product with

995
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
essentially the normal.

996
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,600
If you remember the normal to the wall that we hit and what's nice

997
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,500
about this equation, is this actually works whether or not you hit a

998
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,300
wall because if we just set the normal of the

999
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,800
Wall to be 0 0.

1000
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,500
This would, this term would evaluate to 0.

1001
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,700
Right.

1002
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So what we could do is just say we always update the velocity with

1003
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,700
whatever wall he hit and when we just have a wall.

1004
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,100
Oops.

1005
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,300
Wall normal right here that we're going to track.

1006
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,100
So we have wool normal and it's going to be equal to 0 0.

1007
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,600
Always

1008
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,300
Right, and then we're just going to update that along with our team

1009
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,500
in.

1010
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,400
Actually, trying to think of how I want to do this.

1011
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,300
I don't think this thing really knows what the wall normal is.

1012
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,400
So let's do it this way for now.

1013
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,100
Right.

1014
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,300
Well normal.

1015
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,100
Equals whatever the normal would be.

1016
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,400
And so we're basically just doing the exact same code that we did

1017
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:52,900
before.

1018
00:45:53,800 --> 00:46:00,000
Only this time I'm setting an arbitrary will normal so we could expand

1019
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,300
this code I guess to use walls that were not like nothing in the code.

1020
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,500
Now really counts on the fact that the walls are horizontal vertical.

1021
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,000
Accept our are sort of not particularly good solution up here to

1022
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,900
testing the wall.

1023
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900
It's this this code right here would have to get a little bit better

1024
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,600
to handle a slanted wall, but that's about it.

1025
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,400
So,

1026
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,300
I want to do is say alright, we can return whether we hit or not.

1027
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,600
So hit equals false.

1028
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,500
And in this case, hit equals true, right?

1029
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:37,200
So will return true print hit and now I'll just go ahead and set the

1030
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,700
normal to what.

1031
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,000
I know.

1032
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,600
Each of these will normals to be and off we go.

1033
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,700
So in this case,

1034
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,700
I'm testing us them in corner X so that normal would be in that

1035
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,200
direction for the max Corner.

1036
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,800
Exit would be in the opposite direction X.

1037
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,800
Same thing here and here, right?

1038
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,200
And so, I believe that should update our velocity correctly.

1039
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,600
Now, excuse me, so we should be able to Glide.

1040
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,100
If I didn't mess it up, which I may have and it looks like I did.

1041
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,900
Did I forget to what did I forget to do here?

1042
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,900
So well normal.

1043
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,000
I feel like,

1044
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
Why is he stopping there?

1045
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,200
What did I want to die?

1046
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Mistakenly?

1047
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,700
Do.

1048
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,000
There's one thing we need to do in addition to this, but I feel like I

1049
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
should have glided properly just from that.

1050
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,400
Yeah, let me let me verify that it's not the other thing that we need

1051
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,900
to do first, and I'm pretty sure it's not.

1052
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,400
Okay, so it actually is alright.

1053
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,900
Never mind.

1054
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:49,900
Hmm.

1055
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,700
I take it back.

1056
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,600
Okay, so now we're at the situation.

1057
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,300
He actually is blinding properly.

1058
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,800
I take it back.

1059
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,900
You can actually see him gliding properly there, the problem.

1060
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,400
We have to do the final thing that I said, if you remember when we

1061
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
talked about.

1062
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,000
I thought he was coming to a complete stop.

1063
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,600
He actually isn't, he's only stopping if we continue to try and go to

1064
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,100
the wall.

1065
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,000
So we're at the point where we can finally fix the final problem that

1066
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,200
we had, which is what we were talking about before where it's, it

1067
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,700
doesn't continue the move after it does this.

1068
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,400
And so remember I said, we have to do a loop where we try to correct

1069
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,200
the velocity during collision and keep trying to move him for the

1070
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,300
remainder of the time, step.

1071
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,900
Right?

1072
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,900
So that's what we want to do now.

1073
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,800
So, basically, what we need to do is say okay, we've got.

1074
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,500
We now have to go ahead and

1075
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,300
And do this sort of test where we're going over things.

1076
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,100
This part here, right?

1077
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,500
We have to do this for some number of iterations so that we can say,

1078
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,600
we've got our mics, don't need to call it Innovation.

1079
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,900
Index is just iteration.

1080
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,600
I think I said for would be how many we do?

1081
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,700
Because we don't want, we want a bounded number.

1082
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,000
We don't want to just keep going until it's zero.

1083
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,400
So basically, what we would start out with is we'd have a tea

1084
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
remaining essentially, right?

1085
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That starts off at one point O, which is to try and do the whole move,

1086
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:10,600
right?

1087
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,900
And what we want to do now is say, okay.

1088
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,700
We have this, we have the that player Delta.

1089
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,700
Which is the value that we computed, that's how far we want to go.

1090
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,400
Right?

1091
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,800
So we have that player, Delta and the player Delta.

1092
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,400
We're going to start off by saying we have all of the player Delta to

1093
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,200
try and account for.

1094
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,200
We want to try and move him the entire player Delta distance, right?

1095
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,500
And then when we do the code for hitting the wall, we say, OK, we

1096
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,900
start the team in meaning the minimum distance that we could go along

1097
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,900
it is and I guess in this case, we could say, it's

1098
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:50,700
.0.

1099
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,300
Right.

1100
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:58,400
Excuse me is how far we want to go and then when we finish we know how

1101
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,100
much of the T how much of the step we've actually used right?

1102
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,400
We know we know trying to get how to say this.

1103
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,500
We know once we take one of these steps.

1104
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:15,300
We know how far in t we've gone because at the end we have a new team

1105
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,100
in, right?

1106
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,100
We've updated team in to be the percentage of clay or Delta that we've

1107
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,700
used.

1108
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,800
Does that make sense?

1109
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,600
So essentially RT remaining, right?

1110
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,000
We subtract away whatever the inverse of that team in is because

1111
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,400
essentially we've sort of said and you know, I guess we could do it.

1112
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
We could do the math.

1113
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,300
I'm trying to think of this is a good idea or not.

1114
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,900
We could actually do the math such that we actually are always just

1115
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,800
using team in if we want to maybe.

1116
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
I'll try to do it that way.

1117
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,800
So we start with our team and at one point O, which is we can move the

1118
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,700
full distance along the player, Delta, right?

1119
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,600
And then we go in here.

1120
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,100
We update team in to be how far we actually have moved until we hit

1121
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,800
the wall and then we try again.

1122
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,300
To move, you know with with the new team in and we keep producing it

1123
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:10,800
and if team in ever Falls to zero, so basically like and teaming is

1124
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,800
greater than 0.

1125
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,500
If T Min ever Falls 20.

1126
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,800
We've done the entire movement.

1127
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,100
We're done, right?

1128
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,200
So that's totally fine.

1129
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,900
So basically what we want to do is say if we didn't hit anything,

1130
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,900
right?

1131
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,400
Because this that each time we update this, our team in will go down

1132
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,200
to the to the distance that it went.

1133
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,800
Now I you know what, just thinking about this the sense of it's just

1134
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,000
wrong.

1135
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,600
I just don't think I can do that.

1136
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,400
Yeah, I can't sorry in my head.

1137
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,000
I just can't figure out a way to make that work.

1138
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Will see after I write it the with the two variables will see if

1139
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,800
there's a way to do it entirely and team in.

1140
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I don't know if there's are not.

1141
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,600
So I'm just going to say that we have some time.

1142
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,700
Step remaining we have the team in and we basically say how much of

1143
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,000
the team in do we use.

1144
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,500
And then at the end we take T remaining and we subtract from it.

1145
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,100
Whatever was left of the team in, right?

1146
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,900
So basically if we didn't, if we got to go the entirety, if team in

1147
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,300
was the entire way, so it was 1.0.

1148
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,300
Right?

1149
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,100
We would subtract from it.

1150
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,500
Hmm.

1151
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,500
Sorry, know if team in was the 1.0., We'd subtract the entire thing.

1152
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,600
Yeah, so we always subtract how far in team and we actually went.

1153
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,500
Yeah, that's right.

1154
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,700
So, okay.

1155
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
So what we have to do here is say alright.

1156
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,000
Here's our player, Delta.

1157
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,600
Right.

1158
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,200
And Artie is how far along this we've gone, right?

1159
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,700
So when we do our team in what our team in tells us is where we

1160
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,400
stopped along this line.

1161
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,800
It tells us the percentage right from 0 to 100%, right?

1162
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,900
So it ranges from 0 to 1 where we stopped.

1163
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,000
If we went all the way to 1, right?

1164
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,800
If you're always 100% we're done.

1165
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,900
So we always take whatever our team in comes out and we subtract from

1166
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,100
how much we had of tea to begin with, right?

1167
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:02,800
So,

1168
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,600
This case.

1169
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,100
Right.

1170
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,900
Our team in is when we first start out our team and could be 1.0 and

1171
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:12,900
we could go the entire way and we're going to stop on the team

1172
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,900
remaining, gets to zero.

1173
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,500
But on subsequent times through the loop, we could just say we have

1174
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,200
how only however much T.

1175
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
We actually had left to use, right?

1176
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,000
And then we go from there.

1177
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,300
I believe that would work just fine.

1178
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,900
And then what we want to do is say, well, when we do our updating,

1179
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,100
right, we need to do the updating every time, right?

1180
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,600
Because every time we hit a wall, we need to update the player

1181
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,200
location to that point, right?

1182
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,500
And then we need to update doing.

1183
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,200
And then we need to update the the velocity to get rid of whatever

1184
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,200
Parts part of the wall normal, but we have to do the same thing, right

1185
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,800
for our player do.

1186
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,700
So our player Delta has to be chopped so that it's not trying to go

1187
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,000
into the wall anymore either.

1188
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,500
So, basically the exact same equation, where we do that bounce, we

1189
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,100
have to do that for the player, Delta as well.

1190
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:12,500
Right?

1191
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,200
So we get rid of whatever portion it was trying to go into the wall.

1192
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,000
Now remember this offset is somewhat expensive.

1193
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,500
So really, we could decide just not to do that offset the player

1194
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,300
positions thing, right?

1195
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,800
We could decide to do the player position thing.

1196
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,300
Outside here and have a thing called total player Delta, which

1197
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:36,400
basically says, what part of the player Delta actually got used and

1198
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,100
will Summit.

1199
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,800
So we'll save total player, Delta right?

1200
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,000
Is going to add whatever.

1201
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,200
The step was that actually was used.

1202
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,100
Right?

1203
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,700
And then what we need to do is we need to update that player position.

1204
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,900
So this this thing where we do the real old player, oh, well, I guess,

1205
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,700
never mind.

1206
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,600
So I guess since that is something that we're actually still using.

1207
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The loop we might as well keep it this way first since we're still

1208
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,800
using the entity The Entity p.

1209
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,500
And so old player P.

1210
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,400
I believe old player P is never.

1211
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,400
I don't even actually know why we still have old player P.

1212
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,700
We're just we're just talking about entity P, really this entire time

1213
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,800
and that's easier to update.

1214
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,900
So I'm going to go ahead and say that we do it this way and I might

1215
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,100
get rid of old player piece, as full player P is not actually used

1216
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,000
anywhere as far as I know.

1217
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,100
Okay, so to use there, so we just want to snap it once the beginning.

1218
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,700
So that's fine.

1219
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,200
I'll leave it around.

1220
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,300
All right, so I got to update the end of this position with his new

1221
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:34,800
position.

1222
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,700
I gotta update the velocity with the new velocity and then I got

1223
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,500
update how what we're trying to where we're trying to go to with the

1224
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,500
new amount that we're trying to go to as well.

1225
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,100
So let me take a look at that.

1226
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,900
We don't want Total player Delta.

1227
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,000
That's just regular player Delta.

1228
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,300
Now we go and so, let's see how that does.

1229
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,300
There we go.

1230
00:55:57,300 --> 00:56:00,200
So there's our skating Loop still getting a problem.

1231
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,600
There.

1232
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,900
That doesn't look quite right.

1233
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,600
So we still got a bug but we're almost there.

1234
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,900
Just not quite just knock, just not quite there.

1235
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:09,900
All right.

1236
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,200
So what's our problem?

1237
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:11,500
Here?

1238
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,000
We did our offset properly.

1239
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,600
Oops.

1240
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,500
My laptop screen has gone to sleep.

1241
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,500
That's not going to be very good for reading a Q&A.

1242
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,300
Certainly.

1243
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Let's try that again.

1244
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,400
There we go.

1245
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:27,800
and,

1246
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,400
Okay.

1247
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,200
So what we need to do now is figure out what I did wrong.

1248
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:34,600
There.

1249
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,400
We are updating.

1250
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,300
What are we updating here?

1251
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,300
So let's make sure I've got everything correct.

1252
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,900
So we've got our absolute tile Z.

1253
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,500
We've got that we've got the center tile.

1254
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,600
Point is being computed properly.

1255
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,200
Yes, we get the tile value.

1256
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,600
This is the entity with that height.

1257
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,100
That's based on that.

1258
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,300
That's all correct.

1259
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,800
We're subtracting into PP, which is the thing that we are updating.

1260
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,700
So, that's good.

1261
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,500
And then we do all of our testing, we get our well, numbers back.

1262
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
We update the end of Deep.

1263
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,300
You buy, whatever the player Delta was that we computed.

1264
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,500
We remove the part of the player, Delta that would have gone against

1265
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,400
the wall, normal, which I believe is what we wanted to do, and we

1266
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,900
update the velocity of the guy as well based on that.

1267
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,700
Well normal.

1268
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,100
And then we take away whatever the amount is that we stepped forward,

1269
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,300
which seems

1270
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,100
I think okay.

1271
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:35,300
So I may be I may be double counting that.

1272
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,600
Let me think about that.

1273
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:41,400
So I think I'm double-counting that because if I were although that

1274
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,500
shouldn't have really been in effect.

1275
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,900
The second velocity should have worked either way.

1276
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,300
But yeah, so you would still go the whole player Delta because we are

1277
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,400
accounting for the fact the player Delta is getting smaller.

1278
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,100
So I think actually

1279
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Technically, this should always be 1.0 and then when we subtract it

1280
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,700
out, it's just, we subtract whatever portion of the player remaining,

1281
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,600
we used.

1282
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,500
If that makes sense.

1283
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,800
I believe that's correct.

1284
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,200
Yeah.

1285
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,500
So I think that was our only bug.

1286
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,400
Not sure if you saw what happened there.

1287
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,300
So, I'm not sure where it's still entirely, correct.

1288
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,700
I'm a little bit nervous.

1289
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,600
There's a weird thing that's happening there.

1290
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,700
Which is I believe because our epsilon's too high, like, you can sort

1291
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,200
of see, I don't know if you can see it.

1292
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,100
Kind of when you go, he moves a little closer.

1293
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,000
You know, what I could do.

1294
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,300
I could we had a key.

1295
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,300
That's what it was.

1296
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,600
It make it bigger.

1297
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,300
So you can kind of see he squishes into the wall a little bit and I

1298
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,100
believe what's happening.

1299
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,800
There is our Epsilon actually stops him before he would actually get

1300
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,700
to where the wall is and so as he moves in a slighter fashion, he can

1301
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,100
actually get a little closer to the wall.

1302
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,900
So I think, what we want to do is we want to make our Epsilon tighter

1303
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,900
than it was so.

1304
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,100
I'm going to say.

1305
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,800
So the Epsilon the problem is the Epsilon is only in player Delta

1306
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
space which is not great.

1307
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,700
I don't think that's particularly good and I feel like we should

1308
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,000
probably get rid of this Epsilon eventually.

1309
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,300
Anyway, in the real question is Hector.

1310
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,200
I think what we'll do is just not have it but that's a separate issue.

1311
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,700
So let's take a look and see if that's a little bit better.

1312
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,000
Of course, that's too close.

1313
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,800
You can see, you can see why you don't want to have these epsilon's,

1314
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,300
right?

1315
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,500
So we want to do something that doesn't actually have to have the

1316
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:48,900
Epsilon.

1317
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,800
This may be good enough just for now because like I said, we want to

1318
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,300
do the regular Collision detection.

1319
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,400
We want to do it a little differently.

1320
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,900
Anyway when we're actually doing so it's probably better to deal with

1321
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,900
those things there but there is that little

1322
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,900
Weirdness that I don't love.

1323
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,500
It's kind of hard.

1324
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,500
You can see it, right?

1325
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,700
You can kind of see it.

1326
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,500
Yeah, we also have that problem of like the players velocity, as it

1327
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,200
gets clipped.

1328
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:20,000
It's causing his facing direction to be like changing very rapidly in

1329
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,700
the when he actually hits things.

1330
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,000
So we probably have to pick his facing Direction on something, a

1331
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,100
little more stable as well.

1332
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:31,800
But yeah, you can see kind of see how it how he scoots into the wall a

1333
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,500
little bit.

1334
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,000
So that's that's just lame right there.

1335
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,000
And so I think now that I think about it, the fact that this Epsilon

1336
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,100
is in that the wrong Space is really most of the problem there.

1337
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,800
So thinking about what would have to happen for that essentially.

1338
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,200
So when we actually do that team in you'd have to actually say you

1339
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,500
know, how big is the player Delta and you'd have to adjust based on

1340
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,100
that?

1341
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:08,100
So I'm not sure I'm not sure exactly what the what the best way to do

1342
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,200
that.

1343
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,600
Would be because if the player Delta is really small, then you would

1344
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,100
want to do is a really small Delta.

1345
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,200
So you want to actually make that that minimum a little bit different.

1346
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,600
So what I could do is say that the epsilon's not going to happen here,

1347
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,800
you know, the Epsilon is going to be happening outside and that would

1348
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,500
be better but still not fantastic, right?

1349
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,700
So essentially, you know, in the case where where we actually did hit

1350
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,300
something.

1351
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,600
So I say equals false in the case, where you actually did hit

1352
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,000
something.

1353
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,400
I could apply that Epsilon outside, which is again, not not

1354
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,900
particularly great, having an Epsilon at all.

1355
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,000
It's not good in general, but I could say if hit and if in the case

1356
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,800
that we hit, we also know that we only need to do these when we hit.

1357
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,300
So, you know, we could do something like like that so that we break

1358
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:04,900
out immediately and don't have to do the test.

1359
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,400
I don't know if that's, that's probably not really worth.

1360
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:12,000
But we do know, for example, that we don't need to update any of these

1361
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,700
unless we actually hit.

1362
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,200
So so, okay.

1363
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:24,300
So in that case if we actually did the hit then we would do it, but I

1364
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,600
can't quite do it that way, I guess.

1365
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:25,900
So.

1366
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Alright, never mind.

1367
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,100
Never mind.

1368
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,000
Thought we were going to be clever, but we weren't so in the case

1369
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,500
where we hit, I'll just say this equals that Epsilon there at the end.

1370
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:43,600
And the only reason I'm thinking that that's the case is because now I

1371
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,900
can actually see whatever RT remaining was Artie remaining.

1372
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,600
We could actually use to boost that Epsilon up to larger values based

1373
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,300
on how far we were thought we were moving because I believe that most

1374
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,400
of it is

1375
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:05,000
Well, I'm not actually sure if now you know, what why did I do that?

1376
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,900
That doesn't really make any sense because there really isn't that

1377
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,900
much information that I could use outside.

1378
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,700
It's still the same as the information that we have in here, right?

1379
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,400
I could just do whatever I was going to do.

1380
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,200
I could do in here.

1381
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,000
So I'm going to leave that that way for now.

1382
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,500
Because I don't see a super easy way to fix that without doing

1383
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:27,500
something better because again that Epsilon is just going to be.

1384
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,600
The problem is when you when you actually do hit the wall.

1385
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,200
You've got that Epsilon.

1386
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,000
That wants to be a little bit different.

1387
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,300
Yeah.

1388
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,200
See, that's just bad behavior right there.

1389
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,300
You can kind of see I don't know if you can see that.

1390
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,200
That will on the stream.

1391
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,000
I believe alt one or there.

1392
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,700
I believe there was some way we had that.

1393
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,900
We're supposed to zoom in.

1394
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,700
Well, zoom in is running control one.

1395
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,300
Maybe there we go.

1396
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,100
Ooh, I guess that doesn't work, unfortunately.

1397
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Can I zoom in there?

1398
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,100
So unfortunately while I'm zoomed in I can't animate.

1399
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,300
So I guess I so that Zoom effect doesn't really work for this but you

1400
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:10,900
can kind of see what's happening as I as I go in there and I don't

1401
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,100
know.

1402
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,100
That might just be another bug.

1403
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,600
We could look at in a little more detail.

1404
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,700
But basically I want him to stop directly on the wall and not have

1405
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,000
that little stuttering behavior.

1406
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,600
And I guess I'm not entirely certain that that's the Epsilon.

1407
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,700
So I guess what I could do to you know what, I'm going to go into the

1408
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,200
In a little bit just because I feel like I can I want to I want to

1409
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,900
just look and see if there's another bug in there.

1410
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:38,600
It's want to watch what the behavior is that happens when he hits that

1411
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,000
wall.

1412
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,000
So I can do that actually pretty easily because I know that he's going

1413
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,200
to hit this wall, right?

1414
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,700
That's the well, he's kidding.

1415
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,900
So if I want to, I can stop just when he's about to hit that wall,

1416
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,500
right?

1417
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,500
Which is right here.

1418
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,900
So, let's take a look at what actually happens when you hit that wall.

1419
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,600
None of these other wall should hit presumably because he's just

1420
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,600
hitting that one wall.

1421
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:09,900
Yep.

1422
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:16,700
And so let's see what's our team in our team in is 0.75 and

1423
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,700
What's a player, Delta?

1424
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,400
Our player, Delta is negative 0.2.

1425
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,200
So he's trying to move that much and he's basically not moving in Y at

1426
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:29,400
all.

1427
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,700
Right, Sandy - 06.

1428
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,400
That's a very tiny value in y.

1429
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,900
All right.

1430
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,700
So when I update my entity P, I'm going to move him by the amount that

1431
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,500
he was able to move.

1432
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,600
Right?

1433
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,000
Which is 75 percent roughly of the way to the wall.

1434
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:50,800
And so,

1435
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,900
We go ahead and do that.

1436
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,100
Now.

1437
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,600
Where does that leave him?

1438
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,600
The player position?

1439
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,400
Let's see.

1440
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,200
Entity pee.

1441
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,200
Where does that leave him?

1442
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,600
Oops, versus where the wall is?

1443
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,700
I'm going to delete some of this stuff so I can start fresh.

1444
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,500
Where does that leave him?

1445
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:15,300
So we have tile map tile side in meters, right?

1446
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,500
That is oops.

1447
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,200
What about two?

1448
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,700
That is about point seven.

1449
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,300
And so we're going to do our offset of the player now, so we do that

1450
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:36,100
offset and we get an ex of - 0.19, which is actually nowhere close to

1451
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,400
this, which is fine because we also have the player with to account

1452
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,700
for.

1453
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:44,200
So what's the entity with

1454
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,500
The Entity with is one that's point five, so that's that's stopping

1455
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,800
him right on the.

1456
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,800
That's, that's doing exactly, right.

1457
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,100
It's basically what's happening.

1458
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,200
So I think we just have another bug here.

1459
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,300
Okay.

1460
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,700
So entity DP.

1461
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:06,400
We're updating the velocity of the fellow himself, we have clipped his

1462
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,300
x velocity away, which is exactly what we want.

1463
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,900
We are taking the player Delta which is this right here, which is how

1464
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,200
he's trying to move that is clipped as well.

1465
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:21,800
And we are taking the T remaining which was all of it and we're

1466
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,000
reducing it to just what was left after the move.

1467
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,700
Right?

1468
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,100
And so I think that's that's what we were expecting.

1469
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,300
So, that's fine.

1470
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,400
Let's see what happens now.

1471
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:39,000
So now we got a team in of 1.0 again, and we're going to see whether

1472
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,600
or not we collide with anything.

1473
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:40,800
Now.

1474
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,500
My understanding is we should not collide with anything right?

1475
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,300
Because we are free and clear at the moment.

1476
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:51,000
So I feel like if I were to set these, we should not hit one of them

1477
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,200
and we don't, so that's good.

1478
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,100
That's behaving as we would expect it to.

1479
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,700
So now we have to do our offset again.

1480
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,400
We have the player Delta, the player Delta has no X component

1481
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,100
whatsoever.

1482
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,300
And the DP, let's see here.

1483
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Entity DP also has none so they should really not change much at all

1484
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,200
except in y, right?

1485
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,500
And that's fine.

1486
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:19,500
So, there we go.

1487
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,100
And

1488
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,399
Player Delta.

1489
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,800
Does not get updated team in was 1.0.

1490
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:30,600
So now two remaining is 0 and we should fall out of the loop.

1491
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,600
Yeah, so we did exactly what we thought we should do.

1492
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:40,899
So now the question I guess is just the second time through I guess it

1493
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:41,399
was wrong.

1494
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:47,399
Must be because that is apparently correct, that all looked exactly

1495
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,100
right to me.

1496
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,000
Nothing.

1497
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,200
Nothing bad happened there.

1498
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,600
Right.

1499
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,200
So, what is happening with that nonsense?

1500
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:58,700
So, in order to fix that again, I'm going to lean on our Loop Live

1501
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,200
code editing.

1502
01:08:59,200 --> 01:08:59,899
As I so often.

1503
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:05,000
I'm going to set that up and then do this, right?

1504
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,600
So now he's just constantly creating into the wall and that will make

1505
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,200
sure that he that I can basically to bug the exact case that's

1506
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:11,700
happening.

1507
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:12,500
Right?

1508
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,399
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set that break point again.

1509
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,600
I'm going to set that break point here when he hits the wall.

1510
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:23,700
I pretty much believe that that Loop operated as it was intended,

1511
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,100
right?

1512
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,600
So it comes out, here comes out here and does its update.

1513
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:37,899
If we go right, does its little dance for the facing Direction, which

1514
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:38,500
is fine.

1515
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:39,700
And

1516
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah, and I think that should be it until the next call to move

1517
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,300
player.

1518
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,700
So let's see what happens in that call.

1519
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:56,600
So, in the next call to move player, you come in here and we are GDP.

1520
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,500
Should again be trying to accelerate him into the wall because I was

1521
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,500
pressing straight into the wall - one exactly what we expect we go

1522
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:08,700
through and we compute our stuff as it were mint.

1523
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,800
I'll X is 1 into y.

1524
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:17,000
X is one next hour, I believe that's correct.

1525
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,300
Is that correct?

1526
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:25,500
Yeah, okay.

1527
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,800
Because we're about to expand it by the width of the guy.

1528
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,100
Yeah, so we're checking everything.

1529
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,100
Yep.

1530
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,000
So that's fine.

1531
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,200
So now the question is we should immediately again hit this wall,

1532
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,000
right?

1533
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,500
That's what should happen if I'm not mistaken.

1534
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,000
Oh, and we do not hit the wall.

1535
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,000
We don't hit the wall at all.

1536
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,600
Why do we not hit the wall?

1537
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:53,300
Is it because our velocity was not big enough yet to hit the wall.

1538
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,400
That could be.

1539
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
Certainly, that might be it.

1540
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,900
We may have stopped just short of where the wall is, but I feel like

1541
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,100
we were right on it.

1542
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,800
So if that's the player Delta, why didn't that?

1543
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,700
Why didn't that hit the wall?

1544
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,500
Where is the wall X?

1545
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,100
Would be the real question?

1546
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:14,200
Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to figure out what that value

1547
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,000
actually is.

1548
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,600
So, all right.

1549
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:20,800
So let's go ahead and say, what is the ab style x + AB style?

1550
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,600
Why of that guy?

1551
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,800
So let's, let's let's do this again.

1552
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,300
Run.

1553
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:28,900
Go ahead and run.

1554
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,800
There you are my friend.

1555
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,000
So I'm going to go ahead and stop it in there.

1556
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,600
And I want to see which what the actual position of this wall is.

1557
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:37,900
Oops.

1558
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,600
I should make sure that we're actually looking.

1559
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:45,900
Okay.

1560
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,800
So what is the the wall coordinate here?

1561
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:59,600
What actually is the the max Corner X that we're stopping at its 1.25?

1562
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,800
Right one point 2005.

1563
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,300
So let's find out where we actually move ourselves to when we decide

1564
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,400
that we hit that wall.

1565
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,900
Where are we?

1566
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,800
So we're at one point two, five relative to the tile.

1567
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,700
We are - to away.

1568
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,500
And what's that tile side?

1569
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,600
And M, right?

1570
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:32,600
Tha side, m is 1.4, so that basically, oh, and I guess I

1571
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,100
Yeah, so it's a little bit confusing just because since we do

1572
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:45,300
everything relative in tile space, the 1.2 is how far away from the

1573
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,100
tile.

1574
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,600
You would have to be.

1575
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,200
And I'm not sure exactly where this guy is relative to that right now

1576
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,700
because that's kind of a hard competition to do in one's head.

1577
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,200
But so if the max when X is 1 Point 2, then that means if between two

1578
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,000
tiles, right?

1579
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,800
If between two tiles is 1.4, then basically he should be point to away

1580
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,800
from his current tile, which is exactly what he is.

1581
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:26,700
So he should have hit the wall the next time around and the fact that

1582
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:31,400
he didn't hit, the wall is somewhat troubling I believe.

1583
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,600
So, so yeah, I think we're back to my original thesis, which is we've

1584
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
got a bug or something that we don't a subtlety that we

1585
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,500
Understand.

1586
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,800
This is not a problem with the Epsilon, really.

1587
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,000
This is a problem with the code.

1588
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,700
So if I come in here and I'm going to test this wall again, what I

1589
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,000
want to do is I want to take a look at what happens when we're

1590
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,100
supposed to hit that wall.

1591
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:04,300
So what I'd like to do is say, okay, let's figure out which ABS

1592
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,100
dialects and abs tile why we're on.

1593
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,800
When we do hit this one, right?

1594
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,700
Let's figure out.

1595
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,100
Out which one?

1596
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:10,600
That is.

1597
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,300
So AB style.

1598
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,300
Y is 5 ABS?

1599
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,300
Tell x is 0.

1600
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,200
So ABS tile.

1601
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,700
Why is five ABS tile x is 0, right?

1602
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,500
That's what we're looking at for the one, where he actually does hit

1603
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,200
that wall.

1604
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,200
And so what I will do now is I will let him hit the wall.

1605
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:41,000
In that way that he likes to do and then I will go to the next time

1606
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,700
around.

1607
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,300
And I'm going to step into the case where he is supposed to be

1608
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,000
interacting with that wall.

1609
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,800
So X AB style.

1610
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,300
Why?

1611
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,500
So I want abs too wide to be 5.

1612
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,900
So we're not quite there yet.

1613
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,000
We got to go through these two x's first, right?

1614
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,800
X is 2.

1615
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,800
Let's finish that up.

1616
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,200
Let's see.

1617
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,700
Oh, no, I missed it.

1618
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,600
This the so slow.

1619
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,600
Iterating watch window is so frustrating.

1620
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,000
Gah.

1621
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,100
All right, do it again.

1622
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,400
Thank you Visual Studio, like apparently, it's an unsolved problem in

1623
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,400
computer Graphics to update the watch window when I hit step.

1624
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,600
It's just so ridiculous, how bad it is.

1625
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,900
All right.

1626
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,400
So we've hit it once and now we're going to go again, right?

1627
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,400
And now I'm going to go ahead and run in here.

1628
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,700
So that's 0 for 1, 4 2, 4, 0, 5.

1629
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,500
So this is the one we want to know about.

1630
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,200
We come in here and let's see.

1631
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:59,300
So, we've got our relative player location.

1632
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Let's see what that is.

1633
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,700
Our relative their location and arm in corner or Max corner.

1634
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,000
Let's take a look at what all our values are here.

1635
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,600
So, here's relative position is apparently higher than what?

1636
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:14,900
I thought.

1637
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:15,500
It was.

1638
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,800
He's got a little ways to go, but it looked to me when we actually did

1639
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:25,600
the computation before it looked to me like he didn't.

1640
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,000
So what what is going on here?

1641
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:35,100
What's the, what's the what's the issue if you will, what's our test

1642
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:35,900
tile P.

1643
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,200
What's our test?

1644
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:37,800
I'll pee.

1645
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,300
It's 050.

1646
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:46,900
And 0 0 which is what we expect and what's our player or entity P DP.

1647
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,800
What's that are offset?

1648
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,000
so that

1649
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,800
that's a different offset than I thought we ended with before, right.

1650
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,300
Am I imagining things?

1651
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,000
I thought we ended with a totally different.

1652
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,900
I thought we ended with a totally different entity P than that last

1653
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:11,300
time.

1654
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,400
Alright, let's step through it one more time.

1655
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,300
So, there is going into the wall.

1656
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,200
Which one am I going to stop at?

1657
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,600
Mustapha?

1658
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,100
I'm here.

1659
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,500
So there I've hit the wall, right?

1660
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,100
And now I'm going to do my update step to hear update.

1661
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,700
What's my entity P?

1662
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,600
That was the entity P.

1663
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,800
We were supposed to get.

1664
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,600
So what happened to our entity pee?

1665
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,700
Why is it our entity P.

1666
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,900
Did it get changed in the second time through the loop?

1667
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,100
Because it shouldn't touch the X, right.

1668
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,500
So what happened here?

1669
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,400
It did touch the X.

1670
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
It did.

1671
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,000
What?

1672
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,700
Ah, oh the bugginess.

1673
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,400
Oh, did you see it?

1674
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,300
Oh, it's so awful.

1675
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,300
I forgot.

1676
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,000
I said I was gonna get rid of old player piano.

1677
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,600
I didn't oh, the pain and suffering.

1678
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,300
You saw it, didn't you?

1679
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,300
Oh man.

1680
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:23,500
Boy.

1681
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,900
I'm glad I stepped through that.

1682
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,200
That was a good one.

1683
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,200
Not to leave in there.

1684
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,900
Hey, look, it's perfect now.

1685
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,700
Oh, that was terrible.

1686
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,200
That was terrible.

1687
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,200
It's coming out.

1688
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,000
The owl is coming out, people that was a bad typos.

1689
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,600
And I almost left it into.

1690
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,300
I was like, that's not the final conductor.

1691
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,300
Well, it's not the final Collision detector.

1692
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:48,100
It's true, but you shouldn't leave that garbage in there.

1693
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,400
That's just awful.

1694
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,900
Oh, that was bad.

1695
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:51,700
All right.

1696
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,100
Looks like we're fine now.

1697
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,900
Nope, no more cause for alarm.

1698
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,600
I wasn't happy with what was going on in there at all.

1699
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,900
That was just bad news.

1700
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,100
So, the other thing that I was thinking about is, I don't know if we

1701
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,200
want the maybe the acceleration to determine which way the guy is

1702
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,800
facing because it's a little weird right now the way that it's working

1703
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,000
with the velocity, but I don't know.

1704
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,300
All right, so I'm glad we push through that.

1705
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,100
We can go ahead and and actually go to the Q&A now.

1706
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,300
Wow, okay.

1707
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,100
So yeah, that took an extra 20 minutes of De bugging.

1708
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,300
Time to find one typo.

1709
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,000
Yeah, but that's what you get for putting in typos in your code.

1710
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,100
So, okay.

1711
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,900
We're pretty clean.

1712
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:37,900
Now.

1713
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:42,700
I don't think we've got any more problems with that and hey, it's a

1714
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:43,600
lot easier to skate through.

1715
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,100
Now, even with a rectangular Collision.

1716
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,500
It's way easier to skate through those doorways.

1717
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,400
Which again is why sliding is so important.

1718
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,100
You don't think about it that much when you're playing games, but

1719
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:54,900
being able to

1720
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Slide smoothly along walls is like really important, right?

1721
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,400
It's what makes it fun and easy to play a game and not feel super

1722
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,000
janky.

1723
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,700
So it's super important to get that slide in there.

1724
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,600
So it's worth the effort, trust me.

1725
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,700
So anyway, and it'll be even better when we have a circular dude

1726
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,300
because then the normal that you're pushing off on will sort of help

1727
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,700
you slide into doorways easier better as well.

1728
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,900
All right, so I think we're all good.

1729
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,700
Let's go ahead and go to the Q&A, please prefix, York.

1730
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:25,800
Questions with Q:.

1731
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,500
So I will be able to see them.

1732
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,300
And please keep your questions stuff.

1733
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,400
We've done today streamer on previous streams.

1734
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,200
Yay.

1735
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,600
That'll be pushed through that.

1736
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,100
Why is the heroes head 1.5 meters in DM in diameter?

1737
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,900
I feel like it shouldn't actually be quite that big.

1738
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,200
So like I said, the hero is too big right now.

1739
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,600
He was is going to Get shrunk down a bit.

1740
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,600
But he's a bit Anime styled as you can see.

1741
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,800
So his head is going to be ridiculously large compared to everything

1742
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,500
in the world.

1743
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,600
I'm a web developer developer and was taught not to have more than a

1744
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,200
couple hundred lines profile.

1745
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,600
Why isn't the game split up into smaller?

1746
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:41,000
Excuse me.

1747
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,400
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

1748
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,500
I skipped over question there.

1749
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,600
If I recall right then in a prior episode you were talking about how

1750
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,400
the makowsky difference is good solution for finding collections.

1751
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,300
Only between convex.

1752
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:53,100
Polygons can also be a good solution for concave polygons.

1753
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,800
If you have something else planned for that case.

1754
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,300
Also, if you are planning on using Mankowski, differences for concave

1755
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:02,000
Coalition geometry, is it also good solution in 3-D, or are there

1756
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
better alternatives to handle the additional Dimension?

1757
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,400
So the minkowski stuff works the same in 3D as 2D.

1758
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,300
It's Dimension agnostic, which is really nice.

1759
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:15,300
And the way that pretty much everyone universally like in every game

1760
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:20,200
I've ever heard of in the history of time handles convex Collision is

1761
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,800
to break them up into concave pieces.

1762
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,400
That is almost always the solute solution.

1763
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:30,700
So basically what you do is you always just use context collision and

1764
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:34,800
you break up concave things into convex pieces because you can always

1765
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,800
take any concave shape and with enough splits split it into something

1766
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,500
convex.

1767
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:41,800
So that's how that works.

1768
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,500
I'm a web developer who was always taught not to have more than a

1769
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,100
couple hundred lines for file.

1770
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,000
Why isn't the game split up into smaller and more modular files?

1771
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,900
So, two things, one.

1772
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,500
Is that files have nothing to do with modularity, right?

1773
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:02,800
So modularity is about whether or not the functions in something are

1774
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,500
able to be called separate from other functions.

1775
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,400
That's what modularity, like modularity is about reuse.

1776
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,700
It's about whether or not I can reuse a

1777
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:10,900
Thing.

1778
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,400
Obviously, I'm only doing one game here.

1779
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,600
So I don't care about linking to other games, but I do care about

1780
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,000
using stuff in multiple places.

1781
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,500
And so really modularity is about what I break out into functions.

1782
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,600
It has nothing to do with files.

1783
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,100
Files are a particular are purely arbitrary construct, right?

1784
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,300
The actual code itself, doesn't care about files.

1785
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,200
Files are meaningless.

1786
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,500
And so really you should never think about how big a file is.

1787
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,100
Unless it's something that you care about in terms of legibility.

1788
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:39,800
So,

1789
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,900
The extent that I care about files, I only care about them in the

1790
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,300
sense that I like to look at two things side by side.

1791
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,700
So the only real thing I do with files is I say, I like to split stuff

1792
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,900
apart when I want to be able to look at one thing on one side.

1793
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,800
And one thing on the other side.

1794
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:56,200
That is the only thing that matters for files for me.

1795
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,600
If it wasn't for that.

1796
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,800
I just put everything in one file because it just me.

1797
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
Your to keep track of Rights only one file.

1798
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,300
You don't when you want to copy the source code around you, copy 1C

1799
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:04,800
PP, right?

1800
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,600
That'd be way better.

1801
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,200
So the Dogma that you have to break things into lots of small files.

1802
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,500
I would just say, what's the benefit?

1803
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,100
What are you?

1804
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,000
What are you possibly getting out of that?

1805
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,900
You know that because the compiler doesn't care at all.

1806
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:19,800
Right.

1807
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,400
And so what is it that you think you were getting out of that?

1808
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,000
You know, what is it that you wanted to get out of that?

1809
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,900
And and if there was something valid, if you were getting

1810
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,300
Out of that.

1811
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,500
Could you get it another way?

1812
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,300
Would be my thing because I just don't I don't think the the huge file

1813
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,400
proliferation is good thing.

1814
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,800
Plus we also use a Unity built here because the more files you try to

1815
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:40,800
push through the compiler.

1816
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,300
The slower it gets that's just the way compilers work.

1817
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,100
Unfortunately.

1818
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,900
So having monolithic files actually helps there as well, but that's

1819
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,500
separate issue.

1820
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,800
Is the alpha channel in the art assets, created by the artist, or do

1821
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,900
you create them with a tool?

1822
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:00,800
Alpha channels are generally automatically handled in the art package.

1823
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,300
So basically what happens is when the artist draws it fills in Alpha

1824
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,200
as well as color.

1825
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,000
So when they draw you get the alpha Channel, plus the color

1826
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,400
automatically, that's how that works.

1827
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,000
So it's already kind of in the source assets.

1828
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,700
How many years since you started doing games?

1829
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,600
I mean, I think this is really, really hard.

1830
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,600
Yeah, I mean, this is a more advanced.

1831
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,000
Obviously.

1832
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,100
This handmade hero is is showing real game programming.

1833
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,200
It's not showing beginner game programming.

1834
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:41,000
I am walking through every single thing that we do.

1835
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,200
So, in that sense, it's beginner, but we're not pulling any punches.

1836
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,700
Like, we're actually looking at the actual stuff that the CPU has to

1837
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,800
do to run a game.

1838
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,000
We're not just like saying, oh, instantiate object and let Unity like,

1839
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,600
figure out the rest, right?

1840
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,700
And so, yes, that can be kind of difficult because there's a lot that

1841
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:02,000
you have to learn, but you should learn a lot.

1842
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,700
If you want to be an engine programmer, right?

1843
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:07,000
If you don't, then you can kind of just gloss over this stuff which is

1844
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:07,800
fine, right?

1845
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,500
Hand made here is still probably useful because you can see all the

1846
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,400
stuff that's involved and maybe you don't totally understand it.

1847
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,100
But at least now, you know, and so you'll be better when your partner

1848
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,300
with other things, but yes, it is difficult.

1849
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I don't, I don't pretend that it's not.

1850
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,400
There's just a lot to know.

1851
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,400
It's one of the reasons that there are so few game engine programmers

1852
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:25,900
out there.

1853
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:31,700
And so and fewer still good ones is because it's, it definitely is

1854
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,600
something that takes a lot of study and it takes a lot of practice to

1855
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,300
be good at.

1856
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,100
Orlando Bloom, I've never actually done this kind of collision

1857
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:41,600
detection.

1858
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,900
I always just hope the frame rate would stay high enough that the

1859
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,100
velocity would be smaller than the Collision size and that's totally a

1860
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,500
valid approach, right?

1861
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,100
You just have to actually go ahead and make sure that's true.

1862
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:54,900
Right?

1863
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,800
And it does put bounds on the sizes.

1864
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,500
That things can be.

1865
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,800
You can't make sizes too small.

1866
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,100
Are you have to start subdividing?

1867
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:05,900
Your time steps, but you can do that if you want to write, but it's

1868
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,500
not that hard to do it this way.

1869
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,100
So, you know, basically you can think about it.

1870
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,300
Here's one way to think about it.

1871
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,500
Iteration.

1872
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,800
Will happen.

1873
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,100
Right.

1874
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,400
Iteration will happen.

1875
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,800
So, you have a choice of where, that iteration happens?

1876
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,700
One place I could happen is in frames.

1877
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,000
So, the way that your Collision sector works is, it's essentially,

1878
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,900
each frame is an iteration of the glitter cousin detection, right?

1879
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:42,500
And that's what you were just talking about.

1880
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:43,400
Another way.

1881
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,100
It could happen.

1882
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,700
Is by subdividing, your time steps, right?

1883
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,000
So you can say, well, these are my frames, but I know Mike.

1884
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,100
Listen, sector needs to be able to detect objects that are smaller

1885
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:52,500
than the velocities on these frames.

1886
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,300
So I'm going to subdivide it and do a couple iterations of the physics

1887
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,900
per frame, right?

1888
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,400
And that's one way this is more efficient than this, in some sense

1889
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:04,000
because it means that for the same Collision,

1890
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,200
You're doing less work.

1891
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,000
In this case than you would be doing in this case.

1892
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,500
Because in this case, your frame rate itself has to be this High to be

1893
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:17,600
as robust as this is out of as a frame rate.

1894
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,800
That is much less.

1895
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:19,400
Right?

1896
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,200
Hmm.

1897
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,800
And then the final way is the iteration only happens inside the

1898
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:24,700
Collision system.

1899
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,400
So the physics and the the game still only happen at these frame

1900
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,100
boundaries.

1901
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,600
But inside they're just the Collision is iterating.

1902
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,600
And so one reason that it's better, I think.

1903
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,100
Think to have your Collision system, be do sort of it.

1904
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,700
The checking perfectly inside it is because that means that the

1905
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,400
iteration happens at the smallest possible Loop scale.

1906
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,000
So you're doing the least possible work per iteration and then lofting

1907
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
everything else up to to that sort of a larger time scale, which is

1908
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
good for performance.

1909
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:55,600
I feel like

1910
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,800
Can't you have multiple views of the same file with e Max you can, but

1911
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,700
it's janky.

1912
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,200
You've probably already answers a dream, but I haven't been able to

1913
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:11,000
watch a lot of them.

1914
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,300
And as far as I know, the Q&A Parts aren't put on YouTube.

1915
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:15,500
The Q&A parts are all on YouTube.

1916
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,700
They just happen right after the video.

1917
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:20,600
So if you jump one hour into any of the videos, the Q&A is there.

1918
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,500
What are you wearing on your hands O?

1919
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:24,700
The Bots will answer it.

1920
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:25,900
The Bots will answer it for you.

1921
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,500
The hands question for the Makowski calculation will be still be able

1922
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:33,300
to use the same procedure for rotating hitbox or for diagonal space

1923
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,100
for the rotating case, would we have to apply a transform to all the

1924
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,300
Collision of geometry to reflect a larger profile?

1925
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,700
So that's an excellent question.

1926
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,000
The answer is, it depends whether you're talking about animated

1927
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,600
rotation, or static rotation?

1928
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:58,400
Okay, so essentially minkowski doesn't care if you're rotated

1929
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,500
minkowski's fine, with

1930
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:00,600
Right.

1931
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:05,100
So let's say I had a rotated rectangle, and another rectangle that was

1932
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,100
rotated or something.

1933
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,600
Right?

1934
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,900
The same sweep, still works, right?

1935
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,700
The same sweep.

1936
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:14,700
Totally works in minkowski terms, right?

1937
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,400
You still just get the exact right shape.

1938
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,100
The only difference is it's no longer a rectangle, right?

1939
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,500
So there you go.

1940
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,300
So it's like an octagon or whatever.

1941
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:31,000
So Mankowski still works Mankowski, works just fine.

1942
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:33,300
With static rotation.

1943
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,300
Our cheesy implementation that we just did were all we did was handled

1944
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:38,900
right rectangles.

1945
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:43,900
Anyway, obviously won't work, but gjk would work in this case, just

1946
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,400
fine, what?

1947
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,700
Mankowski cannot handle is animated rotation.

1948
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,200
So let's say that.

1949
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:54,600
I've got a guy who's rotating over the time step.

1950
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:58,500
So he rotates from here to here, right?

1951
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,800
Minkowski can't handle that properly.

1952
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,700
Because that is, I mean, well, and to be fair, to be totally fair to

1953
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,500
Mankowski.

1954
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:18,300
Minkowski would still work like real Mankowski.

1955
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,200
Would still work because you just Envision this as a three-dimensional

1956
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,600
Extrusion where time was along the other axis, right?

1957
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:29,700
So if you imagine what you were doing, here's time, here's to D.

1958
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:33,900
I've got this thing and I know I'm going from here to here where it's

1959
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:37,600
rotated and I've generated this swept volume that kind of looks like

1960
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,700
that, right?

1961
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,000
And then Mankowski would say.

1962
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,200
Oh, yeah, just do the intersection test of

1963
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,900
That with whatever the other thing is that you're trying to intersect

1964
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,800
it with and hey, it just works and that's true.

1965
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,200
The problem.

1966
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,200
And the reason that we can't do this.

1967
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:56,800
Is because it creates a concave shape.

1968
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,300
And it creates a concave shape that there's really no way to subdivide

1969
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:06,100
other than subdividing it like in two time steps again.

1970
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:11,000
So minkowski, the only place that Mankowski really can't help you in

1971
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,300
terms of the in efficient implementations of it that we use that are

1972
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,000
based on concavity and that are based on convexity.

1973
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,400
The reason that that Things Fall Apart is just because that convexity

1974
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,300
during that animated rotation, but that's only for animated rotation.

1975
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:30,700
So, if you were willing to say that, a 60th of a second, I don't care

1976
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,100
about the small amount of rotation that's going to happen and I'll

1977
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:37,500
just use either the beginning or ending rotation as my sweep.

1978
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,600
Then it would work fine.

1979
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:43,000
But if you actually need for some reason need to encapsulate That

1980
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:46,100
animated sweep in your closing section.

1981
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,200
It doesn't work anymore and you have to have alternate strategies.

1982
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:57,900
I don't know of any one, step solution that works for for rotating

1983
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:58,400
shapes.

1984
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,800
I feel like at that point.

1985
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,900
You're in a very difficult place.

1986
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,800
I would recommend never getting into a position where you had to

1987
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:10,300
handle that 100% animated like that because that sounds really tough.

1988
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,700
I feel like you're I feel like you always want to try if you can to

1989
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:18,000
make it so that it's okay to just subdivide to a few discrete

1990
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,900
orientations that you care about and do the test against those.

1991
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,100
I feel like that's

1992
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,200
really the only probably saying way unless someone knows an algorithm.

1993
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,800
It's really awesome that I don't know about.

1994
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,800
How long have you been working on this current game?

1995
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:38,100
50 hours is how long we have worked on the game so far.

1996
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,900
So a little over one week of programming time, but that's with

1997
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:43,600
explanations.

1998
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,200
So if you were actually the map it into my actual programming time and

1999
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:51,100
probably be something like, I don't know, 20 hours, 10 hours or

2000
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:51,800
something like that.

2001
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,300
Is it possible to make a cert so that it is possible to continue on

2002
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:02,400
assertion failure?

2003
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,100
Yes.

2004
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:05,100
We haven't done that yet.

2005
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,000
But obviously you can do that.

2006
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:10,900
That is not something we have done, we could do that in a future

2007
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,700
stream, but it hasn't been particularly important.

2008
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:22,800
Are you doing any cyclomatic complexity analysis?

2009
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:30,800
I have no idea what cyclomatic means, cyclomatic.

2010
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,200
I don't think I've ever heard that.

2011
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,500
If you want to tell me what cyclomatic means, I could answer the

2012
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:37,000
question.

2013
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,400
How would you represent a large?

2014
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,500
Side-scrolling open world 2D where the character is basically just

2015
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:50,900
walking along the ground.

2016
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:54,600
So not really a platformer, but almost feels like a tile map would be

2017
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:58,600
a waste of vertical space between parallel paths, one high above

2018
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,700
another double linked list triple for branching path nodes.

2019
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,300
I guess comes to mind but are apparently not good performance wise,

2020
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,300
any ideas.

2021
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:11,600
So I would just use I would say hang on till we get to how we're

2022
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,100
actually going to represent the world fully at the end of this because

2023
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,300
I suspect they'll it'll basically be the same as you would use for a

2024
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:22,200
platformer, which is basically sparse possess placed things in the

2025
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:22,900
world.

2026
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,000
Is probably the best way to do it.

2027
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,400
Tile map is more what we're using for thinking about how we're

2028
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,800
generating the world.

2029
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,500
And I'm not, I'm just not sure yet exactly what we're going to do, but

2030
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,600
I suspect we'll do something that's closer to what you would actually

2031
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,500
want the Platformers.

2032
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:34,800
Well.

2033
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,300
Is it possible to will you be considering trying to determine the

2034
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:47,800
point of collision?

2035
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,100
We are we do.

2036
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,000
That's what we do.

2037
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,200
That's what we just did.

2038
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
So that's this.

2039
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,000
This is the code that determines the point of collision.

2040
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,800
And so we are.

2041
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,600
We are accurately doing that now.

2042
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,200
That's that's exactly what's going on.

2043
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,300
Seems like the inability to robustly represent rotations and physics

2044
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,800
is why complex physics and modern games.

2045
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,800
So busted all the time.

2046
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:23,000
It might be but there's other problems when you're doing a General

2047
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:23,800
Physics engine.

2048
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,800
It's usually honestly rotation is usually not the worst of your

2049
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,400
problems.

2050
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,700
It's usually contact.

2051
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:38,700
Contact is usually where stuff gets really, really bad, but you're

2052
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:39,000
right.

2053
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,400
That rotation is a big problem.

2054
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,300
It's just not the Collision detection of it.

2055
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:47,500
It's the fact it's rotations non-linearity as it applies to contact.

2056
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,700
That's the real bad news.

2057
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,500
Real bad news.

2058
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,800
So we at the end of questions, I don't see any more questions.

2059
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,000
Oh, I meant determining the okay.

2060
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,900
I see, greenish.

2061
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,500
I meant determining the point of collision with the general gjk,

2062
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,200
algorithm.

2063
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:26,900
Yes, we probably will do that again.

2064
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:29,600
I don't actually know if we'll do gjk.

2065
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:34,000
I just assumed that gjk will be the most efficient thing for us to do,

2066
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,100
but we could also do hand coded.

2067
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:44,000
So, for example, the Collision detector in braids, I I wrote the

2068
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,400
question chapter in braids as well.

2069
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,200
And the way that it worked is, it's a hand coated rounded, rectangle

2070
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:50,500
one.

2071
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,700
So the way that it works is it stores.

2072
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:59,800
Everything as the, as the sum of a square and a circle and it does all

2073
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:03,500
of the collisions by hand in hand coded things that can do like Ray

2074
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,600
casting versus this and overlap testing versus this and so on.

2075
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:13,000
So it's possible and braid is the only 2D game that I ever had any

2076
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:13,500
code in.

2077
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,700
I think that I know of anyway,

2078
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:21,000
a collision detection wise and so maybe we do something like that

2079
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,800
because it worked pretty well in that game, but I don't know, you

2080
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,600
know, like we'll see.

2081
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,100
Are we doing a Raspberry Pi Port?

2082
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:30,800
Just for the heck of it?

2083
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,200
Or is there a deeper reason behind it?

2084
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:32,600
Yes.

2085
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,500
The reason that we're doing a Raspberry Pi port, or I don't know if

2086
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,600
we're going to do a Raspberry Pi Port, but we're going to do a port to

2087
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:42,500
some platform where everything is spect and we can boot straight to

2088
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:45,800
the game with no operating system and Raspberry Pi at the moment is

2089
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,900
just the best platform for that that I could find if there's a faster

2090
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:53,100
if there's like a more powerful piece of Hardware, two years from now

2091
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,300
when we're done with the game and it comes time to do a Raspberry Pi

2092
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,400
version, then we'll do that version instead.

2093
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,900
but right now, as far as I know the

2094
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,500
Very pies.

2095
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:03,800
The only thing that does that and so I will be looking for other

2096
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,700
options in Raspberry Pi.

2097
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:08,700
The Raspberry Pi is not necessarily something that I have any specific

2098
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:13,700
affinity for other than just, it's completely documented and you can

2099
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:17,100
boot straight into the OS straight into your game with no OS and

2100
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,000
that's what I wanted.

2101
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:30,000
Cyclomatic complexity a direct measure of the number of linearly

2102
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,500
independent paths through the code know.

2103
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And we never will do that analysis either.

2104
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:48,100
So it looks like we are at the end of the questions and of questions.

2105
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:49,800
So I think that's about it.

2106
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:54,500
Beaglebone black better than Raspberry Pi.

2107
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,700
I think someone was saying yes, but beaglebones aren't documented.

2108
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,500
Am I wrong about that?

2109
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,800
Let's find out.

2110
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:09,300
Right.

2111
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:10,600
What?

2112
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,100
Which 3D graphics accelerator?

2113
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,000
Is it in the beaglebone?

2114
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,600
Black?

2115
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:28,100
Like basically, if, if they do not have full the full documentation

2116
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:30,800
from the hardware manufacturer of the 3D Graphics later than it's not

2117
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:31,600
useful to us.

2118
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,600
Right?

2119
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,000
And so, I don't know if they do or not.

2120
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:39,900
So you have to look up is the 3D graphs alerted fully documented on

2121
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:43,800
the beaglebone black and I mean fully as in no driver required.

2122
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,700
We can write directly to the hardware and have full access to all its

2123
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:49,300
capabilities.

2124
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:51,600
Because you can do that on the pie.

2125
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:55,000
So if you can do that on the beaglebone black we might consider it,

2126
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
but otherwise not.

2127
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,600
Ryan riess.

2128
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,800
Can't you do that on a PC?

2129
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,900
Write yourself a boot sector.

2130
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,600
Put it on a USB stick and boot straight into your game with no s.

2131
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:10,100
No, you can't.

2132
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,900
And the reason that you can't is because the graphics cards aren't

2133
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:15,600
documented.

2134
01:41:15,900 --> 01:41:17,500
So you can't actually use them.

2135
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:22,500
You can sort of use them, you can have to use them and try to go from

2136
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:26,200
the reverse engineered stuff and kind of maybe use them.

2137
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,900
But I want a machine that's entirely documented so that we will be

2138
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,400
able to use the entire machine.

2139
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,300
And not have to tiptoe around and videos NDA or something.

2140
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,300
Well, not NDA trade secrets that they won't even tell us how to

2141
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,600
program, you know, the card or whatever.

2142
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:42,900
Right?

2143
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,300
Because that's just lame.

2144
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,700
All right, so I think that's it for today.

2145
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,900
I am going to say that we have finished our stream.

2146
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:58,000
Thank you very much for joining me here for breakfast time, handmade

2147
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:58,500
hero.

2148
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,800
I'm glad our Collision sector.

2149
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,100
Now, working smoothly.

2150
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:02,900
I like the feel of this as well.

2151
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,700
I like how I like, how it works.

2152
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,700
I feel like

2153
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,100
I feel like how we want the player to move, might change a little bit

2154
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,300
because next week I'd like to do what I'd like to do.

2155
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,800
Next week is get animation going for the guy so that he hops, you

2156
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,000
know, long as he moves and as we play with that, we're going to have

2157
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,200
to see how we want it to feel in terms of how it goes.

2158
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,700
And when I say we, I really mean me because all of the movements going

2159
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,100
to be tuned, so that I like it.

2160
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:32,000
And I know there's a bunch of different people have different

2161
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,800
preferences of how movement systems work.

2162
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,500
So I can't really promise that it'll be the way other people might

2163
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,200
want it to feel, but

2164
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,400
Be the way, I want it to feel.

2165
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:42,100
And of course, one of the nice things about handmade hero is all the

2166
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,900
source code is available if the game ships and you don't like the

2167
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:46,400
movement.

2168
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,400
Well, that is a perfect reason to study up on the series.

2169
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,400
Learn how to fix it and go in and change it to how you want it to

2170
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,300
work, right?

2171
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,500
So that's pretty cool.

2172
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,100
Anyway, thank you very much for joining me for this episode of

2173
01:42:58,100 --> 01:42:59,000
handmade Hira.

2174
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:01,900
It was a pleasure coding with you as always.

2175
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,300
And if you would like to follow along at home with the source code,

2176
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:08,000
you can pre-order the game on handmade here a.org, and it comes with

2177
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:08,200
all this.

2178
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,100
This code, you can download it every night from a link that you'll get

2179
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:11,800
in your email.

2180
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,100
And it also comes with the debug assets that we've been using, you

2181
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,700
know, the little guy and the backdrop and that sort of thing.

2182
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,200
So, you can go ahead and and pre-order that if you want access to all

2183
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:24,000
that stuff, if you want to just support the video series, there's a

2184
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,500
patreon that you could subscribe to.

2185
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,000
And if you're trying to follow along at home and learn from the

2186
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,400
series, there's a news and Forum site that I highly recommend checking

2187
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,000
it out.

2188
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:32,700
It's got the schedule for the week every week.

2189
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,900
So you can go look.

2190
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,900
For example, I'll post the schedule for next week, next Monday.

2191
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,800
So you can see where it went.

2192
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,600
All the times will be.

2193
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,500
There's an episode guide allows you to catch up with past episodes and

2194
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,100
it's got good Mark time markers and stuff that people contribute,

2195
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:46,700
those coding resources page that Sports to Linux and Mac, if you're

2196
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,400
trying to follow along a different platform.

2197
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:51,400
And finally, there's a discussion board that you can go to the allows

2198
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:53,600
you to ask questions and talk about the series with other people.

2199
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,700
And it's also a place where people help me out.

2200
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,800
If they spot typos in the code, they'll post them here.

2201
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,300
And that's helped tremendously to have other people watching.

2202
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:03,900
Because when I'm talking on the stream, I can't always concentrate on

2203
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:06,300
the code that well on really, it helps.

2204
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:08,200
So, thank you everyone who writes in and says, hey, you forgot.

2205
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:09,100
Got to do blah.

2206
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:11,600
That's that's really helpful to me and helps make sure that we don't

2207
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,600
spend a ton of time on the stream tracking down typos.

2208
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,700
So, that's it for today.

2209
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,600
I will be back Monday, probably 8 p.m.

2210
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,300
PST on Monday.

2211
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:22,900
So, I hope to see you all there.

2212
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,900
Have an excellent weekend, if I don't see you guys somewhere online.

2213
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:28,600
Thanks, everyone.
