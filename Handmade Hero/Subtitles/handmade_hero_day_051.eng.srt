1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,500
Okay.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,000
The only show available on planet Earth on the whole, perhaps even in

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,800
the whole universe.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,600
We do not know how far these radio waves may be traveling right now

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,300
across the galaxies.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,300
The only place where aliens on Mars, should they exist can tune in in

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,000
some sense if they had some magical way of doing, so to the the place

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
where a entire game is coded from scratch using

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,200
No engines, no libraries.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,900
They said that, that was absolutely crazy.

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,500
But how crazy really is it at the end of the day?

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,200
I think we've totally proven that.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
It's possible.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,900
It's not only possible, but it actually, has some pretty awesome

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,800
benefits to it.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:51,400
One of them being that we get to kind of muck around in, in all of the

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,400
sort of crazy, underlying stuff and do cool things, like the looped

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Live code editing and that sort of stuff that really, you know, you

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
would never get a chance to play with.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,100
It's too much fun.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,400
But I don't know.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,100
That's just me.

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,700
Maybe everyone else thinks is crazy, but I still think it's a good

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,900
idea and I think the martians on Mars, probably agree with me when the

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,700
rover finds them.

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,200
They're going to be like, I'm so glad somebody finally did a series.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,100
It wasn't using an engine.

29
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,200
That's probably what they're going to say.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,100
At least I'm fairly certain.

31
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:16,900
but,

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
Not everything can be for Martian.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,200
So sometimes we got to talk about other stuff which is stuff.

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
You got to think about whether you're doing an engine or anything

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,600
else.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,900
And so that's what we got to do today.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,900
Now, I want to quickly take one moment to say but here we are on day

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,700
51.

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
If you have pre-ordered the game you can unzip day 50s Source zip.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,900
You should have gotten a link in your email.

41
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,600
And if you go to that link, you can download both the test assets that

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,300
we've been using and a zip file that has everyday source code in its

43
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,600
own little private zip.

44
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,500
Unzip day 50, and you will be where I am.

45
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,000
Day so that you can follow along at home if that is something that you

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
want to do, and I highly recommend it because following along at home

47
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
is the best way to learn.

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I would say, and tinkering with stuff is certainly a very good way to

49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,700
learn and so that's a very good way to do that.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Anyway, so let's talk about some of those things that the Martians

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
have been waiting for me to talk about.

52
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,400
Basically, we are at the point where we sort of implemented a

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,600
rudimentary Collision detector.

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,500
That does some of the things that we need, you know, it can glide

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,000
along walls and that sort of stuff and we can move our guy around.

56
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,000
But we have at this point.

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,900
We kind of have to open up into a new area of development.

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,800
Because like I said, right now, what we're doing is, we're sort of

59
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,200
getting basic pieces, all the basic pieces in place and seeing how

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,900
they work, so that we can go start writing about, full like shippable

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,700
Quality Engine versions of each one.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Until we actually have one of everything in place.

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,200
I'd typically don't like to do that.

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,500
I like I said, we want to explore the code first.

65
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,100
I want to know how everything fits together, and then I go start

66
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,300
writing, sort of the industrial-strength version of things, but the

67
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,600
problem is now I'm not sure what the next best thing to do would be to

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,900
do at this point.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,800
My there's really two separate.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Areas that I want to tackle and they're sort of independent.

71
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,700
One area is animation.

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,000
Like I said, I really want to animate this guy, right?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,400
I want him to hop along when he when he moves and that sort of stuff.

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,300
So, I want to sort of put in an animation system because that's a big

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,200
key component that I want to have in there so we can see how it works.

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,700
So we know what it's requirements are and that sort of thing for when

77
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,500
we build the final version, but the other thing is multiple entities.

78
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,100
Now we have obviously I think I still have the the controller over

79
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,400
here.

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:29,900
We

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We have the ability to drop more than one dude in here.

82
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,600
Right?

83
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,200
So we've got another dude, but they don't actually interact in any

84
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,900
way, right?

85
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,600
So they don't Collide and we really don't have any notion of an entity

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,900
system or anything like that.

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Right?

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,600
We've got, we've got nothing of that form whatsoever.

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,700
And so basically what I want to do is say, okay, what exactly are we

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,000
going to do here in terms of of

91
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,600
Of getting multiple entities and that sort of stuff because that's,

92
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,200
that's kind of a big part of the, of the whole shebang.

93
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
And there was also a, you know, a sort of thing that came up the other

94
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,500
night that I was saying, where I really want to get to the point where

95
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,600
we don't have to deal with coordinates all the time that are in the

96
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,300
sort of tilemap Center.

97
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,399
Offset format.

98
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,399
I really wanted it to mostly be the case that entities got packed away

99
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,600
in that format when they were no longer useful from moment to moment.

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,000
And that most of the time what was happening is that entities were

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,900
actually all

102
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,500
Any entities that were involved in the screen that we were on or near

103
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,000
by?

104
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
We're always just in float space.

105
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,200
So that's like a pretty big thing that I'd like to, to tackle as well.

106
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,500
And I just don't know which of these is the most important to tackle.

107
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,800
What?

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,700
I don't want to do is keep going with the Collision Vector, because I

109
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,500
think the Collision detector is, you know, it's, it's pretty janky.

110
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,500
There's no question about that, but there's not a whole lot more that

111
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,400
we need to do to know what it has to do.

112
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,800
And so I feel like going any further down the Collision detector path,

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
like trying to make it actually be robust and nice and good.

114
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
And all that sort of stuff, and support, more different types of

115
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,400
objects in.

116
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Those sorts of things are all stuff.

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,100
That can pretty much be put off till when we actually write the final

118
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,500
version.

119
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I don't think there's anything that's necessarily going to stop us too

120
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,700
much.

121
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,100
So that's that.

122
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,800
So just thinking that through really the point that I'm at right now

123
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,600
is just trying to figure out what do I really want to start doing?

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,000
Now?

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,600
What is the most useful thing to start doing?

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,300
And so I'm thinking that probably what it is is I think it probably is

127
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
the sort of multiple entity kind of more.

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,100
Like let's get the gamey sort of stuff running like an example would

129
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,500
be maybe we have a guy and a little monster that attacks the guy and

130
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,000
there's like health and the health goes down and you know, the monster

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,300
can be off screen or walk on screen these sorts of things and then you

132
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
know monsters that are far away or not getting stimulated at the same

133
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,600
rate, those sorts of things trying to start putting those in.

134
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
In seems like, maybe the better.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And the reason for that is because like I said, I would like to get

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,600
away from that co-ordinate system thing where we're sort of constantly

137
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,900
using these coordinates that I really kind of only intended for

138
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,200
packing and also, you know, we don't really know exactly how we're

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
storing other stuff like World stuff too.

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,500
So, I don't know, there just seems like there's a lot of stuff that

141
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,600
probably wants to get sorted out there, and maybe that's more

142
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
important than animation right now.

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,500
And also animation might How We Do animation might be somewhat

144
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,300
informed, by that.

145
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,600
Because if everything is operating in that float space, that may have

146
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,800
some

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Vacations for how the animation system works and it may make it

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:32,700
easier.

149
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,600
Develop the animation system if we've already cleaned that cruft out.

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,100
I don't know.

151
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,200
So that's what I'm thinking.

152
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,500
That's just off the top of my head.

153
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,000
so,

154
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,700
I think that's probably the best thing to do.

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,300
So, hopefully everyone's at least someone on board with that as a

156
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,000
concept.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
And from there.

158
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,100
I think I'm just going to go ahead and start playing with that and and

159
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
see where we get with it.

160
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,500
Right?

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
I think that's probably the most logical thing to do.

162
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,700
So we'll just spend a couple days getting that sort of part up and

163
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,300
ready and then we can sort of also have a little bit of a, you know,

164
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,100
we kind of see, we walk through the world and there's there's people

165
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,900
in it and that sort of thing.

166
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,100
And we can kind of start to see roughly how that's going to

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
So let's just say that that's something that we want to do.

168
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,600
And let's take stock of where we're at and see what it's going to take

169
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,400
to get us to a point where that sort of stuff starts to happen.

170
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,300
So obviously we've got a tile map system here.

171
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,100
That's that's basically just meant to virtualize a giant map where

172
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,800
there are only exist tiles in some locations, right?

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,100
That's essentially what we wrote here and we decided that we didn't

174
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,400
want it to wrap because we thought rapping was probably not a good

175
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,700
idea.

176
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,100
So we're probably going to get rid of the concept of wrapping for now

177
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,600
though.

178
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,100
We'll see how that goes because it seemed like that was just gonna

179
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,500
introduce bugs and there was no real reason to do it because the world

180
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,100
was so large.

181
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,100
No one could really ever walk from one end of the end for from one end

182
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,600
to the other.

183
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,800
Anyway, that was kind of one of the design ideas behind the fact that

184
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
it was going to be as far as Tom app.

185
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,100
Was that there would be no way you could ever make a world that there

186
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
be no way.

187
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,600
Ever want to make a world larger than what it could support.

188
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,600
So if we ever did want the world to appear to be rapping, what we

189
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
would do is actually just virtualize, sort of like say when you hit

190
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,300
these tiles, you wrap around to another set of tiles or something like

191
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,600
this.

192
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,900
So, given that I have that I guess the sort of the idea that I was

193
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
that I was toying with and that I sort of think is the way I would

194
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,000
like to go with.

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,100
It is instead of always actually doing computations on these tilemap

196
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,400
things and having everyone be represented with these, tilemap

197
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,100
positions that are basically, you know, sort of overkill for most of

198
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,200
the operations we're doing because they're only there to allow us to

199
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,500
have these huge Maps but in

200
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,000
Any given section, we could do all of the operations at float, which

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
is what I want because that's much faster than having deal.

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,400
These time a positions and dealing with wrap the sort of the wrapping

203
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,600
from

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,300
One town to the next like the, you know, the sort of moving from town

205
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,000
of Thailand renormalizing, the offsets and all that stuff.

206
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,100
So, thinking about that, what I'm what I'm sort of in my head

207
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,500
envisioning is sort of this concept that what we have is sort of two

208
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,400
sets of entities, basically, right?

209
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,200
There'd be one set of entities where the entities were actually like

210
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,500
active and they were actually moving around with full floating Point

211
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:29,900
precision.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,300
Ian in the world where we are and then there'd be sort of like I don't

213
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,800
really want them to necessarily be dormant entities because I want

214
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,200
them to still potentially have behaviors but they'd be entities who

215
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,300
exist pretty much solely in tilemap space and are updated at a much

216
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,400
lower frequency.

217
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,600
And so what I'm thinking is like let's say we build a world, you know,

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
and in Crete I could sort of do a little diagram of a little rough

219
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,900
diagram of sort of what I'm thinking about here, which is that suppose

220
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,700
that this

221
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,700
You know, sort of situation here, right?

222
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,000
This is like the screen, right?

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,500
This is what we actually see.

224
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,100
And then there's like an apron around it of stuff that wants to be

225
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,400
simulated, potentially at Full Resolution may be, right.

226
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I mean, I don't know, but let's say that there is.

227
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,600
So basically, everything inside here is like full resolution Sim.

228
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,200
This is full of risks him, right?

229
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
But then everything in the rest of the world.

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
So everything that's not in that, you know.

231
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,100
Apron area, everything else.

232
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
I want to basically be, you know, low-res Sim.

233
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,700
So that basically, we could have, you know, if we wanted to have

234
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,500
10,000 entities out here that weren't really doing anything too

235
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,400
important in terms of their like, s to S stuff, but we still want to

236
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
simulate the maybe they're on routes.

237
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
They're going places and picking up stuff for, you know, doing some

238
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
kind of planning about what they want to do.

239
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,500
Those sorts of things.

240
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,500
They're still doing things, but they're not necessarily doing them

241
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,700
with the same, kind of resolution as these, where they're actually

242
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,300
doing like, you know, full path, finding, and trying to walk around

243
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,400
and look, realistic, as they do it or attack the player.

244
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
And those sorts of things, right?

245
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,300
So I'm thinking that that sort of sort of the thing here, and I don't

246
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,200
know what this number is, right?

247
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,400
I don't really realistically know what this number is.

248
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,900
So one of the things that I don't know if I've really talked about you

249
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,700
much in the series, I do it a lot.

250
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,700
I don't know how useful they are, but I'm going to say what now

251
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000
because it's what I would do here.

252
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,900
There's a thing called a back of the envelope or boat, right?

253
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,600
And it's back of the envelope calculation, right?

254
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,400
And what it basically is, is, I don't know why they call back of the

255
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,100
envelope.

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
I have no idea where that actually comes from.

257
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
I don't know if they're talking about envelope.

258
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,900
Like, you know, like a in the sense of like a performance envelope or

259
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,700
whether they're talking about like this sort of thing.

260
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,000
And like I use the back of an envelope to write down a calculation on

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,200
that.

262
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,400
I didn't particularly care too much about, I have no idea but point

263
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,900
being what it is is its kind of Ball parking, some computation to some

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,500
To give you a sense of what might be possible or to kind of guide your

265
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,000
judgment, but that, you know, is not accurate to any real, like, you

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,300
couldn't use this calculation for any real purpose, because it's, you

267
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,500
know, it's kind of just very fudgy and it's a fudge Factor kind of

268
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:15,800
thing.

269
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,100
And so what I'm kind of wondering it's like, okay, how many entities

270
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,100
might we have?

271
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,400
Like, I don't know what that number is, right, how many entities?

272
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,400
And so the way I like to do this sort of thing is I'll say, okay.

273
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,800
Well, let's say that realistically speaking since this is a generated

274
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,400
game.

275
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,000
You know, I feel like 8 hours is probably like pretty darn long for a

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,200
gameplay session.

277
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,800
Like I feel like, you know, I feel like eight hours is

278
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,500
Longer than you might ever probably want to play a generated guck.

279
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,700
Java generated game games or like four or five hours, but, you know, I

280
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,400
mean, if we were to go crazy, you could imagine 6A someone for some

281
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,100
reason and I have no idea why wants to generate a 60-hour experience

282
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,900
and play like, you know, like a final fantasy length, kind of thing or

283
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,400
whatever.

284
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,200
And then also, you could think the more typical playtime is maybe two

285
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000
hours, right?

286
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,900
One to two hours.

287
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,000
Like I just want to, I want to generate a little game.

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,600
I want to play it.

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
I want to have some fun.

290
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
I don't want it to take all weekend.

291
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,700
And right.

292
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
And so, I feel like that's a pretty reasonable range of things.

293
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,600
Like, you know, that's the min max.

294
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
This is probably the most typical.

295
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,300
This is probably less typical on.

296
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,800
This is probably, I don't know that we ever even care, but it's

297
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,700
something to think about to see what that kind of Maximum bound is

298
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,600
like, is anyone ever going to play 60 hours of one game of handmade

299
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,500
hero knowing that I could die at any time and be done and not, and

300
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,400
have to start a whole new one.

301
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,200
I don't know.

302
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,900
I don't know.

303
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,700
But point being

304
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,300
So if I think about that and I say well, okay, you know realistically

305
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,500
speaking how many enemies do you encounter typically per minute?

306
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,800
Because you know, if we if we look at these right?

307
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,300
What is that?

308
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,500
That's thirty six hundred minutes or something like this that the

309
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,000
person's playing for and in this case, right?

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's what 1480 minutes.

311
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:09,700
I don't know.

312
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,600
Bad with mental math.

313
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
These are probably all wrong hundred twenty eight twenty minutes,

314
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,100
right?

315
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,900
So we're looking at like, you know something that's between

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
A hundred and twenty and thirty six hundred minutes of playtime,

317
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,700
right?

318
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,800
That's what we're looking at here.

319
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,600
And so, if you're talking about how many enemies these, this, this

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,500
player will encounter, you know, let's even if they were encountering,

321
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,400
some very high rate of monsters for this type of game.

322
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,500
It's like as LD kind of walk around game, you're talking four, five,

323
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,100
six enemies.

324
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
On a screen at a time is already getting a little chaotic for the

325
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,400
player to deal with.

326
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
Really if there's enemies that are all meaningful and aren't just kind

327
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
of, you know, throw away.

328
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,600
So, you know, even if we're talking about something like 10 monsters

329
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,700
for screen, which is really high, right.

330
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,900
So if we said something like 10 monsters per screen where we were

331
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,800
talking about, you know, that's a pretty pretty heavy rate and we

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,500
Talking about, you know, maybe even two screens a minute.

333
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,700
So figure, 20 monsters a minute at 20 monsters a minute, you're

334
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,300
already, you know, encountering them.

335
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,800
You're already talking about really less than this.

336
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
This number I already was talking about here, right?

337
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
That's like 72.

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Oh no, it's a little more.

339
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Never mind.

340
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a little more 72,000.

341
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Is that correct?

342
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,500
Right.

343
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,400
You add the zero and x 2.

344
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
So 70,000.

345
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,800
So, so there

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,200
You go.

347
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,300
72,000 would be if we're going to play 60 hours, encounter, 20,

348
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,200
monsters, a minute.

349
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
I think I did that, right.

350
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,800
So 72,000 entities right would be, would be roughly what that is.

351
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
And you know, that's, that's kind of a pretty massive number of

352
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,000
entities.

353
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,300
And so let's think about that number a little bit, right?

354
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,100
If we had 72,000 entities and we're talking about this 20 per minute

355
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,300
thing.

356
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,700
Well, how many screens really are?

357
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,300
They're going to be here, you know, if there's nine even if there was

358
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
something like, even if you're talking

359
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,900
Maybe Thirty hot screens, you're talking about in that working set of

360
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,600
entities.

361
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,000
You're talking about, maybe 600 entities tops, but we're probably

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
talking about a lot less than that.

363
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,800
Right?

364
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,300
I mean, we're probably talking about something more in the range of

365
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,200
like 100 to 200 entities that are in the in that hot range.

366
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,500
So we're talking about simulating, maybe 100 to 200 entities per frame

367
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,400
at the full resolution, which seems like a totally doable number,

368
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,900
right?

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Isn't that doesn't seem to particularly difficult there at all, and

370
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,800
that's a feels pretty.

371
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,100
Hi, but even if it was 600, that doesn't seem like too bad, right?

372
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,900
Especially because a lot of her off scene.

373
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,400
So we don't even have to draw them.

374
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
We just have to know what they were doing.

375
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,300
So that seems totally doable not really a big deal.

376
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Write this number.

377
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
However, in terms of how many are stored externally is a bit of a big

378
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,200
deal because, you know, if you sort of think about how we might want

379
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,500
to how we might deal with that if you were actually simulating 72,000

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,300
guys for frame.

381
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Well, one thing that you can do pretty easily.

382
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
Again, this is sort of that back-of-the-envelope compute computation

383
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,800
stuff.

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,400
If I whip open the calculator here and I say OK on a 3 gigahertz

385
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,900
machine.

386
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,700
That's three times 1000 times, 1000 times 1000, right?

387
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,099
That's how many cycles I've got and I'm running at 60 frames a second,

388
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,500
right?

389
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,000
So that's per second.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So per frame, if I was running at 60 frames a second.

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Let's say I would have what is that about?

392
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
50 million?

393
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,000
50,

394
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,500
In cycles that sound about, right?

395
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,300
So I'd have 50 million Cycles is the total number of cycles that I'd

396
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
actually have right.

397
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,700
So I'd have 50 million cycles per frame to do.

398
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,000
All the work that I need to do.

399
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,700
Right?

400
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,900
And so if you think about taking the 72,000, right?

401
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,500
And I divide my, my number of Cycles by the number of entities, you're

402
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,800
down to a really tiny like seven.

403
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,300
Rinse cycles per entity.

404
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
It just not going to happen.

405
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,000
Right?

406
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,600
It's just totally out of the question because seven hundred Cycles.

407
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,100
I mean, that's only a couple memory, a couple memory fetches, a

408
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,700
couple, a couple things out of the cache and you're already at seven

409
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,800
hundred Cycles, right?

410
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,300
So we pretty much know that that number is never going to happen.

411
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,100
So if you want to scale to that number of entities, we need to have

412
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,500
asked, we need to have something in mind, that's going to handle this.

413
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,300
And so what I expect to do, what I think is the easiest thing to do,

414
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,600
right?

415
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,100
Is to just update these guys at a much lower latency, a much lower

416
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,800
frequency rather than everything else.

417
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,500
So once people move out of The Hot Zone, what I want to do then is

418
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
say, okay from then on once people are out.

419
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,600
Of that Hot Zone.

420
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,900
What I want to do is say they are now going to update, you know, at,

421
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,100
you know, some kind of a, let's say, let's say 1,000 a frame or

422
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,100
something like that or potentially even less because at 1000 of frame,

423
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,100
it would roughly be one.

424
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,800
Second.

425
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,900
I'd update every entity like once a second, right?

426
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,500
And once the second seems like enough for enemies who are just kind of

427
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,300
doing things with with each other, you know, they're basically just

428
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,200
doing stuff outside of the world.

429
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,000
And you know, some portion of these entities might be able to go to

430
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,900
sleep completely if their entities that don't do anything.

431
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,300
Like their enemies that don't have any evolving behavior, that could

432
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,500
make them do something that we care about then we don't have to worry

433
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,900
about them at.

434
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,200
All.

435
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,800
Right.

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So really, this is just, you know, sort of a ballpark number.

437
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,700
Now.

438
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,200
The other thing we have to think about here is storage for these guys.

439
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,200
Right at this at this rate.

440
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,800
Basically, this is 72,000 entities, right?

441
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,200
So 72k, so, you know, it's probably really not that big a deal, but if

442
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,500
we actually were starting to think about well,

443
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
I want to be able to sort of save the game or stuff like this.

444
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,600
It becomes a little tricky because, at 72,000, well, how big is each

445
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,000
of those?

446
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,400
If each of one was say, one kilobyte large, you'd be at 72 megabytes

447
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,200
of memory just for the entities that are not in, you know, that are

448
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,300
just kind of sitting there which on today's machines is nothing.

449
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Like I said, that's totally meaningless, so we could totally do it.

450
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,000
It's not a problem.

451
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,600
But we do have to think about it a little bit for like saving the

452
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:17,900
game.

453
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Do we want the save game file to be 72 bags?

454
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Right?

455
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,000
And I mean, like I said, I don't know that we're supporting saved

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,300
games per se, but we might support like closing the app and reopen it

457
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:27,600
again.

458
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,300
And so you're starting to wonder if that's maybe such a good idea.

459
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,500
I don't know, it probably doesn't matter, but point being something to

460
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,200
think about.

461
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,000
So, sort of what I'm thinking here is saying, okay.

462
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,600
What I want to do is I want to I want to say we're going to have these

463
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,100
two things.

464
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,000
This is how I've been thinking about it in my head, what we've kind of

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,700
got out here.

466
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,700
So what I want to do is I want to say that we've got sort of one set.

467
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,500
That's a relatively small set and then one set that's a pretty big

468
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,000
set.

469
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,200
And these are basically these are the low frequency entities, right?

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,800
And these are the high frequency.

471
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,400
These.

472
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,500
And what I want to do is as the player moves around the world.

473
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,500
What I would like to do is essentially move right entities from the

474
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,000
low frequency set into the high frequency set, right?

475
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,200
So, they kind of they come this way as they become on screen, right?

476
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,700
Or I shouldn't say on-screen, I should say like as they move in range.

477
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,800
So because I'll, you know, I'll probably start simulating them a

478
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
little bit further out and that's just for stuff.

479
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Like if you want to be able to

480
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,300
To hear things in the Next Room that are happening.

481
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Right?

482
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,200
Or stuff like that.

483
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,800
You know, maybe we want them to be simulated, a little higher Acuity,

484
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,300
right?

485
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
So there's the high frequency set and they move in when they come out

486
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
of in range.

487
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,700
And then things will similarly, get moved, you know, out to the low

488
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,600
frequency set when they are out of range, right?

489
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,600
So that's really all I really want to be able to do.

490
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,100
Now, I wanted to talk a little bit about addressing here because this

491
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,700
is kind of something that's relatively important.

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What I wanted to say was so

493
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Entities can have behaviors, that are about that, revolve around or

494
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,100
need to think about other entities, right?

495
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,700
Pretty obvious.

496
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
Like, for example,

497
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,900
If one entity has decided to attack another entity, then typically you

498
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,200
need some way.

499
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
You basically need some kind of a pointer, right?

500
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,500
That is from and one entity to another entity.

501
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
How do I remember?

502
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,000
You know, the The Entity I was talking about, right?

503
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Another example would be like a familiar.

504
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,000
Like if someone's following the player like a Aid, a support player, a

505
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
support entity.

506
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,100
How does it know who it's following?

507
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,000
Because like I said, we're just kind of supporting multiple players.

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,600
We don't know if we'll have

509
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,100
Both players in the game eventually, but you know, we want to do it.

510
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Right.

511
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,200
And similarly.

512
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Maybe the same thing that happened were monsters, like, maybe monsters

513
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
gonna have familiars to, right?

514
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
So, we want to be able to support kind of a generic concept of, like,

515
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,600
I am following this guy.

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Well, in order to follow somebody, right?

517
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,200
I obviously need a way of saying, who the person is that.

518
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,900
I'm following.

519
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,900
And so, we have this need to, basically do a dressing of some kind.

520
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,800
We're inside these structures.

521
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,600
We have the ability to discuss other entities, right?

522
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
So what I'd like to do is I'd like to have some stable addressing

523
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,500
scheme because you can see why this gets a little confusing if I have

524
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,800
high frequency and low frequency entities, right?

525
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Then one thing I definitely don't want to do is have to Loop over this

526
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
entire low-frequency set, right?

527
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,300
Every frame just to find which ones are high frequency, right?

528
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,300
And similarly.

529
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,100
I may not even want to store because like I said, that seventy two

530
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,100
Meg's is looking a little bit dicey there.

531
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,300
I don't know if I want to store all 72, MB of that.

532
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,700
So, if I if the

533
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Tool information, necessary to process a guy at high frequency

534
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,600
happens, to be very detailed and has like his animation State and all

535
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,400
this sort of stuff.

536
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,300
I don't necessarily want to store all that in here, either.

537
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,900
Right?

538
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,000
So, I've kind of got this situation where I have a number of competing

539
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,200
concerns that I need to work out and it would probably be best for

540
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,200
performance and just in general for space efficiency as well.

541
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,300
If we could have entities exist in either place and be able to address

542
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,900
them correctly.

543
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
Ali, no matter which one they're in.

544
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,400
So, basically be able to say I am pointing to an entity somehow.

545
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,500
I am following entity blah and know that I can figure out the things I

546
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,000
need to figure out about him without having to always search one or

547
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,500
the other or do anything weird.

548
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,800
And without forcing me to have everything in a giant index table or

549
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,300
anything like that.

550
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,700
Right?

551
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,300
So I'd like to have a skiing that does that.

552
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,200
And I think probably since the low frequency table, basically has all

553
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,800
the enemies in it, for the most part, I think.

554
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,200
Probably.

555
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,600
Well, it's very hard to say, right.

556
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,500
The real question is how we want to held your doorman entities.

557
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,200
But let's say that every entities always simulated for now.

558
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,200
We'll put this question aside temporarily, but let's say that every

559
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,800
editing we wanted every enemy in the game to always be active.

560
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,300
That's just something we're going to do in the game.

561
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Every entity has a behavior of any and every NDS stuff that happens to

562
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,700
them and they're always kind of possible to be used.

563
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,700
If that was the case.

564
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,600
Then I know that basically my low frequency table, always has all the

565
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,400
entities in it.

566
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,500
So what I could do for my addressing is basically just address into

567
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,200
the low frequency table, always.

568
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
And then if there's a high frequency, if that person is actually in

569
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,900
the high frequency table, I just store something at the head of that,

570
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
that sort of says, like, oh, you know, he's in the high frequency

571
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,500
table and here's where he is, right?

572
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,800
Let's say I could do something like that.

573
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,200
The other thing I could do is have a separate table.

574
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
That's totally transient and isn't stored that just says, who's in

575
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600
high frequency, and who's in low frequency, right?

576
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,700
So, you always look, there's always a 72,000 72,000 entry table, right

577
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,300
out here that has all the entities in it, and basically, all it is, is

578
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,300
just a pointer or just, you know, like a information that says,

579
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,600
whether it's in high frequency electricity table and where it is,

580
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,400
right?

581
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
And then, every time someone moves from one to the other, we update

582
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,100
this.

583
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,000
So, there's different ways that I could do that the

584
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
This is doing it this way and maybe this is the right way.

585
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,400
Is that we can also have dormant entities, which is to say that

586
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,300
entities, that are in here.

587
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,400
They're in neither table, right?

588
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,700
It's like, it would energy just doesn't even exist anymore.

589
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,600
Maybe it's in some like dormant table, which literally just stores

590
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,600
where it was.

591
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,100
So, the only thing that's in there is the location so that when it

592
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,300
moves in range, it can move, it can move from this table, into this

593
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,300
table, into the high frequency table, but it, like, never actually has

594
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,000
to have its, you know, be processed in the low frequency table, right?

595
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,800
So, I don't know.

596
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
That's a good question.

597
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,200
But the fact that I'm even thinking about it suggests to me that

598
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,400
probably, we would want to start with a three table scheme.

599
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,400
So that we know that, we could support doorman entities correctly.

600
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,700
And then if we find that it's not necessary, we could collapse down to

601
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,800
the, to the, to table scheme, but basically, like what I'm trying to

602
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,000
say here is I'm a little worried that baking it into this.

603
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,200
Table is a bit of a premature optimization and I'll be sorry later

604
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,900
that I did that because I want it to be more flexible in various ways

605
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,100
or whatever, right?

606
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,800
So

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
That's what I'm thinking right now.

608
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
That's roughly the way I'm thinking about it.

609
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,800
And so, this high frequency table would store everyone in float space.

610
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,700
It would be float.

611
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,500
Space, based around wherever the camera is at the moment.

612
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,100
And whenever the camera moved, we just update all the entities in here

613
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,500
to have that offset, probably or something like that.

614
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm not sure exactly how we want to do that.

615
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll have to think about that later, but this would basically always

616
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,600
be float space and these would always be in tile space.

617
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Right?

618
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,300
And that would get us completely out of the business of having those

619
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,000
sort of annoying two-tiered coordinate systems because we still have

620
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
the court system that we worked out and it would still be working

621
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,500
correctly, but we would no longer have to worry about dealing with

622
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,700
them.

623
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,800
Both at the same time.

624
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,000
We'd always only deal with one in low frequency and only in float in

625
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
the other and they're just be one very clearly defined place where we

626
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
do that transition.

627
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,500
And that, you know, I think what's would make it first of all, very

628
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,800
bug-free, right?

629
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,300
Because I feel like we've already had bugs that involved, having to

630
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,400
deal with with those two at the same time because the canonicalization

631
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
and all that junk.

632
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,100
And, and so just being entirely in float, over here, would be great

633
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
and I think it would eliminate a huge source of bugs.

634
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,400
It would also eliminate a huge source of frustration of having to deal

635
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,600
with these Special coordinate systems and all that sort of stuff.

636
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
Because we would know that we would just always be in tiles here,

637
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
which are just integer Thailand disease, and we'd always be of float

638
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
over here and never the tricks chummy, right?

639
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,900
So that seems pretty good to me.

640
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,200
I feel like that's pretty reasonable.

641
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,900
And so I feel like that's probably what I would start with.

642
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,500
And then I'll have to think about, you know, what, these tables look

643
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:02,700
like.

644
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,500
We'll have to evolve as we decide what we want to do for any system.

645
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,600
But this seems like a little bit of a better approach to me.

646
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,500
And so similarly over in the high frequency side of things, not

647
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,900
necessarily in the entity table, but in addition to the end of the

648
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,600
table, I feel like it would also be all of the sort of stuff in the

649
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
In that area as well, right?

650
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,300
So all of the, you know, basically everything that we are doing, for

651
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,100
the game would kind of be in here.

652
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
That's in that sort of apron, would be in here.

653
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,200
Like where all the trees are, where the shop is, where the grasses

654
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,900
are, all that sort of stuff would all kind of be this thing in that

655
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,400
apron.

656
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,800
And then when we sort of go and and it gets sort of moved out, we just

657
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,800
yeah, we just say that's the end of it.

658
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,500
Okay.

659
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,400
So really, the only thing that I'm not still sure about exactly how I

660
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,900
want to do is sort of the I'm not really sure how I was.

661
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,300
To handle the the re offsetting part of things, right?

662
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,300
So there's there's a way we could cheese it, but I'm not really

663
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,400
interested in cheesing it.

664
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,300
So I want to talk about it a little bit.

665
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,400
So let's suppose right.

666
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,000
Let's suppose that I'm looking at this screen here and the hot region

667
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,300
that's being.

668
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,200
Simulated is like one screen around me on all sides.

669
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,300
Right?

670
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,900
And I don't know if diagonals are in there as well.

671
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,900
But you know something like this so you figured there are nine

672
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,700
screens.

673
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,100
Like I said, potentially 27,

674
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Means if we wanted to think about vertical as well, I don't know if we

675
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,900
do or not.

676
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,100
But basically there's some number of screens that are in the hot set

677
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,500
here and everything outside of here.

678
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:46,900
Right?

679
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,300
All this is the Wasteland that's all in the low frequency table.

680
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,400
So when something comes from the low frequency table into the high

681
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,100
frequency table, right?

682
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,900
It's simple enough.

683
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,000
We just say, where is the camera looking right?

684
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,300
This?

685
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,100
You know, let's say we just moved here.

686
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,400
So this this tile, you know, we

687
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:05,800
Moved.

688
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,400
We just move one to the right, you know, we did that motion.

689
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,700
And so now these guys are coming into that hot set.

690
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
They were previously dormant.

691
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,600
So we gather all the things that are in here, right?

692
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,100
And we go ahead and we say, where are they relative to that camera

693
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
location, you know?

694
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,900
And we place them right?

695
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,000
So now we've got all of the things that are there and they're in float

696
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,400
space, right?

697
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,200
So what we've created, you know, is a local coordinate system where we

698
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,700
can do everything.

699
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,100
And we know that we have plenty of flow Precision because it's a very

700
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,900
tiny little world.

701
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,100
So it doesn't matter how giant our actual world is the real world that

702
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,500
we're simulating.

703
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,300
Willow.

704
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,700
I will if anything be smaller than most games full coordinate system.

705
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,200
So we'll have you in more Precision than most games have, right?

706
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Because we're in this tiny space.

707
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,300
And so, you know, that all works out great.

708
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,500
And it allows us to have his giant to world, as we want, and never

709
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
have to worry about float, precision and still do everything in float.

710
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,000
So that we don't have

711
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Many performance penalty either, which is all nice, but we do have one

712
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
performance problem.

713
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,700
Well, it's not a very important problem, but one performance concern.

714
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,800
The problem is what happens when we move again.

715
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,400
So when the guy moves here, right?

716
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,800
So this is now the new center.

717
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,500
Well, what do we do with all of these guys, right, all of their

718
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
floating Point positions.

719
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,200
If we were always going to make them be centered around the camera,

720
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,800
right?

721
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,400
They all have to be updated.

722
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,000
So, basically, everything in the high frequency table, essentially has

723
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,800
to be updated when we, when we do that move.

724
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
And so I don't know.

725
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,600
I mean, is that a problem?

726
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Is that not a problem?

727
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,800
I mean, how many entities in here?

728
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,200
We have to have for that move to be an issue.

729
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,700
I don't know, you know if there was a thousand guys we're talking

730
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,900
about basically an ad, we're talking about, you know, a CMD ad where

731
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,300
you've got, you know, an x, a y and a z coordinate or something and

732
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,800
we're just full on adding and

733
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,900
XYZ, so we're talking about like one Cindy up, but we got to kind of

734
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,700
go through it all, you know, for all the guys or whatever.

735
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,000
And so, you know, if we have to offset a thousand of them, when we

736
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
move is that a big deal, right?

737
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
And I don't think it is.

738
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:16,100
I think we can basically do that in a very trivial number of Cycles.

739
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,600
You know, what, if we push that, how high would that have to be before

740
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,000
we care?

741
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,900
I don't think that much.

742
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm just worried about like let's say each individual tree, you know,

743
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,700
in this world is being done, that way, you know, something like that.

744
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,800
Yeah, so I don't know.

745
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,700
It's something to think about is the point.

746
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,800
And so I'm not sure about that part.

747
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,600
But what it does suggest to me as well, is that that high frequency

748
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,700
table might want to be stored in a way where you kind of have some

749
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,700
sort of a notion of the X Y, the X has the wise and the Z coordinates

750
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,100
that are stored in a way that's very efficient to bulk process, for

751
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
addition, because that may be one of the biggest operations we do is

752
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,800
we move left to right or with that sort of thing.

753
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,600
But anyway, something to think about.

754
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,100
So,

755
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,900
About it.

756
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,100
I think that's that's really the only sort of snafu of the plan in my

757
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,100
mind where things are not 100% obvious that they're good.

758
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,900
That part is a little wonky, right?

759
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,199
That's yeah, so that's a little bit wonky.

760
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,600
And there's a couple other things that are not super clear about this,

761
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,100
right?

762
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,600
I'm not sure how we deal with the fact that like, so there's there's

763
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,900
dormant entities or not dormant, but low frequency of these out here.

764
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,100
So there's a question of how

765
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,699
how people ask about how low frequency and high frequency, entities,

766
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:39,100
see each other, you know, maybe they don't really but I mean, let's

767
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:39,699
pick.

768
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,500
Absolutely ridiculous example, like say that there's the concept that

769
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
whether I can see this.

770
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,100
There's here the sky or not and he made a sound and this guy knows

771
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,199
about it, but they're in different spaces, right?

772
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:59,000
So, you know, is there something that basically allows us to easily

773
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,900
Push simulation stuff out and in from the two different kinds of

774
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,000
people who are being simulated here, right?

775
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:06,800
And I don't know.

776
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,200
So that's that's just something again to think about.

777
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't really know how we're going to deal with with that stuff too

778
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,000
much.

779
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,800
It's a little bit tricky for the stuff that's on the main screen.

780
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,900
Doesn't seem that much of a problem because unlikely that people will

781
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,400
be thinking about guys that are multiple screens away in terms of what

782
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
they're doing, exactly.

783
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,100
So I think that we're probably safe for all of the gameplay.

784
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,500
Interactions.

785
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,600
That actually happened but it's what happened to that apron.

786
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,300
That's a little bit confusing.

787
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
So again, we'll have to cross that bridge.

788
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,500
When we come to it.

789
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,400
We certainly haven't gotten to the point now where I have enough

790
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,700
information to really know what I would do there.

791
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:38,900
So there you go.

792
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,700
That's my full.

793
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,800
That's my full brain dump on.

794
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,200
Like, how I'm thinking about this stuff.

795
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,100
If that makes sense.

796
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,400
But if we kind of look at what we've got already, it's not like

797
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,300
there's all that much work to do to sort of get us there or at least

798
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,900
to sort of get us started on what's going to happen there.

799
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,000
So here's our

800
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,600
are you know our way that we're drawing entities, right.

801
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,300
And based on what we're doing now is we're constantly Computing that

802
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,800
difference.

803
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,200
From the camera.

804
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,600
So we're constantly saying, where is this relative to the camera?

805
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,100
And so, really, all I'm saying is that, now what we would do instead

806
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,100
of that, is we'd say, okay, let's actually go ahead and always just

807
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,200
store the entities relative the camera if they're in that set or not,

808
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,700
right?

809
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,000
So I what I want to do is kind of bifurcate these here.

810
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,300
I want to say that I've got, you know, maybe we'll call it a high

811
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,200
entity or at HF entity, or an LF entity.

812
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
I don't know, something like that.

813
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,800
I'm not really sure what I would call these exactly, but

814
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
But, you know, High entity and low entity am not sure if there really

815
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,000
isn't a particularly good naming for the my guest.

816
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,300
But if you imagine, we've got these right then my low-frequency

817
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,600
entities and my high frequency entities, my high frequency entities

818
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
would only just have a V2 for their position.

819
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,800
Right?

820
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,100
And I guess we still, we haven't really talked about what we're going

821
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,000
to do about Z.

822
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,700
I don't know if we want to kind of make this start to be a

823
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,300
three-dimensional Vector there.

824
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,900
We kind of got a thing.

825
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,200
About exactly how we're going to deal with three dimensional.

826
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,800
But for now, if we're only talking about two Dimensions, we've

827
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,400
essentially got this, where we've got the same stuff we had before

828
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,900
with the width height, 50 Direction, and all that sort of stuff.

829
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,600
And then we've got the low frequency entities, which basically store

830
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,900
the the tile map position stuff, right?

831
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,600
They're the ones who actually store this time at position data.

832
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,600
And we could start to eliminate that by saying.

833
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
We don't care about the offset any more after it goes off screen.

834
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,600
I'm not sure.

835
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
We'll see how that goes.

836
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,300
But anyway, so if we've got this, there's another part of, there's

837
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,100
nothing we could think about as well, which is whether we want to keep

838
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,400
the low frequency and of these around.

839
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,700
So the high-frequency entity can basically reference stuff in the low

840
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,300
frequency entity and that would be an interesting idea as well.

841
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,000
So let's say we also have the dormant entity, right?

842
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,400
See here.

843
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,300
I'm going to go ahead and call this low entity and high entity.

844
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,700
So if we had the doorman entity as well, like dormant entity would

845
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,100
definitely store the position right?

846
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,500
Because that's the thing that it needs to know and then the low

847
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,000
entity.

848
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,300
I don't know exactly what that would store or whether it would store

849
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,000
anything in addition to that necessarily.

850
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,200
But it might be depending on, you know, what sort of any of these you

851
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,100
had what kind of data it wants to remember.

852
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,500
And then you'd have the high energy which has more stuff yet.

853
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,800
And so the question is, you know, are these actually sort of do?

854
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,700
You actually always have all three for an entity?

855
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,800
That's in the high end of the space?

856
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,300
And always have both for the low entities.

857
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,700
And then sometimes only once the door - so like do these actually form

858
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:31,800
sort of a composite piece so that, for example, if the width and

859
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,500
height of an entity is something that actually needs to be specified,

860
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,300
then that's actually out in the dormant entity because it's something

861
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,400
that you actually always need to persist.

862
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,100
Whereas something like the facing direction is not.

863
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,800
So it's only in the high entity for example, right?

864
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,000
So you can see where I'm kind of thinking this through.

865
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
I don't really know yet.

866
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,600
And so this is a case where I'm going to write the usage code first,

867
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,700
like I always say, we'll find out.

868
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,900
But again, I'm just trying to write something here so I can start.

869
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,700
So that's an example.

870
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,700
You know, that's let's say we're doing something like that.

871
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:00,500
All right.

872
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,100
So at first, excuse me, at first to keep things simple, let's actually

873
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,800
just have three tables that all have the same, so we'll have high

874
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,000
entities and we'll just do the exact same number for each of them for

875
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,300
now.

876
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,400
So low entity, right?

877
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
And then doormanity.

878
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,900
Okay, and like I said, don't really know what's going to happen here,

879
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,200
so we're just kind of playing around.

880
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,200
So if we do that, then we can sort of say, alright?

881
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,100
So just High into these are the only entities that we actually want

882
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,300
and so all we really need to know is whether or not an entity exists

883
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,600
in that in that high into table, so again just doing the dumbest

884
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,000
possible thing will just store something here, just sort of a Flags

885
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,600
field or something which is just like entity some kind of and I don't

886
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
know entity and

887
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,500
The Residency or something like that, right?

888
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,600
So there we go.

889
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,600
And we'll say that our entity residency is just going to say,

890
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,800
basically, which of those tables, The Entity is in, at the moment.

891
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,100
So we basically have a entity residents.

892
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,900
Hi, you know, low or dormant, right?

893
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:16,500
Really?

894
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,100
Really simple.

895
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,900
So entity residents and I guess, since I'm not packing, everything

896
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,600
else in there.

897
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
I can literally just say

898
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
Say that we've got that.

899
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,000
So if we got the entity residents, that would tell us which one it's

900
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,400
in.

901
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,100
And so again the really inefficient way of doing this is we'll just

902
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,000
Loop over them all.

903
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,300
And actually do it and then we'll try to start splitting it out into a

904
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,900
slightly more efficient version and see kind of how that plays out, if

905
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,600
that makes sense.

906
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,900
So off we go.

907
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,900
We Loop over our entities here and obviously

908
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,300
When we, when we get this, we can sort of see what is the actual

909
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,200
residence of a particular entity.

910
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,600
Right?

911
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,800
So here's my other the index.

912
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,300
Here's its residents and we can just say for right now.

913
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,100
We're only going to deal with the high entities for the moment because

914
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,600
that's the only thing we actually know how to do.

915
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,900
We don't actually have any definitions for low or you know, what they

916
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,000
would be doing out there, but we'll have to sort of figure that out.

917
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,700
As we go.

918
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,800
So, here we go.

919
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,800
And I guess we have that exists thing, but I feel like now that we

920
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,100
have entity residents exists, won't necessarily be a something we need

921
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:26,200
because we could just have, like, you know, non-existent or something,

922
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,500
right?

923
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,200
We can just have some some and we could, we could reorganize this.

924
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,600
So basically you like don't exist your dormant, your lower, your high,

925
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,000
right?

926
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,900
And we can, so we can sort of move that concept of existence sort of

927
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,500
up into the actual.

928
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Entity residents instead of having a separate Boolean for it, which

929
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,100
isn't really necessary.

930
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,900
So, assuming that it is in the residents, high table, then we can say,

931
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,300
okay.

932
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,800
Well then if it is, we want to get the high entity out of it and let's

933
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,700
go ahead and grab that.

934
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,200
So we've got our high-end fees.

935
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,100
So that's in game State.

936
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,800
I entities and we will grab it.

937
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,800
At the index.

938
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
There we go, like so so that will basically give us what we needed to

939
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,600
know, for that.

940
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,800
And now we're saying that basically the pee in here is exactly what we

941
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,600
actually wanted directly, right?

942
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,800
I'm out of tea, man.

943
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:25,400
II brought two tea cups and I'm out completely.

944
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,700
It's like how does that even happen?

945
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,800
Right?

946
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,500
Got it Morty.

947
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,700
All right, Jeeves.

948
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,800
Touch the ti need those little bells that they have in fancy British

949
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,000
documentaries.

950
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,200
All right, so if I have a high entity, what I need to do is I need to

951
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,100
grab out.

952
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,000
It's, it's information about where it is.

953
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,100
And what I'm saying is that now this is already relative to the

954
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,400
camera, right?

955
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,700
So this is already relative to the camera.

956
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,000
Or it is.

957
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,000
So all I have to do is draw it relative to the camera.

958
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,700
Now, which means I go ahead and say and and one interesting thing.

959
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,400
That's to think about there as if we did want to do the split screen

960
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:10,600
thing.

961
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,400
We'd have to do something a little fancier here because it's like

962
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,000
well, Rich camera, right?

963
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,100
So we need to have at that point.

964
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,100
You would need to have some note in the residents when you said it was

965
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,500
resident in high, you had to say which camera belong to there'd.

966
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,400
Be some kind of fussiness there, right?

967
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,300
So, that'd be a little more complicated.

968
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't know if we want to deal.

969
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,900
That because I don't think the split screens are very good idea, but

970
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,900
something to put in the back of your head, if it comes down to it, we

971
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,800
will have to do more work there.

972
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,100
So, anyway, we'll get the high entity out.

973
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,900
And now we just need to say, all right.

974
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,400
All we need to do now is just take a look at that, that high into DP

975
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,700
and that gives us exactly what we, what we actually want.

976
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,300
There we go, X and I think we also need the low or try the dormant

977
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,000
entity portion to get the

978
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,700
width and the height out, right?

979
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:03,700
Yeah.

980
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,700
And so again, don't worry too much about what we're doing here.

981
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,900
I'm just playing around with it.

982
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,300
Obviously, there's a bunch of things that are kind of a little messy.

983
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,500
Like, it's like, okay, we have to do two different gathers of memory

984
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,200
to get it, which is not necessarily a bad idea because probably

985
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
there's enough that it would be two different cache lines anyway, so

986
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
it's not really necessarily big deal.

987
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
But again, don't think too hard about it yet.

988
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,000
I just want to see what we have to do.

989
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,700
And then we'll start worrying about massaging.

990
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,000
This sort of thing to make sure that we're not setting up a

991
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,200
performance trap for ourselves.

992
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,700
Later.

993
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,100
We have to optimize this stuff, but for now, don't worry too much

994
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,100
about that because it's not, it's not our primary focus.

995
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,600
Our primary focus right now is to see how we would structure this at

996
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,900
all at the start.

997
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,800
So yeah, so if we're going to fetch all of them, let's say right, then

998
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,900
it would look like this, right.

999
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,600
This is, this is how we would fetch all of them.

1000
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,800
So, let's assume we fetch all of them.

1001
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,500
It's the doorman entity that has the width, right?

1002
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,200
And then we've got sort of anything else.

1003
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,100
Do we have anything else on here?

1004
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,800
I don't even know what.

1005
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,100
Got, let's see, right.

1006
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,300
Okay.

1007
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,700
So this, this entity stuff.

1008
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,100
Now, we actually have to deal with also, because when you put things

1009
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,600
in like the get entity stuff, obviously that has to has to know who

1010
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,700
it's fetching, whether it's fetching high in, these are low, 80's, or

1011
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,200
so on.

1012
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,700
In this case.

1013
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:26,400
I feel like what we, what we want is get entity, right?

1014
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,500
We want to.

1015
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,400
This is really get high entity.

1016
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,100
Is what it always is essentially, right?

1017
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,900
Oh.

1018
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,600
Oh, I'm I'm sensing a.

1019
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,400
I'm sensing a fun necklace.

1020
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
I'm sensing a fun thing.

1021
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,200
Okay.

1022
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,200
Yeah, I'm liking where this is going.

1023
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,700
All right, I'm liking this a lot.

1024
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,000
Dude.

1025
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Are you with me on this?

1026
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,700
I don't know if you guys are with me on this.

1027
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,500
Do you does.

1028
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,100
Everyone already know what I'm about to do?

1029
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,800
I think you already all do so, it's fine, but I kind of got excited

1030
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,400
about it there.

1031
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,500
So what I just realized,

1032
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:13,200
Is actually, if I basically say that these are flags, right?

1033
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:22,000
Like so then what you could say was just okay.

1034
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,300
When I call get entity.

1035
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,500
It returns me an entity.

1036
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,000
And when I asked for that entity, I can just say, why don't I tell you

1037
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,900
right?

1038
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,600
What state I wanted the entity in.

1039
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,700
So like I want, you know, the state of the entity I can say which

1040
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,400
state it is.

1041
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,800
And then when it goes to get it, it can move it into the state that it

1042
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,100
needs to be and if it wasn't already in that state, right?

1043
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:56,700
So when I call get entity, right, all I have to do is say, okay, when

1044
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,000
you call get entity, you tell me what state you wanted, this guy to be

1045
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,500
in.

1046
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,100
I don't know that.

1047
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,700
I maybe I don't actually need those to be flagged because they're I

1048
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,600
guess there always

1049
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,800
Are always kind of never mind.

1050
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,600
I didn't actually need them to be flagged.

1051
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
That's not true because they're always strictly in order.

1052
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,200
So I guess I can still just say, right.

1053
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,700
Something like this residence.

1054
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,800
So like that.

1055
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,300
Okay, so yes, but still everything else still applies.

1056
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
I can just say, I wanted it at this level of residents and when this

1057
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
guy goes to get it, if it's not at that level of residents, you can

1058
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,500
just move it in.

1059
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,700
So that way when we do get entity, right, let's go ahead and do this

1060
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,100
here.

1061
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,100
What's going on?

1062
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:38,700
There we go.

1063
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,300
You switched on me switch back.

1064
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:41,900
There we go.

1065
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,000
Try it again.

1066
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,200
Okay, I like it to have it on the right side for some reason which is

1067
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,700
bad.

1068
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,800
I guess when I guess because it's the the it's closer to my center

1069
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,400
line of view.

1070
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,100
It really means.

1071
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,400
I should move this over here and the mini buffer over here, but it's

1072
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,400
like, yeah, you know, it's all complicated anyway, so if I'm going to

1073
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,900
go ahead,

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And do all this.

1075
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,700
Now I have to actually do the porting work to make that happen.

1076
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,200
So I have an entity.

1077
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,200
I'm going to return that entity structure.

1078
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,500
We will then go ahead and give it all of the different portions of

1079
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,100
that.

1080
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:23,900
So, entity residents equals residents and we will say, dormant

1081
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
entities, right?

1082
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,400
Lo.

1083
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,900
Hi, there we go with that, and that's it.

1084
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,400
There we go.

1085
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,400
And then I have to say that it's got to be less than the entity count,

1086
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,200
right?

1087
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,000
You count.

1088
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,500
Do I ever try to get an entity?

1089
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,100
Who hasn't actually been Inked yet?

1090
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:51,800
No, I don't.

1091
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,400
So we're good.

1092
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:53,800
All right.

1093
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,800
So then we're calling get entity here again, which residents so

1094
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,600
players will always be in the highwomen.

1095
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,700
Because they're always on screen or important.

1096
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,200
So that's just a given that their goal is going to be high and that's

1097
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:05,700
fine.

1098
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,300
So we don't have to set their existence anymore because that's already

1099
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,900
handled and now we have this.

1100
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,300
So we've got load up P.

1101
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,700
So

1102
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,700
Right?

1103
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,200
And then we've got oh wait.

1104
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:20,900
No, that's dormant.

1105
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,200
Sorry dormant .p.

1106
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,600
Okay, so that's in the dormant, set their doormat.

1107
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,400
I like that.

1108
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,200
So that's in the doorman set and then there's

1109
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,600
This is also in there set, we go.

1110
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,400
And so now the only question is.

1111
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,100
When I actually do that sort of.

1112
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,600
Initialization, I guess I want to be able to kind of move him up into

1113
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,200
that.

1114
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,000
I want to map them into the camera space after I set up that that

1115
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,800
whole situation.

1116
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Mmm.

1117
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,200
This is going to be interesting because you see why this is a little

1118
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,200
bit complicated.

1119
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,400
Once we initialize a player.

1120
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,000
I guess, it needs to be wherever the camera was and then that'll be

1121
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,300
okay.

1122
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,600
And then only be once you move.

1123
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,400
So that's yeah, that's actually totally fine.

1124
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
All right, never mind.

1125
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:17,900
I thought there.

1126
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,200
A little bit of an issue there.

1127
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,000
So this we're going to have to think about a little bit harder exactly

1128
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,700
how we want to do that.

1129
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,500
I'm going to go through some more of these and oh, yeah, right.

1130
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,300
This is a DOT.

1131
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,600
I've messed up my dots in my arrows.

1132
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,200
I'd never really no one really knows why see decided, but it was a

1133
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,500
good idea to have both of those.

1134
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,400
It seems like you always just want that.

1135
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,000
I don't know why they did Arrow.

1136
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,900
It was a very odd decision.

1137
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,800
It doesn't seem sensible.

1138
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,200
Anyway, get entity.

1139
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,900
So okay in this one.

1140
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,000
We're also going to see whether or not there actually was an entity

1141
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,000
that the camera was already following and I guess we don't care which

1142
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,400
residents that was so it could be dormant for All We Care.

1143
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Actually matter, but we just want to see whether or not it actually

1144
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,700
existed.

1145
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:15,500
So we just want to say if entity dot residents equals non-existent,

1146
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,400
right?

1147
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,600
So if it's not existent than we want to start following the first

1148
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,100
player, I guess, is what we decided to do.

1149
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,300
So, that's fine.

1150
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,400
So what we need to do now is we need to map this guy, properly into

1151
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:27,900
that space.

1152
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,900
So really, in some sense that's

1153
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,600
That's this.

1154
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:38,000
And then after we actually initialize it, we could say, map entity or

1155
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,300
set entity residence or something like this right change entity

1156
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,700
residents, might be a good name for it, where I basically just passed

1157
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,700
that entity and it will go ahead and change it to something that it

1158
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,200
isn't already.

1159
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,800
So it'll map it from that dormant too high and that will do the

1160
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,100
mapping to where the camera, actually, is, right?

1161
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,300
So that seems fine.

1162
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,700
Let's see.

1163
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,500
Identity doesn't really have to do anything other than clear out all

1164
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:12,800
of the state, right?

1165
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,500
That was really all, we said that Adam Stephen did was add into T.

1166
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,700
Just clears everybody.

1167
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,100
So really, we could just say, okay?

1168
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,100
If you're going to add an entity, you can you can basically add the

1169
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,100
entity as a dormant entity.

1170
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,900
So that's just going to be dormant.

1171
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:38,000
These entity index equals nothing low entities and high empties, right

1172
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,500
equals.

1173
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,700
Nothing like so and then we paste it just set that table.

1174
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,700
Our resident stable entity residents, that's going to be equal to.

1175
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,700
Oops, that's going to be equal to dormant.

1176
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,200
I guess that's how everything gets added probably, right?

1177
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,200
And you're done.

1178
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:05,600
So that seems reasonable that totally seems fine so far.

1179
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,200
I don't know that we care about any of the rest of this.

1180
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,300
Let's see, change.

1181
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,600
Yes, we haven't written that yet.

1182
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,700
And that's fine.

1183
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,500
We want to assert that.

1184
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,100
Basically, we are not out of the array range of any of these.

1185
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:23,900
That up.

1186
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:30,000
So it's not underneath my head, change into your residence DP K.

1187
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,500
So this will basically just do.

1188
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,300
Yeah, it's still going to do what we had before with this.

1189
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,400
This could probably pass by value.

1190
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Maybe it's quite a few pointers.

1191
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,700
I don't know how you want to do that.

1192
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,600
But probably we do something like this, right?

1193
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,100
So we'd say that entity.

1194
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,800
Hi.

1195
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,200
So everywhere, we did entity Arrow would now be like probably entity.

1196
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,500
Hi.

1197
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:57,100
Arrow like so and so on.

1198
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,800
Yeah, of course.

1199
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
None of this.

1200
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,500
Yeah, none of this is actually really necessary anymore.

1201
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,300
Right?

1202
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,700
Because, well, first of all, this stuff can just go away.

1203
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,000
We don't need any of that anymore because we're not doing things that

1204
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,700
way anymore.

1205
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,800
And now we also really don't have to do this stuff anymore.

1206
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,400
Either.

1207
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,600
This is going to be interesting change.

1208
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,200
This is going to take a while because we can get rid of a lot of cruft

1209
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,500
here.

1210
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,100
This will probably have to be a

1211
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,200
loop through to tomorrow kind of a change because there's there's a

1212
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,000
another easily another whole hours worth of work in here with all the

1213
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,200
stuff.

1214
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,700
We can change this.

1215
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,500
We don't the Collision detector doesn't have to actually do any of

1216
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,200
this stuff with the tiles anymore, either because that stuff will get

1217
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,100
mapped in to the working set.

1218
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,700
Basically.

1219
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:50,700
Yeah, so I'm going to go ahead and, and get rid of this stuff entirely

1220
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,400
for the moment.

1221
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:57,500
So that will just basically be old player P.

1222
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,400
Hi P there.

1223
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:58,900
Go.

1224
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,600
We don't need that at all.

1225
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,200
This will just.

1226
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:08,200
So this will just literally be the entity High p is the old player P

1227
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,900
and then the DPS and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1228
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Yes, everything is.

1229
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,700
So I'm just, I'm just eliminating, the tile map position stuff

1230
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:21,900
basically and so the new player P, all that's going to be, is the old

1231
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,300
player P.

1232
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,800
Plus the player, Delta 0 and we're down to the Q&A.

1233
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,200
No.

1234
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh man.

1235
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,600
I was just getting started to well, you know, how it is.

1236
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,100
You know how it is.

1237
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:38,700
Sometimes.

1238
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,700
You, you run out of time.

1239
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,300
You just you run out of time when you're trying to program.

1240
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,700
So let's go ahead and sort of clean things up just a little bit.

1241
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
So we've got change entity residents here.

1242
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,200
Right?

1243
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,400
Which is going to take that game State and it's going to take an empty

1244
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,200
to change D.

1245
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,000
And I guess really that's just going to take a an entity index because

1246
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,400
that, that one's well, yeah.

1247
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,600
So that's like an empty there.

1248
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,700
Yes, we'll change it to the residents.

1249
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,000
That will go ahead and do that.

1250
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:32,000
And now I just need to see which actually wants to do implement this.

1251
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,400
There we go.

1252
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,200
And

1253
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,800
clean up some of these last little things here.

1254
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:46,100
I would like to get it compiling before we stop if possible, because

1255
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,100
that's usually nice.

1256
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,100
So this has to be a high entity obviously.

1257
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,200
Basically only thing we were working with before where entities that

1258
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,500
were would have been high.

1259
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,800
We didn't have any doorman entities at all, right?

1260
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,500
What's this asking about cannot convert?

1261
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,000
Right, put that in the right place.

1262
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,400
Glad to again.

1263
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,800
See type checking, so good, catch us so many errors, and that will be

1264
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,200
like that if the residents equals

1265
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
not equals assistant.

1266
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,000
There we go.

1267
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,900
Then I think that's all correct.

1268
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,000
Well looks good camera.

1269
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,100
Following entity gets gotten this way.

1270
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,600
And I guess we don't really care about which one it is, but it should

1271
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,200
be high.

1272
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,500
I guess we do care because it should always be high at the cameras,

1273
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,100
following it.

1274
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:45,700
So, if residents equals non-existence, I want to make an actual check

1275
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,100
for that.

1276
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
I feel like there should just be if exists.

1277
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,600
Basically, that seems like a thing that's coming up pretty often.

1278
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,400
Let's see, does not have an overloaded member operator.

1279
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,000
That's true.

1280
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,800
It doesn't.

1281
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,300
So that's just a high p.

1282
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,300
And the Abbe style Z 0.

1283
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:05,500
Right.

1284
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,700
So that's actually dormant the, and this is also a dormant P.

1285
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,700
But let's see.

1286
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,500
So really this, you know what?

1287
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
I'm going to if this zero out as well because this can all be done

1288
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,800
differently to because now this will all be in the right space to do

1289
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,400
fix this to work in camera space.

1290
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,300
We won't have to work with tiles there, either.

1291
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:26,600
Yeah.

1292
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,200
This is going to be a nice change.

1293
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,900
I think this is what I want had been wanting to do, but

1294
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,000
I said you kind of got to go in waves that you know that you're not

1295
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,500
doing things.

1296
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,500
Totally dumb, dumb lie.

1297
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,500
Let's see here.

1298
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,100
So entity residents, that's this.

1299
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,700
Torment entity.

1300
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,400
Let's see here.

1301
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:52,100
Dormant into the width and height dormant of T is not 0 because I

1302
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,100
spelled it wrong.

1303
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,300
Doormat entity.

1304
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
Well, if we ever have a doormat entity that would be an appropriate

1305
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,100
name for it.

1306
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,500
Right?

1307
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,100
We could have a doormat, something that the player steps on when they

1308
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,100
go, you know to house or something like that.

1309
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,700
Okay, and let's see.

1310
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,900
So that's going to be high in to be facing Direction.

1311
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,800
Okay, so that's not going to now.

1312
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,100
We've totally regressed.

1313
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,600
Our game is totally busted at this point.

1314
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,100
So, you know, what can we do?

1315
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,500
That's just the way it goes, but at least we're running and that's

1316
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:21,900
fine.

1317
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,800
So tomorrow we will go through.

1318
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,200
Finish this entire sweep, and I think our code will be in a much

1319
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,900
better place there.

1320
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,600
It'll be really much simpler to work with now that we've finally done

1321
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,100
the change.

1322
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,600
That sort of.

1323
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,900
I've been saying we should do for a while, but never quite got around

1324
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,400
to doing.

1325
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So let's go ahead and start the Q&A.

1326
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,500
Since we're a little bit over time.

1327
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,200
Not too much though only about three minutes.

1328
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,200
So that's good.

1329
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:53,200
So, please, if you could prefix your colons with your colons prefix,

1330
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:53,700
your question.

1331
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:58,800
Ins or your colons prefix, your questions with Q: so I can see them.

1332
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,900
And if you could

1333
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But two things that we've done in today's streamer on previous

1334
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,300
streams.

1335
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,800
If you have questions that are off topic, save those for free stream,

1336
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,900
which just come 15 minutes before the stream starts on any given day.

1337
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,400
And I'm here answering all kinds of wacky questions.

1338
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:21,000
How about hot cold and Frozen instead of hi-low dormant?

1339
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,200
I don't think Kyle.

1340
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,700
Oh, and dormant is great when they're high frequency, low frequency.

1341
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,000
And dormant is pretty good.

1342
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,200
I think and hot cold, Frozen is if anything worse, I would say.

1343
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,700
But that's not to say that I think high-low doorman is great, but I'm

1344
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,500
not, I'm not in love with hot cold Frozen.

1345
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,300
Are We spelled non-existent incorrectly.

1346
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,300
Is that true?

1347
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,600
You're right, we did well, you know.

1348
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,000
I feel like the key there is, is that

1349
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,100
Really you want to make sure that whatever it is.

1350
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,900
It can be assigned to a variable.

1351
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,100
If there is a variable in, you know, if a variable should ever exist

1352
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,900
and stop being non-existent.

1353
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,400
It would be important to say the least.

1354
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,600
Ah, yes, Tarzan, Charizard's reminded me of something that I asked

1355
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,400
specifically on the forums for someone to remind me to do and he

1356
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,200
reminded me, whereas its own intrinsics.

1357
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,900
So, one of the things that I've been doing periodically, just, we have

1358
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:33,100
imported our code yet to another platform, but other people have, and

1359
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,200
I try to make life a little easier for them when we can.

1360
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:41,600
And so what I wanted to do was go ahead and wrap the the

1361
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,000
Which these do not exist on other compilers, I guess sometimes,

1362
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,100
depending on the platform.

1363
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:52,500
I wanted to go ahead and wrap the rotates instructions because, like

1364
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,400
these other instructions are pretty standard C runtime, Library

1365
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:55,800
instruction.

1366
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,300
So other people who are pointing to other platforms will have access

1367
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:02,700
to these typically but they won't have say the b can forward on that

1368
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,500
we put in here.

1369
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,900
And so what I want to do was I'd forgot the done that for the raw and

1370
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,400
people were having trouble compiling on.

1371
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,200
Other platforms.

1372
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,500
I just wanted to go ahead and do that in here.

1373
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:11,600
So

1374
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,300
So we don't care what this is at the moment because basically, you

1375
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:18,100
want to actually compile this out to a tour, rotate certainly.

1376
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,500
So we'll sort of do a to do Casey.

1377
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:27,000
Find out actually Port this to other compiler platforms.

1378
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,100
So, that we actually do get a rotate since anything with x64 should

1379
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,500
give us a rotate, right?

1380
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,100
That should be there.

1381
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,500
I don't know if arm has it or not, but basically anything x64 should

1382
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:38,900
have it so we want to actually go find out what it actually is, but

1383
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,600
basically all we have to do now is say well, okay, you know, if the

1384
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,200
Mount.

1385
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,900
There's there's a couple of weird ways you can do this.

1386
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,300
I think you can do like a dual shift that an or kind of a thing, but

1387
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,800
I'm just going to do it the straightforward way and we'll see if the

1388
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,100
compiler generates hopefully during something smart.

1389
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,500
But basically, if the amount is zero, then we'll do.

1390
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:59,800
I'm sorry if the amount is less than 0, because this is

1391
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,900
Rotate left, which should rotate, which would move values to the left,

1392
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:06,500
right?

1393
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,000
So I guess I should phrase it this way.

1394
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,900
If the amount is greater than zero then I believe we want to shift it

1395
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,300
up.

1396
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,200
Right?

1397
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,600
And if the amount is let is not, then we want to shift it down.

1398
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,400
Right?

1399
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,400
I believe that would be the textbook, definition of rotate left.

1400
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:27,500
And in the case of the other way, round.

1401
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,600
We just convert them.

1402
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,300
So I think that should be correct.

1403
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,500
Now, what I will try here, so there's our image.

1404
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,600
What I will try here is, I will pound to find compiler msv.

1405
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,200
See to be 0, right?

1406
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,500
And we will see.

1407
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:47,300
No.

1408
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,400
All right, so I'll clearly I did not Implement that quite right.

1409
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,400
Let's take a look at that.

1410
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:51,800
Again.

1411
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,800
That's pretty funny.

1412
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,800
I did say rotate left should rotate up by amount when it's positive.

1413
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,800
Should it not?

1414
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,500
Is that not right?

1415
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,400
Hold on a second.

1416
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh, you know what though?

1417
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,100
Also, I don't know.

1418
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,100
Do we ever test our B can forward?

1419
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,300
Because I suppose that could be wrong as well.

1420
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,600
I don't actually know if that's true.

1421
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,000
If want to test result is test.

1422
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,700
I don't actually know if that's true.

1423
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,000
Let me just let me just verify first before I go to bug those

1424
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,600
routines.

1425
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,400
Let's actually verify Loops that this isn't broken.

1426
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,800
Okay, so that's correct.

1427
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:43,100
So these are not correct it go so I guess my brain is a bit fried.

1428
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,400
So if a match is greater than 0 then we should shift it left by the

1429
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,200
amount.

1430
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:54,500
I believe otherwise we should shift it right by that amount if it was

1431
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,400
- oh, yeah.

1432
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,100
Whoops not so much.

1433
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,100
Yeah, so obviously if

1434
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,100
Amount is - we don't want to try and tell it to do it - shift, which

1435
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:06,900
it can't do.

1436
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,900
So we have to negate the amount first.

1437
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,600
That's just yeah, that was just dumb.

1438
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,800
Yeah, so there we go.

1439
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,000
Happy day.

1440
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,600
Okay, thank you for reminding me.

1441
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,800
We'll get that posted.

1442
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,900
So that people won't have trouble compiling anymore.

1443
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,600
And, and, yeah, hopefully, that'll make it easier for them to to port

1444
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,000
to other platforms without trouble.

1445
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Is it a good idea to update the low entities in a separate thread?

1446
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,300
I don't know.

1447
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,400
I mean, it depends on the target platform.

1448
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,800
I don't think so largely because I don't think we're going to be doing

1449
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,700
enough, entity work on platforms that have spare threads running

1450
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,900
around, to make it necessary.

1451
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:48,400
So, like,

1452
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,200
I guess what I would say is.

1453
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,800
It depends how many extra threads we have sitting around, not doing

1454
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:56,300
anything.

1455
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:59,800
And I have a feeling that on the kinds of processors that.

1456
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Like quad-core or whatever, they're probably so fast that we won't

1457
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,500
really need to if that makes sense, but I don't know.

1458
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,200
So I assume, we could probably enter, leave it.

1459
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:13,100
And that actually have to do that.

1460
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,800
But we could one of the things that we might do is just update, you

1461
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:20,100
know, use threads to update the high entities as well.

1462
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,100
Each one can update like chunks of them or whatever.

1463
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,900
We could, we could do lots of different stuff.

1464
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,700
So we'll see what we do, but it's really not something we need to

1465
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,600
think about now.

1466
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,200
Have you ever done any big projects in a dynamically?

1467
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:36,800
Typed language?

1468
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:36,900
If?

1469
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,100
Yes, how did you handle the refractor without the compiler help?

1470
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:44,500
So I can tell you that actually, it's really a huge pain.

1471
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,600
Like I haven't done any really large projects and I know the type of

1472
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,500
language, but I did write a pretty big web thing in PHP one time.

1473
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:01,400
And if I remember correctly, there's some typing in that language and

1474
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,600
then there's a lot of non typing things like and it was not all just

1475
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:09,800
typing but it was also stuff like things can just come into existence

1476
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,800
without like there isn't like a hard notion of whether a variable was

1477
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,700
actually declared and stuff as well.

1478
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:21,500
You know, there's a lot of that and it's awful like it really is I

1479
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,300
don't have really any good suggestions my

1480
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,100
Justin is don't use a dynamically typed language for that reason.

1481
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:31,400
Like Dynamic typing is not necessarily a bad idea its own, but but you

1482
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,700
always want to, at least have static typing too.

1483
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:39,300
And so I'm, you know, there's definitely room for dynamic typing and

1484
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,400
it can be useful dietary.

1485
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:46,400
So, a useful concept, but man is for doing for doing real programming.

1486
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:51,100
Not having sex height, not having static type, checking to help you

1487
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,100
refactor things.

1488
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,300
Like the way we're doing here.

1489
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,600
Like you said is, is it Sam?

1490
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,500
It's a massive speed hit for me and I suspect it is for everybody.

1491
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,500
I don't think there's much you can do around it.

1492
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,300
So static typing is really, really good for these types of things.

1493
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,100
I've noticed some games physics and things break, when the FPS is

1494
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,600
increased.

1495
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,300
How does that kind of thing happen?

1496
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,600
If you don't tie the game takes to frame rate.

1497
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,000
What do you tie them to?

1498
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,500
So typically, if you have, if you have physics, that is time step

1499
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,899
dependent, meaning that it doesn't scale well to larger time steps

1500
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,600
then, typically, what?

1501
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, obviously what some people do is nothing and that's where you

1502
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,399
get the breakage that you're talking about.

1503
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,899
But what a lot of people will do is they'll

1504
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,500
Their physics at a constant time, step always.

1505
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:48,300
So the physics will always run say 60 frames a second or 120 frames

1506
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:48,800
per second.

1507
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:50,200
They'll always do that.

1508
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:56,100
And then all they do is if they have to do a larger frame update, they

1509
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:59,800
will still run the physics multiple times, but they'll just only draw.

1510
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,300
Result of having done it multiple times, right?

1511
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,500
So that's that's how people usually do it.

1512
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,899
I don't love physics as a gameplay thing.

1513
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,600
So I tend to not have to worry too much about that sort of sort of

1514
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,000
thing.

1515
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,700
So I try as much as possible to write things that are capable of

1516
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,500
scaling to relatively large time steps.

1517
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,800
So, you know, if they can get, they need to go down to 15 frames a

1518
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,100
second.

1519
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:27,700
They can.

1520
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,800
But I also try to not have frame.

1521
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Might be that variable.

1522
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,000
So I don't know.

1523
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:37,800
I realize that it becomes a very intractable problem for certain types

1524
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,200
of games.

1525
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,800
Like big open world 3D free.

1526
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,899
Look, moddable, blah, blah, blah.

1527
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:44,700
Like, there's all these things that make it, then you start having to

1528
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,200
give up your performance constraints and so on.

1529
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,200
But you know, I don't really care that much about those kinds of

1530
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:53,399
games.

1531
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:58,700
So I don't tend to program things looking for that, you know, so yeah,

1532
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,600
so I try to just avoid that whole problem, but I don't envy the people

1533
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,700
who have to deal with it because it is, it's a heart, it's a

1534
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,900
legitimately hard problem.

1535
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,000
It's not like the people are just crappy programmers.

1536
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,200
It's like, it's legitimately hard.

1537
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,000
You have to do a lot of kind of extra work there to make sure that

1538
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,300
that sort of stuff doesn't fail physics.

1539
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,800
Physics is hard like real physics is

1540
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:18,700
Hard problem.

1541
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,900
It's really nasty.

1542
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,500
You're just shifting not rotating.

1543
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,300
If that's true.

1544
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,400
I feel like we name these improperly because we don't actually care

1545
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,700
about the rotate.

1546
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,700
All we actually care about is the shift by a bio - like being able to

1547
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,100
shift by a variable amount.

1548
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,900
So we could actually named this something entirely different if we

1549
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:47,700
wanted to, but I'm not sure what we should name it.

1550
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,500
Like we don't actually need to rotate if that makes sense, but I could

1551
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,700
do I could do the or trick.

1552
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,500
If we actually wanted to implement an or here.

1553
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
I'm if we actually wanted to implement a rotate here, right?

1554
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,800
The or trick is escapes me now, but it's like you shift in both

1555
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,700
directions and you or it together or something like this, right?

1556
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,600
What is the trick?

1557
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,600
You know, you don't talk about people out there who are b, b, twiddly,

1558
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,700
kind of things, rotate, two shifts.

1559
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:25,400
And and or her can you type something like that into Google?

1560
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,600
No, apparently not.

1561
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:31,700
Oh well.

1562
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:35,500
You know what?

1563
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,800
I'm talking about there, right?

1564
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,700
Hopefully people who know exactly.

1565
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,800
Yeah, we could let me I guess I could try to work it out.

1566
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,500
You're on the stream.

1567
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,200
I'm not the right person for this sort of, this is more of a Jeff

1568
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,400
Roberts question, sort of the old bit Shifty tricks.

1569
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,600
But okay.

1570
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,700
So what do we need to do here?

1571
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,400
If we actually want to implement a rotate, which we don't need but you

1572
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,300
know, we just said we're going to do it for some reason, right?

1573
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:06,200
Then what we've got is we have some values here, right?

1574
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:14,700
A BB CC DD or something like this and we now want to be able to go

1575
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,300
role in either direction.

1576
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,300
Right?

1577
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,600
And we want the stuff that comes out the top to come back on the

1578
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,100
bottom, right?

1579
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:30,100
So, assuming that the number was originally positive, right?

1580
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,300
Assuming that we were talking about a positive number.

1581
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,300
So let's say we were shifting up by a positive number, right?

1582
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:40,800
Then what we need to do is we would need to say, okay.

1583
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,500
Obviously, we just shift this thing up by whatever the positive number

1584
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,700
is, right.

1585
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
So let's say we did it this way BBC.

1586
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,500
See I don't know why I'm even why am I even having that many things in

1587
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:52,800
there.

1588
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,200
Get rid of that?

1589
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,100
A b, c.

1590
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:57,600
D.

1591
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,700
E, f.

1592
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:01,500
Yeah.

1593
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:02,900
All right.

1594
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:05,600
So if I shift it up, let's say I shift it up by 2.

1595
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,200
So then I have C D E F and I've got two blank spots, right?

1596
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,600
And so what I need to do, if I shift it up by 2 is I need to basically

1597
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:19,200
recapture the to top things so that they end up down at the bottom.

1598
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,400
So what I need to do is I need to shift this guy.

1599
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,000
I need to shift him down so that he lines up here, right?

1600
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,700
And obviously that's just however, many bits there were

1601
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,900
Which in the case of what we were inputting their with 32, right?

1602
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:38,600
That's how many bits there were - the number here.

1603
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,300
So, it's just - this shift.

1604
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,400
It's the number of bits - to shift.

1605
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,500
It would shift it down and and line up there.

1606
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,200
Right?

1607
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,400
So if I wanted to actually do the rotate, but I would have to do is

1608
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,400
say, okay.

1609
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,200
I'm going to shift the value up by the amount and I'm going to or it

1610
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,800
with the value shifted down by 32 minus the amount.

1611
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,700
I believe that's the

1612
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,700
Actual correct version, right?

1613
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,800
That's, that's what you would do to, to produce the thing.

1614
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,200
Now.

1615
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,400
The only thing I don't know about is, do I still need to check for?

1616
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,700
What's the what will actually happen if that number is negative?

1617
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,700
When we do the shift if the shift is negative.

1618
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:27,200
Then, what happens to this value?

1619
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,500
Is my only question.

1620
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,300
Because of the shift is negative, then this value will that will shift

1621
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:35,400
out to nothing.

1622
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,300
So yes, I don't know that that still works at all.

1623
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,600
If the shift value were - because this would shift down by an amount.

1624
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,000
That was too high.

1625
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:47,800
Right.

1626
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,400
So I feel like we kind of still have to do the check, but maybe I'm

1627
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,300
wrong about that.

1628
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:58,000
Anyway, so there's that version and then here's the other version,

1629
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:58,800
right?

1630
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
This one would shift it down.

1631
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,500
On by - the amount and then presumably we would want to do the exact

1632
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,300
same thing.

1633
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,700
Let's go put this pen down.

1634
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,100
So if the amount we're - then we're just shifting down by - the amount

1635
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,500
and shifting up by 32, plus the amount, right?

1636
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:20,600
I would assume you like, that's, that's roughly, correct.

1637
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:25,300
And then this other one is just the exact same thing with with

1638
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,400
everything reversed.

1639
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,000
Right?

1640
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,000
That makes sense.

1641
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,800
So, so there we go.

1642
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Oh, that's going to be that's going to be down and it up and up and

1643
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:39,700
down.

1644
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,200
And then I got to actually go test this because I kind of just pulled

1645
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,100
that out of nowhere.

1646
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:49,000
So I want to actually see if that that actually does what I expected

1647
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,600
to do.

1648
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,900
So in order to do that, I'm just going to go ahead and write at the

1649
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,000
beginning of handmade dot CPP here.

1650
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,800
When we enter the code.

1651
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,200
I'm just going to go ahead and call it.

1652
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,900
So, structured art for the

1653
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,200
In, I'll do a zero.

1654
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:07,500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, right?

1655
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,300
We go.

1656
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:15,300
And then I'll do a rotate left left.

1657
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:22,500
We will rotate a and we'll rotate it by, let's say five.

1658
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,200
Well, let's just do an even multiple.

1659
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,800
So we'll do for and then we'll also do negative 4.

1660
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:35,500
Or just so we can see if that works at all for rotten egg for and then

1661
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,600
we'll do the same with, right.

1662
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,300
Okay.

1663
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:44,500
So now I'll just step in and see whether the rotation actually works

1664
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,000
again.

1665
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,800
I don't really know why we're doing this other than for amusement sake

1666
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,700
because I guess we named it rotate.

1667
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,800
We might as well rotate.

1668
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,900
So there's a rotate, the thing we're rotating.

1669
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:57,400
Right.

1670
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,200
And let's see if this works at all.

1671
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,200
So when we run left, we should get.

1672
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,400
Something that slid up and put the, let's see if we rotate left by 4.

1673
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,800
Then we should see the top number shift into the bottom and everything

1674
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,800
else should shift up.

1675
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,100
And that's what happened.

1676
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,100
Let's see what happens when we do our Rock left negged for, that

1677
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:26,100
should be the opposite effect, and it is, so that's good.

1678
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,900
And then, the rot left for the see.

1679
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:34,000
These should basically be the same, but they should be opposite.

1680
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So those should be the same.

1681
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,100
Yes, and then rod

1682
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,900
For should be the same as the top one.

1683
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:38,400
And it is.

1684
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,800
So that looks about, right.

1685
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,500
I think, of course, we probably don't handle arbitrarily High values

1686
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,500
there because if the values got more than one full rotation, we would

1687
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,000
support it.

1688
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,400
But that's okay because I suspect that the processor probably would

1689
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,900
get mad at us for that as well too.

1690
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,400
So, there we go.

1691
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,600
We've implanted some rotations.

1692
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,700
I'm not sure.

1693
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,200
Think that I was wondering is I don't actually know what happens when

1694
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,700
you rotate.

1695
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,800
I'm just interested to know shift by.

1696
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,000
- I don't know what.

1697
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,800
I don't know what happens.

1698
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,500
If I if I shift by negative 1, I don't know.

1699
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,500
Okay, so you basically just it basically, just doesn't even let you

1700
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,300
compile it.

1701
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:24,100
I guess undefined Behavior because I don't actually know what would

1702
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,500
happen if we actually did that.

1703
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,200
So yeah, so we can't actually allow a - go in there.

1704
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,900
So I guess that means we have to do and I'm out because we can't pass

1705
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,600
a negative value to it.

1706
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,500
So unless there's some kind of trick you can use to get around that.

1707
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:36,700
All right.

1708
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,200
There we go.

1709
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,600
Let's see.

1710
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:57,400
Is there any gameplay reason why we want to keep entities live even

1711
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:58,700
when they are off the screen?

1712
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,500
Yes.

1713
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,000
So kind of the way I think thinking about this game is I want there to

1714
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,500
be a lot of stuff happening around potentially like, oh, you know,

1715
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:11,500
there's a little dude who like goes from place to place.

1716
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,900
And so when you happen upon him, he's actually going somewhere.

1717
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:19,400
And not you know, he just was waiting there, dormant the entire time.

1718
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,600
So I kind of wanted to minimize the number of dormant entities and say

1719
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,600
It's going to be lots of entities that have an agenda or an agency in

1720
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,500
the game, just for fun.

1721
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:27,700
Largely.

1722
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:29,900
I don't know that that's necessarily good game design, but it's just

1723
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,300
more like it's more programming work that we have to do because it's

1724
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,500
way simpler to just sleep.

1725
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,100
All the entities all the time when they're not on the screen, and I

1726
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,900
wanted to do something harder than that.

1727
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,300
Like I said, my goal is to make the game engine for the actual core

1728
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:45,500
gameplay, be way better than most games.

1729
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,800
I see, rather than making it less complicated.

1730
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,000
I want to make it more complicated so I can show how to handle that

1731
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,600
complexity because I think that's interesting for educational.

1732
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,100
Mrs.

1733
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,900
Is there any reason to do it?

1734
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,900
Gameplay-wise not my position to say?

1735
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,500
Let's see.

1736
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,400
So people on the stream are basically agreeing with me that you cannot

1737
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,700
shift by a negative value.

1738
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,400
But they were saying that you could do amount equals amount and 31 in

1739
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,800
skip conditional and use only amount greater than 0 code.

1740
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,300
Is that actually true?

1741
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,600
I don't know if I believe that.

1742
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,800
because wouldn't that be a very large number if you do amount and 31

1743
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,800
that would basically be

1744
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,300
Oh, I see what you're saying.

1745
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,100
No, that doesn't make good sense, I guess.

1746
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,400
They were saying, basically, if I could do this.

1747
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:04,800
Right, then that would basically eliminate.

1748
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,400
All of the values that were going to be greater.

1749
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:19,100
Like so we know that we can only rotate within that range.

1750
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,100
So then we know that we would only be doing rotations that actually

1751
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:24,600
work though.

1752
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,300
I don't know.

1753
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,400
I don't know if I I don't super understand that yet.

1754
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,000
I'm trying to think of whether that's, let's see what happens.

1755
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,100
Let's go back to the white board.

1756
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,300
This was basically to people on the street were talking about how to

1757
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:35,600
avoid.

1758
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,100
Because memorize asking just moments ago.

1759
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,600
How do you avoid the conditional?

1760
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:39,600
Right?

1761
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,200
And I sing, I think there was a trick for up.

1762
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:41,800
I wasn't sure.

1763
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,700
So what they were saying is well, what you could

1764
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,700
Do is you could and with 31, right?

1765
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,500
And what 31 is right, is that the five bottom bits are set, right?

1766
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,600
So that's that's these bits are set.

1767
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
And then all the rest are not right.

1768
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:00,400
So that would be anything up to 32 not inclusive would basically be

1769
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,300
represented in there.

1770
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,300
And so if it was a negative number, right, then you would end up with

1771
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,700
these being.

1772
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,500
It would it would since its two's complement.

1773
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,600
It would still be all of these would be set if it was negative 30.

1774
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,700
One, right?

1775
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:20,700
And if any of them weren't set would decrease downwards to - right 29

1776
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,100
- 28 and so on.

1777
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,300
So that's kind of cool.

1778
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,600
I think I kind of like that.

1779
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,100
Right?

1780
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,400
So basically, this knocks out the part that wouldn't work and it turns

1781
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,100
it into a properly unsigned number that actually does the shift that

1782
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,600
we want it to do because of the fact that we're doing both shifts

1783
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,800
anyway, so in theory,

1784
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:44,500
See here in theory.

1785
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:53,000
I think we could do something like this.

1786
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:59,800
If I understand, if I understand their suggestion correctly, so let's

1787
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,400
take a look.

1788
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:11,500
Pound Define to Pilar MSC and there we go.

1789
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:12,700
Okay.

1790
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,200
First of all, do we even run?

1791
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:14,800
Yes, we do.

1792
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:18,900
So now let's go ahead and step in and verify that that actually still

1793
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:19,300
works.

1794
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:21,400
Okay.

1795
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,300
Lovely.

1796
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,200
Well, that's very nice.

1797
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,000
Okay.

1798
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Thank you stream.

1799
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:27,700
That is a good.

1800
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,600
That is a good trick.

1801
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,000
All right, so I think that's about it.

1802
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,200
I'm going to go ahead and delete this test code for our rotate there.

1803
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,300
This as well.

1804
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,600
So, we're back to actually using the actual rotate instruction down.

1805
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,100
Okay.

1806
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,200
All right.

1807
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,700
I think we're just about out of time, as well.

1808
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,900
It's 9:27.

1809
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,400
I guess we have time for probably one more question.

1810
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,900
If there is another question on the stream, looks,

1811
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,300
Everything is is pretty much.

1812
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,400
Like I said, it's where a little bit broken because we had to remove

1813
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,500
some features and we're going to have to go ahead and put the back in

1814
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,600
tomorrow because obviously, we ran out of time to do all the cleanup

1815
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,500
that I wanted to do, but we'll do it tomorrow and it'll be good.

1816
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:17,600
And and so yeah, we'll leave it like that but doesn't look like

1817
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,700
there's any more questions as far as I can tell.

1818
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,300
Anyone questions, no questions.

1819
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,100
All right, then I guess we're done.

1820
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:35,300
I guess the stream has ended, and I will go ahead and close it down.

1821
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,500
There we go, and we'll sort of prepare ourselves for success by

1822
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,500
clearing carita.

1823
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:44,400
Here we go.

1824
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,900
And okay.

1825
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,300
All right.

1826
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:52,000
Well, if there are no other questions, and I think there aren't

1827
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,300
519 lat.

1828
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,400
Yes, the Jesus asked me if the Anthony one thing will work for

1829
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:58,800
negative values.

1830
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,000
Yes.

1831
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,400
That's exactly what it is for basically.

1832
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,800
All that does is just knock out the actual - part of the negative

1833
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,700
number and turn it into a small number between 0 and 30.

1834
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,700
One that happens to invert properly if it was a negative number

1835
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:18,700
originally so that the shifts do the right thing kind of a wacky idea

1836
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:22,200
basically, but you know, that's how those kind of bit twiddling

1837
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:22,700
things.

1838
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,600
Tend to be I got to remember to fix this because it ends a minute

1839
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,300
early, right?

1840
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:31,400
So everything's one minute early right now because it's a yeah, it's a

1841
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,200
little premature.

1842
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,200
I got to go fix that.

1843
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:38,100
But anyway, thank you very much for joining me for another edition of

1844
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,800
handmade hero.

1845
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm glad we started to do some cleanup work today, on our entity

1846
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,100
architecture.

1847
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,000
I think that's going to be really nice to kind of be in a place where

1848
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
we know that, we're either in float, or in tile space.

1849
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,700
And we can kind of compartmentalize those two and not have to deal

1850
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:51,300
with it anymore.

1851
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,300
So that'll be kind of nice.

1852
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,700
But still have all of the niceness of being able to have a giant

1853
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,100
world.

1854
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,500
I think that's, you know, going to be a good trade-off and I said

1855
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,500
there's a couple weirdnesses there.

1856
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,400
Specifically what happens when you're talking about people who are

1857
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:07,800
looking at other entities that maybe aren't actually in the high space

1858
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:08,300
and so on.

1859
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,800
So there's, there's some weirdness is that I got to think about

1860
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,000
exactly how we want to deal with.

1861
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,100
But hopefully they'll all kind of work themselves out relatively

1862
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,200
cleanly, so hopefully you'll join me tomorrow, same time.

1863
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,400
Same place 8:00 p.m.

1864
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,300
Pacific Standard Time.

1865
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,100
Right here on Twitch.

1866
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:22,900
When we will finish that.

1867
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,700
Up and get things running very nice and smooth.

1868
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,300
I hope if you would like to follow along at home.

1869
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:32,800
You can pre-order the game comes with the source code so you can

1870
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,800
download it every night after I finish.

1871
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,600
I upload the latest source code to send out and you can use the link

1872
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,200
to get your email to download it every day.

1873
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,900
That's a great way to follow along at home and kind of just play

1874
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,100
around the code in.

1875
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,200
It's just it's a lot of fun and it's easy.

1876
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,800
It's pretty easy.

1877
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,200
Once you get it set up to just kind of grab the changes every night

1878
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,300
and play around with them.

1879
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,900
if you'd like to support the series, we do have a patreon, you can

1880

It's got an episode guide so you can catch up on old episodes.

1886
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,300
It's got a coding resources page where people have done ports to like

1887
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,000
mac and Linux.

1888
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:16,300
It's got code discussion where you can go and post.

1889
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:16,900
It's like a forum.

1890
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,400
You can go and post questions and talk with our people and so it's

1891
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,400
just it's pretty handy.

1892
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,300

If for some reason I do not

1896
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,900
Not take it easy, everyone.
