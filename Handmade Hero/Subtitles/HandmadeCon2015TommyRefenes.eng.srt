1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
You ready to go?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,200
Okay, I think it's 10:30 so I'd like to get started because we really

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,900
just don't have any time for breaks and I apologize for that but I

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
just felt like we should take as much time as possible to talk to

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
people are coming here because honestly like I'm super excited to talk

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,700
to them.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,000
I hope you are too but you know at the end of the day I get I'm going

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,700
to ask the question.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,200
So I want to I want to keep all our 15 minutes to myself.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
Thank you very much for coming to hand make on.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,500
I am absolutely, like, shocked to see so many people here and there

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,100
was like a meat.

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,400
Last night at the Seven Stars pepper and there's a couple other ones

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,900
that people are organizing online and I went there and we took like a

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,000
brief show of hands.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,300
It was like, how many people traveled to get here?

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,300
And it was like, everyone and people were like, yeah, I flew 22 hours

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,900
to get here unless I just like I do not know what to say other than

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,800
thank you so much for that.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,700
I mean this is this is a $35 conference and I don't even want to know

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,900
how much it must have cost to get here from some of those places.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
And so, we will be doing our absolute best.

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
To make it worth your while.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,500
So I don't want to take very much time with introduction.

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,200
So I'm just going to say really quickly.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,000
We are trying to record it.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,300
So hopefully there will be video afterwards and we're trying to record

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,300
both, what's on the screen and what's coming, you know, what's

29
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,800
happening up here.

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,900
So hopefully that'll work out well and we'll have stuff afterwards.

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,500
The streams are what we could do with what we had.

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,100
So they may go down, they may not if you're watching at home up there

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,500
on the stream, I apologize.

34
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,700
If it's a little spotty that was it was the best we could do, but

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,900
hopefully you'll be able to see everything.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,800
The fact at the very least and here's how this is basically going to

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,400
work, I'm going to talk to each programmer and we're going to go

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,800
through all of the stuff that I want to know about the things that

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
they're working with and just kind of go in detail about like what

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,000
they're working on what they have worked on like you know what their

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
perspectives are on things.

42
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,900
How they approach coding all that sorts of stuff and I don't think

43
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,100
we're going to be able to do time for questions during we might but I

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,800
have a feeling we're going to like fill up all the time.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,900
So what I'd like to do is just say anyone who has a question

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Kitchen that they think of that they would like answered, I will take

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,300
all the questions on Twitter so you can do at senior ettore and just

48
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,700
tweet the question at me, I will gather them all up tomorrow and then

49
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,600
I will actually email everyone who we spoke to and if they have time

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,800
to answer some of them, I will, I will go back on stream, but I might

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
filter, I might filter.

52
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
So try to keep it, just a programming questions, you know, not

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
designed questions or those sorts of things because we try to keep it

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
mostly to program him here.

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,900
So that's it for the, for the, for the boilerplate.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,600
So, you know, I just like get started.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,200
The first person we have is, well, everyone knows his game.

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,100
Everyone's played Super Meat Boy, so I that needs no introduction, but

59
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,300
you may never have seen him in person.

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Tommy reference, ladies and gentlemen.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,200
And we're going to talk a bunch about the controller stuff, but but

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
before we get to that, I kind of wanted to start off by saying, I

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
don't even know.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Really much of the history of pre Meat Boy.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,100
So I had a bunch of questions.

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,200
I want to ask about that, boy and the first thing I wanted to find out

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,500
was how do you, how do we get to me by?

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Like where are you in your life at the time when you're like hey what

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,100
is, you know, we're going to do this project together, right?

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,400
Okay so I've got sick so well, not sick, but cough, cough, just is me.

71
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,900
I know I'm gonna I'm gonna make sure everybody's got something to take

72
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,000
on.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Want to aerosol that?

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,600
So back in 1999 2000.

76
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,100
There was a site called new grounds, and I think most people know

77
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,800
about Newgrounds.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,100
I think and on Newgrounds, I made terrible.

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,700
Terrible.

80
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,800
Flash games and terrible flash animations.

81
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
And so did Edmund and we sort of met up.

82
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,200
And then we both went our separate ways like before.

83
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,700
Like I went and got into web development, stuff PHP.

84
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,100
MySQL.

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,900
I wrote real estate databases, which sounds really boring, but it was

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,800
a lot of fun.

87
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,300
Yeah.

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,100
So, you know like okay, you know, Zillow?

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
And how they show everybody's listings.

91
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,800
Yeah, that's actually called broker reciprocity.

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,700
Okay, so that's the thing where every agent can grab the listings and

93
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,600
so other agent stuff, and they get like, percentages, blah, blah, all

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,300
that stuff, but the complicated fund problem with that is all MLS

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,800
systems are stupid and know.

96
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
None of them are centralized.

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,100
So, my first actual job, aside from Little contract jobs here and

98
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,500
there was writing real estate database software that took like five

99
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,900
different databases in Western North Carolina and integrated them into

100
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
one searchable thing.

101
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,600
That was my job, that was like, when I was 20 and that was super fun.

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,400
That's crazy.

103
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,200
I had no idea.

104
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,600
Yeah.

105
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:52,900
Yeah.

106
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,200
And it was, yeah, it was, it was just the in Western North Carolina,

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,800
they had just entered,

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
State and I was this new programmer.

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,300
The only programmer at this little web place that was managed by this

110
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,800
moron.

111
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,300
And oh, man, this is being recorded, you know, he's a moron and he

112
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,100
knows he's a moron.

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,100
I'm not going to say is I won't say his name, I could say his name.

114
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,800
No, it's not human, his name's Blake Butler, you're never gonna find

115
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:19,900
him.

116
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:21,700
Okay.

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
But yeah.

118
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,900
So that was my job and that was sort of, you know, MySQL PHP stuff and

119
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,800
during that whole time

120
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,100
I'm I always was trying to make my little game engine and never really

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,200
I had flash.

122
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,200
So that was mainly what I was making stuff in and trying to make like

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
a game engines.

124
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Were two things and Flash, just sort of tinkering around.

125
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,000
But my day job was always just, you know, web stuff this and that and

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,100
then after that job, I moved to Charlotte.

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,200
I wasn't Asheville.

128
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,100
I moved to Charlotte and got a job at a place that was doing

129
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,100
educational like almost games, but they were like an educational

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,700
portal.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
And that was just dealing with hundreds of thousands of users.

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,900
So mainly my life was all database stuff and building applications for

133
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,000
people like teachers and stuff.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,300
So how do you get from that?

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,300
Touka Super Meat.

136
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,200
Boy is all written like in C++.

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,100
Yeah, it's so how do you get from that as what you were doing to?

138
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,800
Like, I'm going to build a whole game engine myself using.

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,200
None of these things not using Flash not using yeah, it right.

140
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
What what did that process look like?

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,400
Does that mean?

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,500
So how that happened was?

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,200
As I was doing all that work, I was doing bunch of contract work and I

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,500
was doing stuff for like Duraflame in NASCAR like just and I would

145
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
just spend all my time doing all this work.

146
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,800
That was fun for my brain, but not for the creative fun, part of my

147
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,200
brain.

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
And one day I was reading an e GM and electronic gaming monthly.

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,300
I don't even know if they exist anymore, but they did an interview

150
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,600
with the guy that was

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,500
Coating.

152
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,800
The fishing minigame in Twilight, Princess and check and he was doing

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
it actually wasn't an interview with him.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
It was an interview about Twilight Princess, but they had this little

155
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,700
thing and the reason there was a fishing minigame in Twilight.

156
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,900
Princess is because this one programmer loved fishing.

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,800
And in his off time, he made the fishing minigame, okay?

158
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,500
And I read that and I went, I make shit for Duraflame.

159
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,800
I don't want to do this anymore, so around that time, was this all?

160
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,200
So because of your shared, passion of fishing, I have fish.

161
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,100
Yes, of fishing and my hatred of Durham.

162
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Yes, understood.

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
They have a weird slogan, by the way.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
Duraflame, what is their slow car?

165
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Is that the log?

166
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Yeah.

167
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, you put in the fireplace when you like the log on fire.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Yeah, that's like really a log.

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,600
It's like compressed post-process materials.

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,200
And yeah, it's really stinky like gasoline log, as what it is, but it

171
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,500
works.

172
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,900
It burns for a long time, but their slogan when I saw it over

173
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Thanksgiving.

174
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
It's something like, tonight's the night.

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's something really weird like okay so amazing.

176
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,900
Yeah.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,200
So okay after my friend had gotten a good jobs more romantic than a

178
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,600
giant.

179
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Hey baby.

180
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,900
Yeah, hey baby.

181
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,600
Let's pop that Duraflame and let's make some Sparks.

182
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,800
Yeah, that's how I met my wife.

183
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,300
It's over a Duraflame log.

184
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,400
Yeah, it works.

185
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
So my friend had got a job at a company.

187
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,300
In Amsterdam was also managed by morons.

188
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,000
This is a weird,

189
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,800
Friend for me, that's management.

190
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,400
And they needed a network programmer.

191
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,600
And I am done, much sleep loss.

192
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,799
Plus an old long time like little bits here and there and I did an

193
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,100
interview with them and I convinced them that I knew C++, well enough

194
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
to get the job.

195
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,600
All right?

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,400
And so I learned a lot of C++ on the plane to Amsterdam and then I got

197
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,900
there and learned more and more and more and was able to learn fast

198
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,800
enough that they couldn't.

199
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,300
They couldn't catch me.

200
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:01,900
Okay.

201
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,300
Yeah.

202
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,600
And and from there, I was like Network program and then I worked up to

203
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,500
like lead engine programmer because I just it was I wasn't, we weren't

204
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
building our own engine.

205
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,300
We were basically taking the unreal 2x engine and porting it to 360

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,300
which 2x was terrible because it was a it was a hack on unreal to and

207
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,900
then to take that the 360 was crazy but I was doing all these like was

208
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,900
a command buffer optimizations and all this stuff to make.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
It like actually they oh my God.

210
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:37,400
They had their artists have no concept of what card we're can do.

211
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,700
Okay?

212
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,500
So this was an Xbox 360 and they had models with fingernails that were

213
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:52,700
Model geometry and textures that were for it was like for 4096 by for

214
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,700
like 4,000 96-well for their face.

215
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,100
Okay.

216
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no way to get the emotions.

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Yeah.

218
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,800
Without the yeah, you've seen the video.

219
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Yeah, you need the fingernails are part of the acting.

220
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,200
The the best part though, is the characters were never more than this

221
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
big on the screen.

222
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Well, you and I had constant my emotions in there, even if you can't

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:11,900
see it.

224
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,700
It's yeah.

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,300
So like IGN's, like was a great game especially the finger at this.

227
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh my God.

228
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,000
Those were great.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Fingernail cannot a.

230
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,700
Did they add a new fingernails rating?

231
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,600
I did a whole fingernail Shader.

232
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,100
It was amazing.

233
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Yeah.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,800
But I that's where I was like

235
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
Like I was all into like the optimization stuff.

236
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,400
I was actually had a lot of time where you were doing.

237
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,300
See this engine work.

238
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,700
Oh yeah.

239
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,100
It was yeah like that.

240
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,000
That was like my whole job was.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
Make sure this shitty game called hoop world, that eventually came

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,700
out, but not on 360, make sure, but make sure it runs at 60 frames a

243
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,000
second.

244
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,300
And that was my job.

245
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,800
And that was like, I was doing all sorts of fun stuff.

246
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Like, I was trying to figure out a way to

247
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,500
Make animation textures, where it would encode, the matrices in the

248
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,400
texture and use that in, like instead of having like, all the Shader

249
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,500
constants and everything because there's a really super slow going

250
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:12,700
through.

251
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm like, well, if we just use this and it didn't work, but but it was

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,600
what I wanted a shot.

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah, it was fun to do.

254
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,300
And it was like, I was, that's how I was like learning about like

255
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,300
optimizations and how like, you know, how all this stuff sort of works

256
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,700
together.

257
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,800
And that was my job for about 10 months until the company kind of

258
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
went terrible.

259
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,600
And so this is that's also 360 practice.

260
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,100
Yeah, that was 360 practice.

261
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,400
So I was like, super familiar with 360 Hardware, then quit that job

262
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
and a friend of mine.

263
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,000
Aubree Aubree has children.

264
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,400
He's a good guy.

265
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
We started a game together.

266
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,400
He was the lead designer on hoop world.

267
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,000
I was program.

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We started a game together where his game called goo which came out

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,900
the same time as world of coup.

270
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,800
Which that?

271
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,300
Yeah, but yeah, it was a very good game, okay?

272
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
World of Google, not not my game.

273
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, no world.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,600
It was amazing.

275
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,000
My game was terrible.

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,100
Okay, but it was super physics stuff.

277
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,800
It was multi-threaded physics craziness and that was my hey, let's

278
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
have multi-threaded fun.

279
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,100
Okay, the kind of time and that's when I learned a whole bunch about

280
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,200
threading and my game, kind of went nowhere, and then around that

281
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
time, I was looking at igf winners because goo had

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Got into the igf and I'm like, oh, cool.

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,800
I look through winners.

284
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,100
And I see gesh.

285
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,500
And I'm like, oh, because I have this thing where I have to like, see

286
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,000
everything who made this, who made this and been made that I'm like,

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,400
oh, I'm like, I wonder if I still have them on instant messenger and

288
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,600
like I did when we started talking and then, you know, I went to Santa

289
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,400
Cruz because we were going to do Gish to for 360, but that fell

290
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
through, okay.

291
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
And then meatboy sort of happened.

292
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,800
And by that time I had the goo engine and then

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
I was like, well, I'm going to revamp this because I always revamp

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,600
stuff, so I'm like, well, revamp this for Meat Boy.

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,500
And then, yeah, from that made the tile engine made the tile editor

296
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,300
made all of those thingies for, that's kind of Interest, like I never

297
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,200
knew that Baxter actually.

298
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,000
So yeah, actually it, that is kind of like almost a training montage,

299
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
that whole thing, pretty much made up to Super Meat Boy, yes.

300
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,900
All the things they were like, you know, all the hardships.

301
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah.

302
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,600
Turns out to be really useful.

303
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,100
Yeah, for the bigot.

304
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,900
So let me ask about the Super Meat Boy than actually.

305
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,800
Gotta keep, I gotta keep.

306
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,600
Checking the clock.

307
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
So I know what times were at, oh, yeah.

308
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,900
So let's talk a little bit about that the, the whole tile editor

309
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,200
stuff.

310
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,100
I kind of want to ask a little about that especially, because this is

311
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,500
something that, that, that always is in my brain for some reason,

312
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:42,800
right?

313
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,600
Which is okay, so especially on something like Super Meat Boy, right?

314
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,200
You've got a situation where you guys weren't even in the same

315
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,800
location.

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,200
No, no.

317
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
I was in North Carolina because you're separated.

318
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,700
Yeah.

319
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,600
So how did you guys go about figuring out that art process?

320
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,800
Because you had like, again, you got your own custom engine, right?

321
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
He works in whatever tools.

322
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
He works in a glass.

323
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,900
Yeah, normally use this, right?

324
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,300
Yeah.

325
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,100
And so, for date day one, okay.

326
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
We should probably also turn off.

327
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,300
I didn't say, silence your cell phones?

328
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,200
Because I normally don't actually care about that, but I should not

329
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
say, yeah, right next to the Sea.

330
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Now, you know why they say it?

331
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah, point being, yeah.

332
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,000
You sit down and you're like me, you know, need to start building this

333
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,900
game and maybe there were some decisions.

334
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,600
I guess you made from the previous game in terms of how art would come

335
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
in, but like, you're

336
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Work with Edmund.

337
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,200
He needs to put all this content in.

338
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,800
How did you select work through that process?

339
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,400
Was it iterative or did you know upfront, what you need to like, give

340
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,500
me some, give me some sort of insight into if I'm in that situation.

341
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
You just drop me in in place of you.

342
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
What, what is like?

343
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,500
What are all the things to think about?

344
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,000
And how you got an efficient way of like implementing the, you know,

345
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,800
did you do importers or exporters or how, you know, give me that whole

346
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,100
thing.

347
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,900
So my kind of philosophy about that and about working with any artist

348
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800
is you the way

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
You get the best workout of people is by giving them the easiest way

350
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
to give you the best work.

351
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,100
So when it came to Edmund oh some Applause of people who approve.

352
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay.

353
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Well so with Edmund he works in Flash and I was familiar with flash

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,500
and my thinking was because at one point before like right before and

355
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,900
I'm like I was trying to make some particle effects for goo and I'm

356
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,800
like yeah, you know, I can make a thing and I'm just like well

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm basically just making Flash keyframing interface, but without all

358
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,300
the stuff flash because Flash for his terrible.

359
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,600
It is, as it is, it's decent in animation.

360
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,100
Okay.

361
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
So with Ed, he only works in Flash, okay?

362
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
And I was like, you know, why fight it?

363
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:55,200
So Kyle gabler World of Goo had told me about because I came up in a

364
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,800
conversation or something about how they did the art for World of Goo.

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,500
And Kyle gabler uses Flash and he's like, well, they flash has this

366
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,500
extendable GS FL thing.

367
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
It's like little Java files that can run in the idea and just automate

368
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,300
a bunch of process.

369
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm like, okay, okay.

370
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,100
So this is actually like a scripting system that's inside.

371
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Yeah, it's called J SF.

372
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,600
L, it's still around.

373
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,400
This is a JavaScript thing that you you, right?

374
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,700
So it's basically like the same as the actionscript stuff.

375
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,600
You write it in there?

376
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,300
Yeah, it's like if it's weird, you would think they would have just

377
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,800
made it action script but it's a weird version.

378
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,500
Version of java like a weird version of JavaScript JavaScript.

379
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,200
Yeah.

380
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:40,200
And then you can integrate that into like the Java C libraries.

381
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,700
So you can make like, dlls that load into the interface.

382
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,500
It's really crazy.

383
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,800
You can do it ton with.

384
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So, so inside the flash, JavaScript, you can actually load a CDL that

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
yeah, external.

386
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,200
Yeah.

387
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
And then you can call functions to it.

388
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
You can call functions to.

389
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,200
Yeah.

390
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,300
So, so, all right.

391
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,800
So what I did and you can, can you pass data?

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,700
Somebody as well.

393
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah so you can actually sort of Curry.

394
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
Get get the flash information.

395
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,800
Yeah.

396
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,800
Pipe it out using this JavaScript.

397
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,900
Shim sort of okay sort of okay so that's this is where this is where

398
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,000
the craziness comes in.

399
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:20,300
So I I wanted to have well what Kyle, gabler think that is it just

400
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,800
basically took every symbol because in Flash everything is a symbol.

401
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,099
Okay.

402
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,900
And you know, the it just took as just separate png's and I'm like,

403
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,800
that's cool but you know,

404
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,400
No, with a lot of the meat boy stuff.

405
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,500
It's tiny and small.

406
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,300
I don't need a tiny PNG.

407
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Okay.

408
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,400
I'm like, I need to make a good texture Atlas, so what I did.

409
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,200
So hold on a second for people don't know all of that stuff.

410
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,500
So what you're saying is basically in the World of Goo pipeline, what

411
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,100
they did is they literally took everything that the artist had made in

412
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Flash and the output, like each frame, or whatever of every and

413
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,700
something like that.

414
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Well, I don't think it was H frame because the animations themselves

415
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,700
are like he frame.

416
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,600
There's like motion tweens and everything but like the actual symbols

417
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,800
like

418
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
He drew a little goo ball and it needed to move.

419
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,000
They would export the goo ball and the animation animation.

420
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Yes.

421
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,800
Everything's okay.

422
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,300
Yeah.

423
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,200
And then you want to do a texture Atlas.

424
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,000
I want to do a texture Atlas and Export the animations.

425
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because the detail that we had in the things that we had in the amount

426
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,500
of assets we had it was better to have, you know, 10 texture Atlas has

427
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,100
than 1,000 images or well.

428
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,300
Okay.

429
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,700
So you want to take all the symbols you want to pack them into?

430
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

431
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,600
A big texture.

432
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,700
Atlas yeah but you can look up into or something.

433
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,100
Yeah.

434
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,900
And then you want some metadata.

435
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
That tells you where everything was

436
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
Was, and that's exactly what I did.

437
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
So with.

438
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,800
So and you can't just like, you can't just pass that to see.

439
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,000
You actually have to use the JSF, I'll stuff to rearrange.

440
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,800
This is what I did everything, the Edward draw, it goes into the

441
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,600
library, I would take and the JSF Al creates a new Flash document, it

442
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,500
then takes everything out of the library and places it on the stage,

443
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,900
then it rotates and moves stuff so that they all fit into the smallest

444
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,800
texture possible.

445
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,700
Okay.

446
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,100
Then I have all of the positions recorded that goes into an index

447
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,700
file.

448
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
Boom, that's my texture Atlas.

449
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,900
Now I go through each one of the symbols and then I go and take all of

450
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,100
the animation data, like sound calls everything and I have that in a

451
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,500
separate file that gets piped out and then written to a file.

452
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,000
So in meatboy, there were am files.

453
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,300
That was all the animation data there ITX which was the texture.

454
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,500
Atlas index stuff.

455
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:26,800
Okay.

456
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,600
And then there was just the PNG

457
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
So, every animation, every art asset.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,100
Is those three things?

459
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
Like all the cutscenes everything go in there.

460
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:35,900
Yeah.

461
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,900
So, and that was an exporter that would run in the IDE, which was

462
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,500
super inefficient for.

463
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,700
It was great for like, level stuff, but cutscenes, it would take

464
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,100
forever.

465
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,000
Because it's literally, the IDE is like, okay, put this here, put this

466
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,700
year export This and like the and that's running in interpreted

467
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,200
JavaScript.

468
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,700
Yeah, it's like the slowest pop.

469
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,800
It's the slowest possible thing doing.

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,500
The most possible work right?

471
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,900
Yeah, okay.

472
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,700
And so yeah, that's how everything like the very end cinematic would

473
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,600
take about 14 minutes to export which was a pain in the ass.

474
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I feel like that's almost time to compile maybe a few of the files

475
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,500
from the Unreal Engine.

476
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Yeah basically.

477
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:16,900
Yeah.

478
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Just a few not too many.

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,400
So here's a question for you, your you said that when you when you're

480
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,600
putting out these, you're making your texture Atlas.

481
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Yeah you actually sort of suggests you're jittering.

482
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,500
Them to get a tighter packing than if they were just rectangles.

483
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,000
Basically.

484
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah, I would and I would only do 90 degree because that's what you're

485
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,900
trying to do more than this is the 73 degree angle.

486
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,500
I got ya know you don't want to do that but also I don't think that

487
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,500
would be very efficient so did you feel was what again was that

488
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
something that you?

489
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,600
Why did you feel like you need to do that right?

490
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,700
Did you tell did you use just the standard rectangle kind of packing?

491
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,100
Why did you feel like you needed better packing?

492
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,600
This is like, I just want it or was there a time when you were like,

493
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:58,800
no?

494
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
This isn't working because we have to

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,600
SSO.

496
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm a sick person and based on the drawing, based on the drawing well

497
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,000
that you can't prove.

498
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,700
That was no, we can't.

499
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,400
You can't prove that.

500
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,400
I think it was streamed.

501
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah, so when a but like the first one I did use.

502
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:14,900
Yeah.

503
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
All these little rectangles.

504
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,400
I'm like that's cool but there's a lot of white space and I'm like I

505
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,000
can definitely in my head because at my learning station job, I made a

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
calendar program.

507
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,800
Okay, that you could cut like have

508
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
Have little appointments and it would fill them in and Lego them

509
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,900
together and I'm like I can just do that again and make it all like

510
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,000
smash together and as efficient as possible.

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,500
And yeah, we didn't really need it, but it was fun to do and it worked

512
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,200
out.

513
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,300
So yeah, that was kind of why I was like okay well we definitely need

514
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:57,100
to be able to move this like 90 degree 90 degrees puzzle, Tetris them

515
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,800
all into this thing so that was purely just to set.

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,100
By your own OCD.

517
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,000
Oh, yeah, no, I supposed face is driving me nuts.

518
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,000
I posted pictures of it because I was super proud of it, because it

519
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,300
looks like it looks like it's definitely a computer, did it?

520
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
And that's what looks so cool about.

521
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,400
So, let's, let's jump a little bit forward in that process.

522
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,300
Then so after we've got all this stuff exported and we have you

523
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,300
noticed these sort of files that ink that encode whatever The Flash

524
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:23,900
animation.

525
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah.

526
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,100
Mark up for the texture.

527
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
Atlas we've got that.

528
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,100
So now, you know, we've got to build a game.

529
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,300
Yeah.

530
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,800
Right.

531
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,200
And so Flash doesn't really allow us to probably do enough stuff that

532
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,100
we need to do for that.

533
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,000
So you said, you bought the letter itself, talk about how did you guys

534
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
figure out how that piece was going to work?

535
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Like, how did you figure out how you're going to like assemble the

536
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
game out of flash pieces?

537
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,000
Because there's always a bunch of things?

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
Like how much do we do in the the in Flash versus how much do we do in

539
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,500
the level editor?

540
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,200
Like yeah.

541
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Was that an iterative process?

542
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,500
Give me a little bit of just of the overcrowding that go and was it

543
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,600
just we did the first thing and we just use it or did we have to

544
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,000
iterate?

545
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,700
Like how did that go?

546
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,900
It was actually kind of, we did the first thing in the news did.

547
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,800
So what?

548
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Ben was in my thinking.

549
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,600
I was like Ed's going to do all the animations in Flash, everything

550
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,700
animation, why's everything, cutscene everything menu that's going to

551
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,100
be somehow in Flash and I'm going to hook all that stuff to my engine

552
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,600
code.

553
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,800
So when it came to like the level editor, I wrote The Fly.

554
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,100
I wrote a basic tile editor.

555
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,200
First, you know, click here.

556
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,700
Here's a tile.

557
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,300
Blah, blah, blah.

558
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:22,700
Okay.

559
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
At that point that's like done, you know, that's your Collision.

560
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,500
That's the, because the tiles themselves were just

561
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,500
Geez that had made and okay.

562
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,000
Photoshop.

563
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,100
That was the only thing use Photoshop for was just making the little

564
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,900
Arc for the tiles and then actually strictly tiles.

565
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,000
Are they always little square?

566
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah they're always a little swell.

567
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,200
There's little square little triangles and stuff.

568
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,400
A little tiny Square, the international, the international symbol, for

569
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,500
the whole triangle.

570
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,200
But yeah we had all those little shapes and I made the editor to just

571
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,200
be able to place shapes and have a collision and have basically a PNG

572
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
of meat boy, just Bop around.

573
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,400
Then I made the animation stuff.

574
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
The animation exporter.

575
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,200
And then, I spent some time making sure that integrated n because

576
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,900
everything was from flash.

577
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,000
So, like the saw is the saws were animated in Flash to spin around

578
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,300
because at animated him and flashed spin around.

579
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,100
So they might as well, spend around the same way that he animates him

580
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
in Flash and the editor.

581
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,600
So, everything outside of tiles and was Flash with the exception of

582
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,800
the editor, had a way to do, wait,

583
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,500
Points.

584
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,600
So like if you had like a missile turret, you wanted to move up here

585
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,200
and here he couldn't do that in Flash.

586
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,400
But you know, you could say here and this time be here at this time be

587
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,200
here and then loop back.

588
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,000
So that was the only like animation stuff that was in the editor,

589
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,200
which a lot of people with the super Meet World stuff, made some

590
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,300
pretty crude stuff with that, which is pretty funny.

591
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,600
So, what do like when you say, Collision?

592
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Mmm, so you've got two different types of things in there.

593
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,300
You got the flash objects.

594
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,500
Yeah.

595
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,300
And you've got the PNG is coming fridge with our tiles.

596
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, right.

597
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,000
Is that just like are you doing?

598
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,400
How are you doing?

599
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Cuz there is a tiles just like a solid rectangle Collision or is it

600
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,900
like actually the bitmap Collision or like what did and objects?

601
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,700
What was the Collision there?

602
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,800
Like how did that stuff?

603
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,600
So the collision and the Flash objects I made?

604
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,300
I had in all of EDS libraries, I had bounding Circle and bounding

605
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,700
square and if he would put those in what the editor or was it the

606
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,100
editor?

607
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,800
The exporter one of them would basically Market as this is abounding

608
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
square and it's it would use the width.

609
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,600
Of the containing movie clip as the, you know, the diameter of the

610
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
circle or the width of the square.

611
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
So like if I okay, it would be a circle.

612
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,600
Actually, place the square in the circle.

613
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,100
He just said this is no, no, he placed them and then and then would

614
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,600
move them to the correct.

615
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,100
And then the engine would take those and be like, oh well, don't

616
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,100
render this and make a bounding Circle there and tie it to this.

617
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,600
Okay?

618
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
So and then that gave him the power to be like, oh this, you know,

619
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,900
this saw it's a little too big or

620
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,500
Something.

621
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,900
I'm like, well, fix it.

622
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,600
I don't care if you fix it, like, you shrink it, I don't need to

623
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,100
shrink it.

624
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,600
So and that that offloaded, you know, the little nitpicky work on him

625
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,400
because he can change it easier and faster and test it than I can

626
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,000
change it.

627
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,600
Give it to him.

628
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Test it, you know, that we just cut out the middleman there and let

629
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,300
him place all of that kind of.

630
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,200
So he only because your meat boy is basically squares and circles,

631
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,800
squares, and circles for the objects and then tiles, just your basic

632
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
tile Collision

633
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Tiles are like they're always a rectangle.

634
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah they're a rectangle or whatever the tile shape is so they're

635
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,700
rectangle like half rectangle or there was a because it was you have

636
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,900
the tile which is the image and then you have the actual model which

637
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,600
is either the square or the triangle and then from there then it would

638
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,300
it would treat it as a triangle and as we actually have the underlying

639
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:50,900
shapes.

640
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,400
Yeah that would then.

641
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,000
And so then all these things come into possession session and then

642
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,300
they just flow through naturally.

643
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,600
Yahweh and the editor is basically a thing either.

644
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
It came from Flash and was marked up there, or the editor said,

645
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,500
This tile is a triangle shape.

646
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,700
Ya, I got ya.

647
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,200
So, how did you deal with?

648
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,900
Like the, you know, I guess the binding between these things.

649
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,300
So you have all these flash files and that sort of stuff.

650
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,100
And I want to make one of these like, you know, like you said, the

651
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
sort of the spinning saw blade or yeah.

652
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
And I want to put that in there.

653
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
So what does that look like for Edmund?

654
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,100
You know he's doing a level or something like that, like how?

655
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,400
Yeah.

656
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,200
And what's the iteration?

657
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,100
Like as you said like you had to go back to flash, maybe change a

658
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,000
collision sizes.

659
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,500
Like how did, how did all that work out?

660
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,800
So it was a good was it was a trick, you know, know that actually

661
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,900
Worked out pretty well because that was a because you had, you know,

662
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,600
you have the forest, you have the hospital to have the Salt Factory.

663
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,300
Each one of those was a set of like a flash file, for our flash file,

664
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,000
for all the objects, flash file, for all the like set pieces that have

665
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,400
like, your trees, your waterfalls flash file for little animals, like

666
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,500
the squirrels and stuff.

667
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,800
So, all those would be placed in a file.

668
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I just called a pallet and he would, it would be like, oh object is

669
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,500
this Diane file?

670
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,100
Okay, set pieces this and it kind of went down through all that.

671
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,700
So all he would do bird.

672
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,000
The am file name.

673
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
Like the file name?

674
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,600
Yeah.

675
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Is it would just load that.

676
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Yeah, it would just load that and because he would like in the editor

677
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,000
who would be like, all right, I want to make a forest level.

678
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,700
So he would load up Forest dot LP which was level palette.

679
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
He would load that up, that would take and grab his objects.

680
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,400
His tile sheet, his basically everything he would need for that level.

681
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,200
So then, like if he did have to go back and change a saw, adjuster if

682
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,300
you wanted to add a set-piece, he would go to like set piece the FAA,

683
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,600
put it in re-export, then he would just load up the levels scroll

684
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,800
through and there's his new thing and is that like wait so did the

685
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,600
files ever contain more than one placeable object at a time then?

686
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,100
The meaning.

687
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,800
Meaning like so I have these flash files and they're coming up in this

688
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,400
palette.

689
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,500
Oh, I reach into the flash file export, the exported flash file, huh?

690
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,400
Do I reach in there and grab out a particular element of it?

691
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,600
So that there's like a double binding?

692
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,900
There's the we have to remember.

693
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,100
Like okay, there's a file name that it corresponds to and like a sub

694
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,800
name inside.

695
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,100
Yeah.

696
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,600
How is based on an ID?

697
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,500
So okay.

698
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,700
So if he was and it was all done with mouse wheel so he would have

699
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,000
like a like he would go through the steps.

700
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,100
He would just like, scroll through those would have unique IDs, place

701
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,300
them and they were according to how they were layered in the FL a

702
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,600
file.

703
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,400
So, he would have to place new stuff at the top, so that.

704
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,300
Yeah, and that worked out well.

705
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,600
Like, when the index of his mess up, I he was a it's not working on

706
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
me, you place it at the top he's like, no way.

707
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah.

708
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,800
And then I got he would place it at the top and then re-export and it

709
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,100
would be fine because the level the actual level files had all the

710
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
indexes in there.

711
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,400
I see.

712
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
And then it would just like load the index.

713
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
Is from the animation thing, okay?

714
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,500
So it's straight up like a file name.

715
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,800
Plus a number five,

716
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,300
Plus a number equal better, line up Edmund.

717
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

718
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Yeah, because he had two different, you had the animation file, which

719
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,300
had the IDS of the animations and you had the index file.

720
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,800
So if he because I made it, so he could do either a full export, which

721
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800
would take forever or just a texture export.

722
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,100
So if he wanted to change how this tree looked, instead of exporting,

723
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,900
everything he could just export the texture.

724
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,800
But if you exported the texture and not the animation file happened to

725
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
add something that

726
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,900
Everything is just wrong.

727
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,800
This caused a lot of problems and development.

728
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm not that bad.

729
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,200
No, no, like one or two times, I mean he's like oh because it was easy

730
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,000
because it was all in the flash ID form he would just literally like

731
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
it was in the drop-down for commands in Flash so he would just done

732
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:47,900
done.

733
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay.

734
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,400
So yeah, I made it may be pretty easy on him so let's I'm all that

735
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,300
stuff is caveman stuff now compared to what I have.

736
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,000
Okay.

737
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,400
So

738
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah, what I made me so okay.

739
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,900
So so you felt like that was not that was stupid.

740
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,300
I hated the exporter so much.

741
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,900
All right.

742
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,600
So what did you change?

743
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,300
I made it just read swf files like it, renders vectored, swf files

744
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,200
animations reads.

745
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,300
All of the sounds from the swf files.

746
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,500
So all you have is an swf file.

747
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,000
So what did you do?

748
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,000
Like, did you?

749
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,700
I always things that, are you go get like a flash, I downloaded the,

750
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,400
The Flash, the swf file,

751
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,400
Spec from Adobe and I read it.

752
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
No, yes, that's what I did.

753
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,300
That's right.

754
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,300
And yeah.

755
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,900
And that was super fun because now I can make anything like it's so

756
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,400
it's so insane because it went from God, we got it spin like 14

757
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
minutes exporting this to.

758
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Oh, well just here's the swf and it just renders and it's fine.

759
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,400
And it's all like,

760
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,600
Like, it's all Vector, so it can be any size, any, you know?

761
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,300
It's great.

762
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,800
So, I guess let me ask the question.

763
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
That's kind of interesting about interested about how you're doing the

764
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,000
layout before.

765
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,900
So, now that you've moved to an swf file, you're reading it directly

766
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:11,800
again.

767
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,500
How do you deal with the whole?

768
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,200
Like, I've got these in-game tools.

769
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,500
They need to reference the stuff from the swf and the artist just, you

770
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,300
know, output it a bunch of swf files.

771
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,200
How are you doing that?

772
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,100
Binding of you change.

773
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,900
The way you're doing, it is still named an index.

774
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,300
It's so now what it is is now instead of a level palette and

775
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,300
All those things.

776
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,400
Now, it's just the swf and inside the swf, you have Clips on the main

777
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,800
stage.

778
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,500
So you have a clip called set pieces.

779
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,800
You have a clip called objects, you have a clip called Parallax.

780
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,200
And what it does with the editor does, is it takes the swf looks for

781
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
those specific things and then just makes a big giant database and

782
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,100
then you have your indices to like, if this is a set piece, you know,

783
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,300
you you hit this movie clip and then you render this index from inside

784
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
that the Sip

785
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:58,900
Peace.

786
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Hold on in

787
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,700
The set piece.

788
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,600
There's a drawing.

789
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,700
Yeah, the draw inside the set piece.

790
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,100
Yeah.

791
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,200
Also draw this guy.

792
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,900
And if you push down that one, you can scroll, okay?

793
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,000
So if you need more space.

794
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,400
Yeah, you do.

795
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,900
My draw, a dick like immediately.

796
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,100
So let's say we like the degree of lewd drawings that we're going to

797
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,000
happen on handmade here.

798
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
I guess we just get them all out, right?

799
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,600
You were in yours.

800
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,600
You weren't at my wedding, my wedding, our guest book was draw your

801
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
best dick.

802
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
And there are some amazing ones there.

803
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
You probably had a lot of good artists.

804
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,700
Yeah.

805
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,200
Oh yeah.

806
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,700
Yeah.

807
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,100
Okay.

808
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Ben that's going to be that's going to be like a collect.

809
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,400
That's gonna be the Smithsonian someday.

810
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,700
Yeah.

811
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,100
No.

812
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,000
I certainly hope so.

813
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,500
You know, collection after the bombs, drop addicted.

814
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah.

815
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,900
After all, the bombs dropped, and we're going through the Commonwealth

816
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,900
and there's like, they go into this thing and there's just this, this

817
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,400
in this house.

818
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,600
There's just picture of these two dicks kissing.

819
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,400
Yeah, we can rebuild Society.

820
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Now we know what, we know what, we know what it was like before the

821
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,200
bombs.

822
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,700
All right?

823
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,000
Yeah.

824
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,900
So

825
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,400
You can see why I'm not an artist because that's the best Square.

826
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,800
I can make it's beautiful.

827
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,300
Yeah.

828
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,500
So let's say, oh boy,

829
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,400
Why is it?

830
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,000
It's no, it's that this this button.

831
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,699
Oh, that's me, I'm like, fat fingering it.

832
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,500
We got it.

833
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,600
We got to work on your art skills.

834
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,300
Many, gotta know how to use a Wacom tablet.

835
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Okay, I didn't mean to draw a face that I did.

836
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:30,100
So let's say this is, this is that so, for obstacle, I'm still drawing

837
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:30,500
a face.

838
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,300
This is, this is S4 set pieces and this is P for Parallax.

839
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,400
Now, this is our swf

840
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,300
Okay, okay, that loads into the engine, through this little arrow

841
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:45,800
here.

842
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,100
Okay, in what Universe was that an era?

843
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,800
I don't know.

844
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
I can't, it's weird.

845
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,800
I needed to be flat.

846
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,500
Like hello.

847
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,400
We are the beings that only have lots of, so that gets that gets

848
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,700
loaded.

849
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,300
Wonderful.

850
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Yeah, I know this is great, so that gets loaded in and basically, if

851
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,100
you want to think about these as these are all little databases

852
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,200
Okay, and each one inside of each.

853
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,400
What are they keyed on each end inside of each one?

854
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,500
If you look in the FL a that you have your layers of for people that

855
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,700
are familiar with flash and like this would be like a tree like the

856
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,200
just that but man you just can't push the button tree but let's say

857
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,100
you have Tree in this and that those are just like it doesn't base it

858
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,400
off names or anything it's literally based off where it is in the like

859
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,800
Drawing hierarchy in the foia file.

860
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,000
So if the tree is at the very top, that's like that's like the last

861
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,300
index.

862
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,800
The very bottom is 0, and this is n.

863
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,200
Okay?

864
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,600
Okay, so and this is literally just the draw order.

865
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,000
Meaning, what they set up as like the overlap.

866
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,300
Yeah.

867
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah because if you're doing, if you're doing

868
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,500
Flash correctly and you don't have everything all piled on one layer.

869
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay, you have everything on separate layers and that, that naturally

870
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
just forms a database.

871
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,800
So that's kind of the structure of, let's say Parallax or whatever.

872
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,800
And then when the engine loads in this clip and we say Parallax you

873
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,700
mean the background, we had like little little background things that

874
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,800
you can and it doesn't matter because it's z-axis.

875
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,600
Okay, I know 2D people are afraid of Z axis but it's helpful.

876
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,100
Okay?

877
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:29,800
So

878
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,100
So when you, when you load those in at the engine just basically goes

879
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,400
through and it's just loads all of these clips because it doesn't care

880
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,000
and it doesn't know what's on the layers.

881
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,500
It just knows this is, this is I, this is child one in Parallax that

882
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,300
this is child to Child 3 child for.

883
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,300
So inside the engine, when I load in this Parallax thing I go okay

884
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,100
these are all my Parallax things.

885
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,900
This is these are there their indices.

886
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,900
So and actually, I don't even load the things themselves because they

887
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
load when they're only.

888
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,500
Needed.

889
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,400
So there's on-demand.

890
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah so when when the when the level of like you basically Parts like

891
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,300
the header of it or something, I parse?

892
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,400
Yeah of course everything because in the engine that's how the swf

893
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,000
files work is, I don't want to actively tessellate everything right

894
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,700
then and there, because the tessellations so quick, I can do it at

895
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,300
load time and nobody knows because it's just there.

896
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,600
So when I go through and I load these, I have like just an internal

897
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,200
database and when, when he scrolling through the mouse or when the

898
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,800
artist is scroll,

899
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Through the mouse and they like, see a little Parallax they want and

900
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,000
they place it then the level.

901
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
That's a level good love.

902
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,200
Ya know.

903
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,100
It's really a girl.

904
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,000
Decorate.

905
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,400
It like that.

906
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,400
That's what Cliff.

907
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,000
There's a tree.

908
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,200
Yeah.

909
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,900
So when he clicks and places this tree right here, like that's let's,

910
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,300
let's just say that's that's number 0, and it also has a sub ID

911
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,300
because it needs to tell it that it's a lack.

912
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,800
So it's got a sub idealist, a parallax is 3 because I actually think

913
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,500
Is 3.

914
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
So now those are hard coded in the engine.

915
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,700
I assume like parallaxes 3.

916
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:04,900
Yeah.

917
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,000
Parallax is 3.

918
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,500
This one.

919
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,300
Those are by name in the swf.

920
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,500
So meaning the engine first looks at the swf.

921
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,100
Yeah engine look, here's my my obstacle layers.

922
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,300
My, what do you what do you say?

923
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,600
The S?

924
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,200
Was that set pieces?

925
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,000
Like I, let me see my set-piece clip my object clip, and my Parallax

926
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,200
click.

927
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,500
OK.

928
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,400
And then everything inside those clips are all the objects, all the

929
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,000
Parallax, all everything got it.

930
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,800
And so does this, this would then have the same problem.

931
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,800
You just need one words, if they change the order of things yet in

932
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,600
that folder.

933
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,100
So you're still going to tell Edmund.

934
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
He got to be that the top.

935
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,600
Yeah.

936
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,300
However, because it doesn't take 14 minutes, he just moves it and hits

937
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,000
publish and then two seconds later.

938
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,700
He he has so rude.

939
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,200
Why aren't those by name instead of by number?

940
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Is it because the names the artist don't want to set names?

941
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,300
Or what was like?

942
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,400
Like, tell me a little bit because you you went by name for, you know,

943
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,000
for for this guy up here, my thinking is yeah.

944
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,800
But this guy down.

945
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,300
Not my thinking is because these are all hard-coded into the engine.

946
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,000
You're not going to have anything extra because these are going to be

947
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,300
your objects, your set-pieces your Parallax, you're special okay like

948
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,900
bandage girl or your Band-Aids or stuff like that.

949
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,700
You're only going to have these set things and these are going to be

950
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,800
things that I actively want to see because it's not an editor like

951
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Unity where he can actively go.

952
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,200
I want to load in sunshine clip and then sunshine clip comes in and

953
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,500
that's a whole different thing because the levels are themselves are

954
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,800
structured like any level.

955
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,100
For any Tile game, you're going to have tiles, you're going to have

956
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,500
okay?

957
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,000
You know obstacles you can have enemies like those are all the things

958
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,900
you're going to have and then adding those actually to the editor is

959
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,800
just as easy as like, okay look for this clip, this is this clip, this

960
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,800
is the sub ID when you and then with the editor now you can bind a

961
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,600
button to mode and then be able to place whatever you want.

962
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,900
So it's like the thinking was these are always going to remain static.

963
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
These are always going to be

964
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
And them because they're not.

965
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,600
He's going to like add 10 different trees or five Ministries like him,

966
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,000
naming them, 30 31.

967
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,600
32 wouldn't do any good because I say well have to go through and like

968
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,900
I would actually have to know the names at that point, because I run

969
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,800
everything based on numbers, like little like the indexes and

970
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,100
everything and it makes more sense for me to just go.

971
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,600
Okay, here.

972
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,600
This, this tree, I don't care that it's a tree.

973
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,700
I just care that it's

974
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:35,200
Index zero for clip or clip database three well.

975
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
So I'm assuming though I'm just and sorry to belabor this because I'm

976
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
curious now cool.

977
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,500
So I am assuming that here, you know, we could draw a way better

978
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,100
squares of - I'm classically trained.

979
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I went to square school.

980
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
I went to this, I'm sorry.

981
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,900
I went to the square Conservatory.

982
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,400
Wow, where we studied we Square studied squares.

983
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

984
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,000
My hit.

985
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,400
My hands to shake a little bit because there's very strict teachers.

986
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,600
So I we could introduce here like you know, if this if this is our swf

987
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,200
file right we could introduce a table here that's like okay, the last

988
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,000
time is imported this thing like index 0 was like the tree or

989
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,800
something and index one was whatever and it stores the string, right?

990
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,100
Yeah.

991
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,000
And so then the next time you load it in it would look at the names

992
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,100
and go oh tree moved.

993
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,600
It's like it's down here now, but I find it and I remapped it.

994
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,600
But you, you don't seem interested.

995
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,800
Even I would say in these strings and so I

996
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,000
Just want to just know specifically like do you think it's just not

997
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,800
worth the time?

998
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,100
Do you think the a just don't name them anyway or?

999
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,700
Well, that's how does that, that's the thing.

1000
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,800
So I never thought of it as like I want them to name because the the

1001
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,900
Integrity of this database needs to always be consistent because it

1002
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,300
doesn't because it's easy to fix, okay?

1003
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,100
So, and, and with flashes being able because it's literally like out

1004
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,100
of trees here, and it's supposed to be there, you just drag and drop

1005
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,400
publish done, okay?

1006
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,800
And for me to do this,

1007
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,800
Part that introduces like a level of complexity where it's like, okay,

1008
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,600
well now for some reason trees up here and this was Zero, but it was

1009
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,700
this back before and it just okay.

1010
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,800
That's really interesting.

1011
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,200
Yeah.

1012
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,500
So for me, it's just like, I don't care what's in here as long as I

1013
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,200
give it to the artist and if he's like, I want to add a billion things

1014
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,300
and if he knows to Adam at the top, he can add a billion things in

1015
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,700
like 20 minutes and then they're just in the editor.

1016
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Whereas if he had to go through a name them and all this stuff then

1017
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
it's like and then yeah artists don't name it.

1018
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,300
At least Ed doesn't he would name stuff and it was so irritating and

1019
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:34,700
Meat Boy.

1020
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,100
He would name stuff, xxxxx xxxxx one, well, that's to the and that was

1021
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,300
a tree but that's how you know, the difference between that and XXX

1022
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,000
XXXX.

1023
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,100
Yeah.

1024
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,800
And then and then e, then it was it was an ex anymore.

1025
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
It was that was the name of it and I'm like, this is useless, this is

1026
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,900
totally useless.

1027
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,500
So like to take like it doesn't need to have a name because it's just

1028
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,800
it's these things and

1029
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,400
Like when you think about the end end product, if you want to say

1030
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,500
yeah, the in product of this level, that's always going to be a tree

1031
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,700
until he goes into the editor and change it I guess or unless he

1032
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,300
messes up the order here.

1033
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,700
But is it messed up the ordering fixes super quick.

1034
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,900
So, would one way to state that be like, you come down on the side of

1035
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,300
look, they either have to get a bunch of names.

1036
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah.

1037
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,500
Collide with each other or they have to keep the indices in order.

1038
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
I don't really think there's a bonus to this one.

1039
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,800
So why not remove that from the prop?

1040
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,300
Basically yeah because they're all going to be in order.

1041
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,500
So I actually yeah I actually think it's easier to just be like the

1042
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
rule be at the top at the top.

1043
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:39,900
Yeah.

1044
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,900
You know instead of name it name.

1045
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,400
Yeah.

1046
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,300
That's really fascinating.

1047
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,700
Actually.

1048
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,900
And it made me feel like it works.

1049
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah.

1050
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:46,800
I like it.

1051
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,100
All right, so I think that's, that's pretty good for our pipeline

1052
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,500
stuff.

1053
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:50,900
Okay.

1054
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,000
That that was actually really interesting, but I wanted to talk a

1055
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,600
little bit about the controller stuff and so I'm just keeping an eye

1056
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,200
on time here.

1057
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,800
So I think I wanted to switch over to that if that's cool.

1058
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,800
Yeah, so I want to talk about the control stuff for Super Meat, Boy, a

1059
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,400
because it's like way far out of anything I ever do.

1060
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,200
Like I've never worked on controller code for, you know, for an action

1061
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,800
game or anything like that.

1062
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,200
Yeah.

1063
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,600
And also because you know, it's pretty universally accepted as a very

1064
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,100
good example, of doing the controls, right?

1065
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,800
And so I kind of wanted to get like, you know, just start off with

1066
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,300
what was the process like for doing that, right?

1067
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,600
Like, did you was it where the controls great from day one?

1068
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,800
Did you iterate constantly?

1069
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,500
Was there playtesting?

1070
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:29,800
Like if

1071
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,100
Me a little overview before I start asking questions at the actual.

1072
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,200
So, the way, the way I approach is, I'm very bitchy OG when it comes

1073
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,000
to controls.

1074
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,500
I hate bad controls.

1075
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,500
They ruin everything, okay?

1076
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,100
It's terrible.

1077
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,600
So before I made art Pipeline, and after I made playstyles, okay, I

1078
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,300
worked on movement.

1079
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,900
And the way I did that is, I knew because the flash version does not

1080
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,100
have good controls, and I would I threw that.

1081
00:44:59,100 --> 00:44:59,800
I didn't look at it.

1082
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,700
Me that out.

1083
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,100
Okay, I knew he had to jump and while jump and that's what I that's

1084
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,800
what I went by.

1085
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:11,400
So for about three months because that was the first controller game I

1086
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,000
made to.

1087
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,100
I didn't do anything and hoop world for controls.

1088
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,700
Goo was just basically a mouse game that was the first time like good,

1089
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,200
good control.

1090
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,700
Actually, you could use a controller and go but it was like it was

1091
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,000
different.

1092
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,400
You just move a thing around, you know, you're not actively.

1093
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,900
Yeah, so what I, what I did for that.

1094
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,700
That was I made, I made a simple tile editor, level editor thing,

1095
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,900
where I could just Place some tiles and my little Meat Boy Square

1096
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,100
because he was still just a square.

1097
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,400
At that point, the little red square could just run around and like

1098
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,300
wall jump and stuff.

1099
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,700
And what I did for about three months is I tweaked it and the way I

1100
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,800
tweaked it was, I would play through it and I would make specific

1101
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,300
situations where it would be.

1102
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,500
This is a one tile block and this is a one tile block.

1103
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,900
I want to be able to wall jump from this.

1104
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,700
Tile block and land on top of this block got it.

1105
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,800
So what I, what I did and it was two prongs, so it was a lot of

1106
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,200
iteration.

1107
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,600
But I also made there are no physics formulas in me boy, it's called

1108
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,500
just garbage, so it's completely hand coated, every formula.

1109
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,300
I mean, there's gravity, right?

1110
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,300
But there's this thing called air friction, okay?

1111
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,300
You know, there's real friction in the air.

1112
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,100
Yeah, but are looks like there's your stairs are turn, friction.

1113
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,400
They haven't found all the fundamental.

1114
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,800
That's the truth, Sarah, you do.

1115
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,300
No.

1116
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,300
What could this is high-level Quantum shit.

1117
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,100
We're talking about.

1118
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:39,600
Okay, so I had all these variables because like, as I was playing

1119
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,700
through and this is how like a thing like air friction would come up,

1120
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,800
it would be like, okay, I can jump, but I don't like how if I want to

1121
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,100
go back this way if I'm just doing it Force base and I'm just going

1122
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,500
like oh just add to the force just until he goes back.

1123
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,300
I don't like that.

1124
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,500
So I would be like well, I want like a multiplier.

1125
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,800
If I'm going back this way in the air.

1126
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,400
And that became air friction.

1127
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,200
And then I made a form like in game where I could change values in

1128
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,100
game and then test it.

1129
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,200
So Meat Boy is a common, a like Meat.

1130
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,200
Boy, controls are a combination of garbage formulas.

1131
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,600
Okay, that don't make any physical sense, okay.

1132
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:20,700
And garbage variables that have no bearing in reality, okay?

1133
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,400
So it's just knobs.

1134
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,400
So in some sense, the process was create an obstacle course.

1135
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,100
Yes, right.

1136
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,900
In other words, various obstacles are able to do

1137
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, well yeah.

1138
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,600
Right.

1139
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,700
And then sort of start with some formulas because I guess you met.

1140
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,500
So how did you pick the initial set?

1141
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,800
I mean, you just like because this is an iterative process.

1142
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,600
Yeah somewhere.

1143
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:40,800
Yeah.

1144
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,100
It was a, it was just, you know, velocity, he runs jumps and then

1145
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,700
gravity.

1146
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,900
And then, you know, run you don't really have to change run, you just

1147
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,200
change the speed run but it was all about like jump and air control

1148
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,600
was the, the crazy thing.

1149
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Let's change the speed to run.

1150
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,900
I mean it's got some acceleration.

1151
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,800
Like Meat Boy, doesn't immediately he has I think he has to

1152
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,600
I was like, it's insane.

1153
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,500
Because okay.

1154
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,200
And I remember, I actually remember that during the process.

1155
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,900
I'm like, if there's a saw firing down at me, I need to get out of the

1156
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,100
way.

1157
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,700
I don't want to.

1158
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,000
And since he's got air friction and all this crap, why can't he just

1159
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,300
instantly coloring?

1160
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,300
So that was, that was kind of how that went.

1161
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,100
It was just, it was just like have some basic movement and then, like

1162
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,400
you said, like obstacle course and everything and with that sort of

1163
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,700
iteration it made,

1164
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,400
Once once those controls got like perfect where I can make basically

1165
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,400
anything I wanted and and in some way like figure out how to get up

1166
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,600
there or over there once I could do that then was like these are the

1167
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,000
controls that took about three months.

1168
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,300
That's an impressively.

1169
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,300
Like that's a I guess I say is looking at the final game.

1170
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,900
Yeah, that's kind of interesting to hear because that to get to those

1171
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,200
controls, you really did have to do the work.

1172
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:55,800
Like it was nothing.

1173
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Like, I don't know that.

1174
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,400
Well, I mean it was it was a lot of like dartboard.

1175
00:48:59,400 --> 00:48:59,800
Yeah.

1176
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,100
In like oh cool.

1177
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,200
Yeah because I don't know what the units for are tourney friction

1178
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:05,900
right, right.

1179
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,200
Yeah.

1180
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,500
From for meat.

1181
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,100
What's the meat are tearing friction?

1182
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,700
Yeah.

1183
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,400
So I don't know the units for that but with the interesting part of

1184
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,600
that though, was once those controls got in place and Ed started

1185
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,400
building levels, we found more stuff we could do through the levels of

1186
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,400
like there's something called an S jump.

1187
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,600
And the way the S jump works is really kind of crazy because you can

1188
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,800
jump and do this and actually

1189
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:33,800
we get slightly higher than if you were to jump and do that.

1190
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:40,300
Okay but it feels correct because of how weird you control in the air.

1191
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,700
Okay.

1192
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:45,400
So you can s jump and go into these little tiny crevice things where

1193
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,100
you couldn't possibly go over.

1194
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,400
If you were to just wall jump out and that was all attributed to just

1195
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,600
air control, air friction and you didn't tune for the S.

1196
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,300
Jump the estimates, just came in, because you made all these weird

1197
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:56,900
formulas.

1198
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,800
There are certain like holes like are definitely holes but like

1199
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,900
Optimal places in the formulas where if you just do the right thing?

1200
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,600
Yeah I think you can get a little extra.

1201
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,300
You can you can like you can like maneuver into these things.

1202
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,600
Yeah.

1203
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,100
Okay.

1204
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,300
Yeah.

1205
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:14,000
And that's and those those became like super special and they they are

1206
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,500
totally wrong, but they feel super correct because of how everything

1207
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
sort of flows anything there.

1208
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,900
It's not oh coded.

1209
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,100
So you can do an estimate because that would be a very this thing.

1210
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,500
It's a, you know, it's more natural and because of that, it feels it

1211
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:29,800
just

1212
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,500
Feels like it is part of the controls like it was meant to be that way

1213
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,900
and so how like what are what's an example?

1214
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,300
And it's probably something that's hard to remember exactly what it

1215
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:38,500
was.

1216
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,900
But like so the fundamental quantities that you're tracking from frame

1217
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,600
to frame for the control scheme, what do those look like?

1218
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:44,800
Right?

1219
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,600
Like you know, you said velocity position?

1220
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,200
Are there more like are there things, you know and how are you looking

1221
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,700
at the stick?

1222
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,200
Like what's the what does the the sort of like State?

1223
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,000
The input space?

1224
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,200
Look, like, kind of as we're going.

1225
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,100
As we're going through this?

1226
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,400
Yeah.

1227
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,600
Well trying to.

1228
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,800
So I don't remember exactly.

1229
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,900
We like everything that I I know, I like kept the velocity and this

1230
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,200
jump height and everything because there was a thing where if you tap

1231
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,900
jump, he'll jump one tile.

1232
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,300
Even if you let go because it feels weird to jump and only do like

1233
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:14,800
that, right?

1234
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,500
It feels better to jump do like that or if you hold it jump and go

1235
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,900
like that.

1236
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,100
So there's some threshold and there's a jump less than this amount.

1237
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:22,600
Exactly.

1238
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:22,900
Yeah.

1239
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,800
And that made it for it.

1240
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,400
Just feels more consistent that way because your mind and your finger,

1241
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,900
they don't always we always

1242
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,600
He's at the same.

1243
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:36,200
Yeah, same speed as far as like, looking at the controller and

1244
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:36,900
everything.

1245
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,200
Yeah.

1246
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,400
I was just, I don't know.

1247
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,900
Well, this drawings just got a lot better.

1248
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,800
Well, uh, do you - like?

1249
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,800
Yeah, keep talking.

1250
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,200
I'll take a look at just make sure we didn't lose any plugs.

1251
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,000
So yeah.

1252
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,200
As far as like, looking at the controls,

1253
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,600
And I don't even really really no I mean it was such a weird like the

1254
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:06,700
way I built the controls in was a everything in the engine is

1255
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:12,000
abstracted because I come from unreal town, where they abstract, they

1256
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,300
abstract everything like to crazier degree than I do.

1257
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,700
So like when I built the engine, I built something that could be

1258
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,800
ported and like that's that's what it's, that's what I pried it on is

1259
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,400
like I ported I may I pour Danny Boy in a weekend PS3 like

1260
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,300
Okay, you know, that's in it's because of how I structured everything.

1261
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,200
So, like with the controller, it's all, you know, it's X input for

1262
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,500
this.

1263
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,200
It's this video.

1264
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,700
So you have your X input, your excellent put talks to like an input

1265
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,200
layer, which I just recently changed, because I didn't like the name

1266
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,300
of it because that's what you do.

1267
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,000
Just the name.

1268
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,100
Yeah, well, my name was, the only thing I didn't like, I didn't like

1269
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,600
the name and I didn't like how it was set up, so I changed all of it,

1270
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,900
but it's better now.

1271
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,600
So that talks to like the input layer.

1272
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,400
That is like,

1273
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,000
Like that just basically gives you.

1274
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,600
I have a thing in the engine where you can use like the left and right

1275
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,000
stick as d-pads, which is the easiest thing in the world.

1276
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,900
Because it's just, you know, if you're more this way and then this way

1277
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,200
you're going left, if you're more this way, this way you're going up.

1278
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,600
So it's actually digital.

1279
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,900
Yeah, these are the controls for meat by digital.

1280
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,400
Oh yes.

1281
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,500
Okay so actually all of the analog Miss comes from, you know, how long

1282
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,900
you've pushed you never?

1283
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,700
How hard you push?

1284
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,400
Yeah, no no no on every platform.

1285
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,100
Okay yeah, yeah, yeah.

1286
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,800
So what sort of quantities you track their?

1287
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,200
So you've got you it sounds like you've got d-pad in so you've got,

1288
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,900
you've got basically like a directional left right up down left,

1289
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,000
right?

1290
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,400
Yeah, and you've got the buttons.

1291
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,300
Yeah, I got buttons.

1292
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,400
And so at that point at that stage, I guess what?

1293
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,900
I'm trying to ask is from frame to frame our the, you know, you've got

1294
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,600
a bunch of sort of pseudo physics formulas that you've been working on

1295
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,300
that you tweaked.

1296
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:54,900
Yeah, yeah.

1297
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,500
Or is there?

1298
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,900
Carryover Beyond just some quantities, like velocity.

1299
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,300
Position, are there other things that needed to get tracked?

1300
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,200
Like oh, how long has he been holding down the button and we do some

1301
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,500
stuff with.

1302
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,300
Well, there was that.

1303
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,800
How did you remember any interesting things about that though?

1304
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,700
Actually yes, wouldn't be the first thing you'd think of.

1305
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,700
Yeah, that that's actually a really good one.

1306
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,500
And it's the best part, because it's the part nobody realizes, but

1307
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,400
they all do it.

1308
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:20,800
Okay?

1309
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,300
And it was something I discovered during the three months of craziness

1310
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,100
wall, jump has a 200 millisecond leeway.

1311
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,500
Okay.

1312
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,200
Of.

1313
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,800
If you press, if you're on a wall and you press off the wall, it's not

1314
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,900
going to immediately take them off the wall because in your brain when

1315
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,000
you first play Meat Boy, you want to jump off the wall and go the

1316
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,700
direction, okay?

1317
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,800
But a lot of the times you'll either do Direction first, okay?

1318
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,500
Or you'll do it at the same time, okay?

1319
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,600
And if you do it at the same time, he detaches from the wall and then

1320
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,100
he just falls into camera so that 200 milliseconds, makes it so

1321
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,300
anybody can like your, it's long enough that it's like, Oh, I pushed

1322
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,900
to the left and I jump to the

1323
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,400
And it feels right but it's short enough that it's not like I'm trying

1324
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,000
to get off the wall.

1325
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:04,900
I can't get off the wall.

1326
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,000
So he actually sticks to the wall, he doesn't come off the wall, but

1327
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,900
you still allow them to jump for Toonami.

1328
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,300
Actually sticks for 200.

1329
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,100
Yeah, I had a thing like that and I hated it because it felt weird and

1330
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:16,900
it was just bug prone.

1331
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,200
So I'm just like, well, just stick for just a tiny amount of time.

1332
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:20,400
Okay.

1333
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,200
So if you start pushing Off the Wall there's actually like a counter.

1334
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,400
Yeah.

1335
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,700
It's going to start incrementing at that point or decrementing or

1336
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,600
however you did in there.

1337
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,500
Yeah something's going to count up 200 milliseconds over the frames.

1338
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:29,800
Yeah.

1339
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,600
And if you let go, you know, at some point there, he'll just do the

1340
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,100
standard falling or whatever, but if you push the button during that

1341
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,800
time table.

1342
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,300
Yeah.

1343
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,300
And then he jumps up, was there anything else like that?

1344
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,500
Like how about Edge roll off?

1345
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,200
Like as I'm going towards an edge and I'm going to do a jump, do you

1346
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,200
get some time after or exactly never never been a fan of that.

1347
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:47,500
Okay.

1348
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,300
And and no meat boy, doesn't have that.

1349
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,100
I had that in a prototype.

1350
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,200
I was making for a different type of game and I didn't find it all

1351
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:56,800
that useful.

1352
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,200
Oh really?

1353
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:57,600
Like

1354
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,600
I don't know, I don't know if that's in other games, but I always felt

1355
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:07,200
like in meatboy maybe it maybe it has to do more with the game because

1356
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,000
even though there are, you know there's this Gap right here and you in

1357
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,600
order to make the jump you have to literally jump in here.

1358
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,700
But those situations in the game aren't that common?

1359
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,800
Because it's not like a life-or-death thing.

1360
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,400
You can jump and then maybe hit the wall and jump off.

1361
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,900
So you can like compensate for yourself.

1362
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,600
So maybe that's why I never.

1363
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,400
It just wasn't designed to make.

1364
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,000
Right at the edge jumping.

1365
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,200
The.

1366
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,900
Yeah.

1367
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,300
Anything.

1368
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,000
So it wasn't like a Mega Man thing where you have to pixels and either

1369
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,100
you make it or you doubt.

1370
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,200
And because in that thing and that's, you know, with with Mega Man,

1371
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,400
you would jump and you would hit this wall.

1372
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,600
But in meatboy, you hit the wall and then you can just jump off and

1373
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,100
let's jump and go right back on top.

1374
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,200
So I think that's that's why I didn't actually use anything like that

1375
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,200
in there because it just seemed unnecessary.

1376
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,000
So at the end of this three months, you've got, you've got the wall

1377
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,400
sticking.

1378
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
I'm assuming that's part of the three months process.

1379
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,800
Was the Second Waltz.

1380
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,400
That you've got the fake physics formulas reference physics.

1381
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,400
Yeah reference model ref tone.

1382
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,800
Ian Wright.

1383
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,300
Yes tripodi in the dynamic.

1384
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,500
Yeah so we got rough Tony and Dynamics in there.

1385
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,000
How much do those change over?

1386
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,600
The course of the game?

1387
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,700
Did you literally stay with what exactly as it was in the three months

1388
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,500
or was there tuning that happened after as you know, get through the

1389
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,200
game more.

1390
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,700
Well, they stayed that way the entire exactly.

1391
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,900
So and there's basically exactly the same as the end of the three

1392
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,100
months.

1393
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,600
Yeah.

1394
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,800
The the controls, at the end of the

1395
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,300
Three months for the same as the ones that were in the final game.

1396
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,000
And the reason is because at the end of the three months, had started

1397
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,900
making levels and when he started making levels, like the the thing

1398
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,900
that makes Meat Boy.

1399
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,800
Great is the controls compliment, the level design, level design,

1400
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,800
complements the controls.

1401
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,800
Okay, so if the level design was terrible and the controls were good,

1402
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,500
the game would still be terrible if the level design was amazing and

1403
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
the controls was terrible.

1404
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,400
The game would be terrible.

1405
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,700
Okay?

1406
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,400
But because Ed worked in the limitations of those controls, he made

1407
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,800
levels

1408
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,700
Complimented those controls, okay.

1409
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,500
And that's why they never change because to change them would mean to

1410
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,100
effective changes all the other levels because okay.

1411
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:12,200
So basically part of the philosophy for the game almost was that like

1412
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,200
we kind of have to fix these controls at this because everything we

1413
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,300
design from here on is going to be based on exactly what this is, not

1414
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,300
just sort of what this.

1415
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:19,700
Yeah.

1416
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,500
And that's when I was when I was doing the control stuff, I'm like,

1417
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:26,500
well if we have to change these, this is going to suck because it's

1418
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,800
just totally get because in the goo game beforehand.

1419
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,000
And I had to change controls all the time because you're controlling.

1420
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,900
That's what Google was.

1421
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,900
It was just controlling these big Globs of stuff and you tried to

1422
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,500
envelop other Globs of stuff and that is a control scheme on a

1423
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,000
controller is terrible.

1424
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,600
So a lot of the time I had to try to redesign controls and every time

1425
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,800
I did I'm like, yeah, this is a little better but I don't like it.

1426
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,900
So when meat boy I'm like, well, this is pretty cut and dry.

1427
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,400
He has to wall jump, he has to jump.

1428
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,200
Yes, to run these need to be right first and then we can build on

1429
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,500
that.

1430
00:58:59,500 --> 00:58:59,800
And then,

1431
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,800
As long as the levels are good, the controls will remain good.

1432
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,100
So just want to ask, I think we've got time and I want to make sure

1433
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,900
I'm not ready.

1434
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,200
Okay, we've got we got a few more minutes.

1435
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:14,700
Okay, so one, one final question on the controls is, so the controls

1436
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,800
you said we're digital.

1437
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,100
Why not analog?

1438
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,400
Why not?

1439
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,000
I didn't like the way it felt so, you did try.

1440
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,800
Yeah, I had a thing where, well, it didn't make much sense for the

1441
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,900
game because meet boys like he's either

1442
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Well, I mean you have the Run button but that was the point.

1443
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,900
You have the Run button, you're usually always running, you're only

1444
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,000
going these two speeds.

1445
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,600
There's only like a few places where you have to walk you know there's

1446
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,100
like I think one level in Cotton alley where you absolutely.

1447
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,400
Okay.

1448
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,100
Watch every other time you can run.

1449
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:45,600
Okay.

1450
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,600
So I lost my train of thought again.

1451
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,000
What did you try analog or digital?

1452
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,700
That's Reggie.

1453
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:57,000
Why did you decide digital was the because it's option or the, the

1454
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,800
analog because I never

1455
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,600
I never took and played the game in a way where I was thinking, oh, I

1456
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,900
want to be able to lightly move like I want to be able to, I want to

1457
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,000
have this range of speeds.

1458
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,200
Like it was always either want to walk our own around and that's okay.

1459
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,900
10 you know so like and and when I had like this I had a sort of thing

1460
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,800
where like he would accelerate and he would you could adjust the the

1461
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,100
control to make him like move a little bit faster.

1462
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,400
A little bit slower than his top speed and it felt

1463
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,300
Weird.

1464
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:31,600
Okay.

1465
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,400
And it didn't work in the are either because that also felt it felt

1466
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,300
strange to have something that needed to be fast.

1467
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:43,700
Paced to actually have this sort of artificial ramp up for no reason.

1468
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:48,600
So in some sense you would say that the sort of the feel of Meat Boy.

1469
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Well supposed to be instant on instant off its that that's like I'm

1470
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,000
firing the Thruster or I'm not you and I we it's not about like

1471
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
getting this subtle sort of like I just get a little more lunar,

1472
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,500
lander e?

1473
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,200
Or yeah.

1474
01:00:59,600 --> 01:00:59,900
Okay.

1475
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,300
Yeah.

1476
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,300
Yeah.

1477
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,400
It's all about just stop and go.

1478
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,700
But it was something that you played around with at some point.

1479
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,100
Yeah, very early, I think, I think I scrapped in the first week.

1480
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,300
I'm like, yeah, three months.

1481
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,900
One week was an like, are like, no one week was like, like this?

1482
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,800
This isn't any good.

1483
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,600
So, all right, so we got a few minutes left, just a few minutes left.

1484
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:22,300
So I guess I'll close by saying, what do you have anything you want to

1485
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,800
tell us about what you're doing these days?

1486
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Not necessarily not necessarily game stuff since that's probably Under

1487
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,300
Wraps but like you for example told us that you rewrote how you were.

1488
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,900
All your imported stuff, like any programming stuff.

1489
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,800
I wouldn't know about because I don't know what you're working on.

1490
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,100
You at that.

1491
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,500
You might want to talk about or just mentioned based on sort of what

1492
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,200
we've talked about so far.

1493
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,600
So I am making a testing tool because that's the jewel.

1494
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:49,600
Yeah, I had a terrible experience when Meat Boy launched on PC.

1495
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,000
Okay.

1496
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And I wanted to make sure I never had that again.

1497
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,100
So I'm making like this weird crowdsource testing to really thing.

1498
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,300
I've been working on it for a while, I have it.

1499
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,300
So tell me about so the meatball experience on PC.

1500
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,400
It was just that so many platforms and graphic artist and kind of

1501
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,100
testing strips or tell me a little bit about what you mean the.

1502
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,500
So when we were doing meatboy Meat Boy was going to be we and xBox

1503
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,000
wasn't going to be PC, okay?

1504
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:18,200
Because the whole time I'm thinking like a PC and not not in the but

1505
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:23,100
in the that's a lot of that's a huge range of like, oh yes this

1506
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,500
graphics card this graphics card this you know, I oh man when when it

1507
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,300
came out on Steam there was this off

1508
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,800
Them bug, that sometimes it would just Flickr for people, I'd be like,

1509
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,900
oh, you need these think they put on v singing, though.

1510
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It was a program called Lux, that would adjust the gamma thing, and it

1511
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,800
would make him stutter.

1512
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:45,200
And I'm like, what did you do?

1513
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,400
Why just how okay, I know the program talking about like adjust the

1514
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,200
screen settings to your outside like, yeah, mister something.

1515
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,800
We ask something weird like that.

1516
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,500
And it happened to like five or six people and I was like, Gamers,

1517
01:02:59,500 --> 01:02:59,800
never

1518
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,700
Outside.

1519
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,900
Why would they need utility this?

1520
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,500
What is this utility running on their machines for it's ridiculous.

1521
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,100
Yeah.

1522
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,500
So I was just check for that app at startup and don't ya you don't

1523
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,900
deserve to play you are sir.

1524
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,100
Yeah yeah.

1525
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,900
So when it so it was just going to be on Xbox and we because

1526
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,900
everybody's Xbox the same, everybody's weeds the same and I'm one

1527
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,200
dude.

1528
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,500
And I'm like I don't want to deal with all this stuff but around that

1529
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:28,100
time steam was also like when we first started Meat Boy starting team

1530
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,600
was like are going to come on cool.

1531
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
So Surf and I was like that's neat and then nothing else but then

1532
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:38,100
around mid-2010 they're like oh hey we're awesome and we're better

1533
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,100
than everybody else.

1534
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:45,400
So it's so after like around July of 2010, we're like our, it has to

1535
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,200
come out on PC.

1536
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:51,300
So so it came out on Xbox and then a month later comes out on Steam

1537
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:56,400
and I bought like a whole bunch of computers and I tested it.

1538
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,900
I'm like, okay, this is about the specs and then it comes out.

1539
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,900
And steaming it breaks for everybody, like, how did this happen?

1540
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,200
And it was, and it was three, three or four days.

1541
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:15,600
No, it was three days and I issued 18, patches, and three days and all

1542
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,700
for system-config.

1543
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,500
Yeah, yeah.

1544
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,700
All for these like little things and it was it was stupid stuff

1545
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,500
because, like, it was, it was whenever you have problems like that.

1546
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,400
It's always assumption.

1547
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,700
It's always, oh, this is definitely going to do this.

1548
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,800
And on consoles, you can assume

1549
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,200
Umm, all kinds of stuff, right?

1550
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,800
But on PCS, you can't assume it's because the one you tested on is

1551
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,400
roughly the same as the one that's my ship on.

1552
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,300
So, although yesterday that gets less true over time, they're like,

1553
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,200
yeah, the dashboard might have a Fritos integration for you that you

1554
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,200
do you want to buy them out of the three in the middle of this jump?

1555
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:46,700
Yeah.

1556
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,400
But yes, for the most part, you can kind of count on them to be like

1557
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,800
this Hardware is the same as the hardware.

1558
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,100
Yeah.

1559
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,200
For the most part, or whatever.

1560
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,700
And, and in my own experience in my ignorance, I was like, well, I

1561
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,300
can, I can assume that this, the graphics cards definitely like

1562
01:04:59,300 --> 01:04:59,800
everybody's

1563
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,500
Be able to run this every isn't real, right?

1564
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:07,100
And no so after that happened, I'm like this could have easily been

1565
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:11,900
prevented because I've also found throughout the years that fans are

1566
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,800
the people that want to test the most and will generally be the best

1567
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,600
testers, like, we hired.

1568
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,900
And we paid out, I think through Microsoft, I think we paid out, like,

1569
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,300
50 grand for testing for Xbox.

1570
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,100
And it was required by the elements, whatever, but they miss stuff, it

1571
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,600
was because they were just paid to do it.

1572
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:29,800
Yeah.

1573
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,800
Yeah, like there were some definite fans and I've met some testers

1574
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,000
that actually did test Meat Boy that were like super fans but in at

1575
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,800
the end of the day, they go home at 5:00.

1576
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,700
You know, they come in at 8:00, they go home at 5 and they, you know,

1577
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,200
they test all day and they can miss stuff, and they did tend to miss a

1578
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,600
lot of stuff and we didn't actually have any testers for the PC

1579
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,200
version which would have helped do some of the stuff.

1580
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,900
So, my thinking was there's a bunch of fans.

1581
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:59,000
I can make something that I can just send out builds to people and

1582
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,800
they can test it.

1583
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
And then I can get all their information and I can issue stuff to

1584
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,700
specific people if they have problems.

1585
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,600
So it sounds awesome.

1586
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:06,900
Yeah.

1587
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,900
And I've integrated that into because I rewrote Super Meat World

1588
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,700
because I want it on PlayStation and Vita.

1589
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,900
That was the little level portal thing that again.

1590
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,700
I'm dumb and I'm naive, I don't know if it's dumb.

1591
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,500
It's naive.

1592
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:22,600
Everyone's got to learn some.

1593
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,400
I mean exactly what ship something you can't.

1594
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,800
No.

1595
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,700
Oh, yeah, we're gonna go.

1596
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,800
So, what I did is I made this Meet World level portals

1597
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,300
Thing and I just had it hooked to a mySQL database because I'm like

1598
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,200
it's free.

1599
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
Nobody's going to fuck with it, right?

1600
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,900
And what happens?

1601
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,800
Christmas Eve they like they take it and they fill it in with dumb

1602
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,300
developer.

1603
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,700
I'm like, yeah, I'm dumb.

1604
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,200
I am dumb to not trust the internet, not to be assholes so so that

1605
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,300
like know what the internet's for.

1606
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:49,600
Yeah.

1607
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,800
It is, it's like a search engine the dude, one of the dude even like

1608
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:58,000
he mailed me beforehand and I'm like, just don't mess with it.

1609
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,800
Please just don't mess with like an asshole.

1610
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,500
So anyway, I couldn't fix it because I was at my parents house for

1611
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,200
Christmas.

1612
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,500
I didn't have a phone, I gonna do.

1613
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,700
So, when I got like I was able to like, log into telnet on my like or

1614
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,000
SSH into the server through my dad's computer and like lock down the

1615
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,100
database so nobody can write to it and restore a backup.

1616
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:24,300
But it was like, it was so traumatizing because I'm, like, I hate

1617
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:24,500
this.

1618
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,300
I and it upset me like I can imagine.

1619
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,700
Oh man, I was because

1620
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,300
That's very personal thing when you ship a product especially when

1621
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,000
you're like one or two people who make it.

1622
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,900
It's not.

1623
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:35,900
Yeah, that's like a big fan.

1624
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,900
I have credit card numbers or anything.

1625
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:38,600
You're not.

1626
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,200
I mean you taught me a lesson but that's a lesson.

1627
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,200
You could have taught me without fucking up my Christmas.

1628
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, so Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

1629
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:56,100
So yeah, that was that was like terrible and I had 7500 levels and 300

1630
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,100
custom chapters in it.

1631
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,800
Like and it was, it was up for about 10 months before somebody like

1632
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
So that but yeah.

1633
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,500
So anyway I Rewritten that because I wanted my everything and I've

1634
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:10,200
integrated it into the new Meat Boy code.

1635
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,000
So it's actually in little beta testers right now and they're like,

1636
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,300
it's getting all the data name like Rama Nike Rama.

1637
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,399
Yeah, what does that mean?

1638
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,000
Kyle Pulver, gave it to me.

1639
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,800
It's some lovecraftian zombify in essence and it just sounds awesome.

1640
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,399
So because originally, I thought it was going to be like a seti at

1641
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:29,800
home kind.

1642
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:30,300
And of thing.

1643
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,600
Okay, well I could just anonymously like that and I'm like, wait a

1644
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:33,899
minute.

1645
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:35,600
This might be Skynet eventually.

1646
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,100
So let's not do that.

1647
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,500
Everyone's got to avoid.

1648
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,300
Making the Terminator.

1649
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:41,000
Yeah, but they're gonna survive, but the names.

1650
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,300
Cool.

1651
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,300
So I kept the name.

1652
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,500
Well I think we're just about out of time.

1653
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,200
Cool, thank you so much for talking with me.

1654
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:49,700
It's yeah this is fun and I'm sure everyone out there.

1655
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,200
Pretty yeah.
