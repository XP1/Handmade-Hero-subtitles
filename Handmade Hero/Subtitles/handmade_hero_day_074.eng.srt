00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,300
Start recording.

00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,500
Hello, everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,300
The show Rico to complete game live on Twitch.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,400
No Library, no engine, just us and our code.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,500
And we're at the point right now where we're trying to do a little bit

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
of cleanup for going on break, we are going to be on break next week

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,300
because people wanted some time to catch up so we're going to take a

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,600
week off and people can catch up with the series as necessary.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,700
So what we're doing right now is we're actually kind of going through

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,400
and just improving our handling of

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,900
Of the we're making a 2-D game to some degree, but we also sort of

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,900
have three-dimensional elements in it.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,700
And so, we're kind of doing is saying, well, let's go in there and

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,900
we're trying to figure out exactly how we want to handle that third

15
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,800
dimension, how we want it represented, how we were going to handle

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,900
moving up and down between things that sort of stuff.

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,400
So we sort of Hit Upon something interesting yesterday and we didn't

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
quite get have a chance to really go explore.

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
Its 02 today, we're going to do is were actually going to explore that

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:00:59,700
for.

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,000
I get started though just a reminder anyone.

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,900
A, who pre-ordered the game on handmade hero dot-org?

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,700
If you want to follow along with today's episode coding at home,

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,600
today's episode is day 74.

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,600
So you want to unzip day 73 source code into a directory and then you

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,500
will be able to follow along with us as as we go because that's the

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,600
code that I'm starting with today.

28
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
So let's go ahead and get things started here.

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm going to load up everything that we have going, okay?

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:38,200
Okay, so let's take a quick second to recap, what I thought was a

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
pretty interesting thing.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,900
We kind of discovered yesterday.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,400
Regarding how entities, how any collisions are handled basically.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,300
So previously, let me go ahead and start a little place here for us to

35
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,700
draw day 74.

36
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,000
So

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,500
What we were doing before we kind of just implemented, some very

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,000
simple Collision things and I had sort of thought a little bit about

39
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
some ways we want to handle things.

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,400
And so we had ended up implementing just for the time, being was a

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,000
system whereby assuming that you have enmity and maybe you had like

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,600
here's the hero and here is the monstar and you know you're trying to

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
track them on Star.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,700
You you know, you do something like you throw a sword.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,000
So here's our sword or s word as the case may be

46
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,200
You throw a sword and that sort is going to go and maybe the sword

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,600
might want to pass through the monster and do damage like it's a it

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,200
has piercing or something so it's not going to stop.

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,900
It's going to go straight through and we had a number of ways that we

50
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,700
could think about handling this and there's just a lot of different

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,200
sort of concerns involved in what seems like a very simple thing if

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,300
you actually want to think it through and do it, right?

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,700
There's actually quite a bit here to think about

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,200
and what I had implemented before is, I said, well, you know what I'll

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
do, I'll implement

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Thing which basically says, for any entity pair, like the sword in the

57
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,000
monstar when the sword hits the monster, I'm going to have a system

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
which is basically like a little like, record-keeping thing, right?

59
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,100
I'm gonna have a little table and what I'm going to do is when the

60
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,500
sword hits the monstar because I don't want to process the fact that

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,400
the sword hit the monstar any more than once.

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
I just want to do whatever happens when a sword hits a monster and

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
then be done with it.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm gonna at that point when it hits, when the sword hit, so the sword

65
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,200
Comes This Way.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
It hits the monstar.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm going to go ahead and add in

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
to hear the the sort of the sword monstar entry, right?

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,600
And then from then on every other frame I'm going to look in there and

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,700
see oh sword monstar was already processed so I'm not going to process

71
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
it again right.

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,500
Then when we get to the end and the sword like you know travels the

73
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,100
distance, it's allowed to travel and then has to be removed.

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,700
What we're going to do is we're just going to clear all of the things

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,200
that were in this table, right?

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,400
So anything, that was in the table, I shouldn't say all the things,

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,900
all the things

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
That have the sword in it in this table right there.

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,500
Going to go away.

80
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,000
So that was an easy way that robustly how handles the case where you

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,900
have some kind of projectile and you want to process hits in any way

82
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,800
that you want.

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,300
You can know how many times you've looked at something.

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,899
You can do all kinds of stuff because this table can store whatever we

85
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,600
want and it persists through the life of that of that hit.

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,100
Now what we wanted to do yesterday was we want to say, let's have a

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,600
stairwell, right?

88
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,100
Something like this, where you're kind of like going down into the

89
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,600
abyss.

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,800
Right here is the abyss.

91
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,400
Or just the next floor.

92
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,200
And so you're going to walk down the stairwell and what we wanted to

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
have happen with say, okay, if here's the hero, right?

94
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,800
And they're walking in this direction, this is top down.

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Now, this is from the top.

96
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,000
If we're going to walk in this direction, what I want to do is say,

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,200
Well, when the hero overlaps, the stairwell, then I want him to be

98
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:58,300
able to move downward his, I want his Z to go downward as he as he

99
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,400
sort of overlaps that stairwell, if that makes sense.

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,300
So, when he gets here,

101
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Higher.

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
When he gets to here, I want the Z value to be the next level down.

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,500
And when he's here, I want the Z value to be essentially where he

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,200
currently is

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,500
Pretty basic, right?

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,000
But we want a system that allows us to write code like that very

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,400
easily.

108
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,800
So we don't have to do a lot of thinking about it, right?

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,500
We don't want to have to do a lot of work to implement things like

110
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,800
that.

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,900
We want our Collision sector to make that easy for us.

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
And so what I was going to do is I was going to say, oh right, and we

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,500
started coding this yesterday, all right.

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
We'll have a notion of where the things are inside or outside of

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,300
things.

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,200
So, at the start of a frame will basically do a test to see what

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,900
overlapping.

118
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
So, you know, maybe the heroes here at the start of the frame will

119
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,800
say, okay, he's overlapping, the stairwell.

120
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
And then at the end of the

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
Name Will basically say okay if he's not overlapping the sterile

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,500
anymore, that's fine or whatever, you know, we can process what's

123
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,200
happening during that sort of that movement, right?

124
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Assuming so that's kind of like what we were sort of talking about

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
doing in the you know.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
In the, in the processing of the movement of the entities.

127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,900
And what I realized when I was doing that was like, well, wait a

128
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,800
minute, can't we just use this table directly like can't we just use

129
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,500
the table when we start up and say, okay, when we're overlapping

130
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,600
something, let's add an entry to this table.

131
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,600
And that way there's somewhere to store information about it, as well.

132
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,600
And then when we're done, we can remove stuff in that table.

133
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
That way, we're always using the same thing.

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Instead of having some kind of special handling for things that over

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A lap, we just have a table, which is basically telling us about the

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
situations that these things are in and we just use that.

137
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,500
And that seems like a pretty good way to go to me.

138
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,000
I mean, that just seems like a good way to go so I don't really know.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,600
I mean that's just that's just seems like a good idea and it seems

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,400
like that was going to make things a lot more unified and clear if we

141
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,200
did that in the code.

142
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,700
So that's kind of what I want to explore today.

143
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,300
But other things that I was thinking about as well.

144
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,500
Were things like okay, so when the hero is traveling inside this

145
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,900
region and we want his Z to be mapped to, you know, where he is on

146
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,500
this thing.

147
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,500
You know, we have sort of this other kind of I don't know how you want

148
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,400
to phrase it.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,800
We have this other sort of

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Special.

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,300
We almost want to do a little bit of special processing because of the

152
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,000
fact that these stairwells, you know, if we look up from the side

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
view, right?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Because we kind of want to treat them as ramps.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,300
Basically, when we do our movement processing, you know, our movement

156
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,400
processing is going to work like that and really what we want our

157
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
movement processing to be doing is something like that, right?

158
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,700
We well it would we want to move the same kind of rate so we want to

159
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,100
look like that, right?

160
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,900
That's what we'd like to do.

161
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,000
And so one thing that I was thinking that we could do as well

162
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:56,000
His we could sort of say, okay if we have our, our movement code, when

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,800
it does the move, you know, we've got this this sort of region.

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Check that says, are you intersecting the stairwell?

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,700
If you are intersecting, the stereo, we could do that.

166
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,600
Check again for the destination point and assuming that the

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
destination point is still within the stairwell, right?

168
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,200
We move it down to that to that position or something similar to that,

169
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,700
right?

170
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,900
And that way we can get some I guess we should say we move it down to

171
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,300
that position, right?

172
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,900
I don't know it's kind of complicated.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's starting to really do like full 3d processing sort of on the

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,200
movement of the chi which maybe we don't want to do you know, maybe we

175
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,500
just don't want to deal with that or get into stuff like that.

176
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,299
But I was just thinking about it.

177
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,200
And I was like, well, if you really wanted to handle this correctly in

178
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,900
terms of how you know you would conceptualize the problem in terms of

179
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
a more realistic, simulation of what happens when someone's going.

180
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,200
I mean you could imagine us

181
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,200
And going a little further and saying that there actually was an

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,500
actual stairwell, and we actually looked at where you were, and the Z

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,700
was like, quantized, right to like certain stairsteps.

184
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,700
So the hero goes, like, don't think that, you know, we can do that as

185
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,800
well.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's all sorts of stuff we could do there, right?

187
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,700
And I don't know how far we want to go down that path, but it's just,

188
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,000
it's just something that's worth noting.

189
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Finally.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,400
There's the easiest thing, which I thought of which is actually a way

191
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,100
of cheesing out on all of this stuff and I don't know.

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,100
You know, maybe this is a better way to do it, and we could do it this

193
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,700
way right now and just put a note in, I don't know.

194
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,900
But another thing we could do is instead of processing at the

195
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,100
beginning of the frame process instead of, instead of, allowing the

196
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,800
person to leave or enter the stairwell inside the clitoris, the

197
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,300
Collision, iteration Loop, right?

198
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
What we could do instead is just treat that as something that only

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
gets checked once.

200
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
So basically, at the beginning of the

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,100
If the guy is on the stairwell, then just whatever the move is, is

202
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
just considered a stairwell move.

203
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,900
So the stairwell basically gets to do its operation to the guy,

204
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,300
whatever it's going to be at that outset and that's all there is to

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,900
it, right?

206
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,400
And you know, that's one way we could process it, the end then we just

207
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,100
say, okay, he doesn't until he actually is outside of the stairwell on

208
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,600
the next frame.

209
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,700
That's, you know, if he moves outside the stairwell, then on the next

210
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,400
frame, he won't be under the, under the

211
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,600
The action of the stairwell anymore, right?

212
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:21,900
I don't know.

213
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,500
Again, just something to think about and that may be the easiest way

214
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
for us to implement the stuff for now.

215
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
I really don't know which of these is going to be more interesting.

216
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,800
And you can certainly imagine this kind of applies pretty easily to

217
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,500
other stuff, too.

218
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,900
So let's take another case.

219
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,700
Let's say we take the case of like poison ground or lava or something

220
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
like this, right?

221
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,200
So let's say we have, we have lava here, right?

222
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,000
So this is our lava, right, it.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,700
So it's so hot and burning.

224
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
It burns me right?

225
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Ouch.

226
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,800
And so, you know, we have our hero and our hero moves into the lava

227
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,300
and our hero travels in the lava and the hero moves out of the lava,

228
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,400
right?

229
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,700
So if we want to process this, exactly right.

230
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,100
What we need to do is handle that case where the person enters the

231
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,100
lava and handle that case, where they exit the lava and actually

232
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,500
count, you know, if it's distance or time based actually count exactly

233
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,600
the

234
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,500
Period where they're in it in order to apply like the lava damage

235
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,700
right?

236
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,400
The cheesier way to do it is the point sampling way and the point

237
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,900
sampling way basically says okay I'm going to count however many of

238
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,400
these land in there.

239
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800
So at the beginning of every frame this is not in a lava so it doesn't

240
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,900
take lava damage.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,700
This is in the lava so it does.

242
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,400
This is in the lava.

243
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,700
So does this isn't in the lava so it doesn't right?

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
And so you know, again,

245
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,400
and this is just a question of how, you know,

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
Do we want to make this?

247
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,100
And so if we only want to do the point sampling method, then basically

248
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,500
what we would do is we would say, all right there's a separate check,

249
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,200
right?

250
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,200
Separate check where we check for inclusions in spaces, like,

251
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,600
stairwells lava, anything like that, that aren't Collision events, so

252
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,500
people don't collide with the lava and like enter and leave it or

253
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,000
anything like that, right?

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,400
That doesn't actually happen.

255
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,000
All there is is an inclusion.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,700
Check that happens separately and then, you know, off you go.

257
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,600
And so that might be a better thing for us to do for now.

258
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,200
I don't really know where we basically say.

259
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,800
OK.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,600
We'll do the

261
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,400
For now, we'll just say, we'll do the Separate Checks, it's easier

262
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
because we've already done the code for that.

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,600
And each time we check will just pass the full DT for the frame as the

264
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,300
effect time.

265
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,200
So if we have like a thing that was like, apply lava damage.

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
We tell it, the whole DT for the frame.

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,500
Apply the lava damage.

268
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,900
We won't try to subdivide frames and figure out exactly how much of

269
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,500
the time was spent inside the lava and out, but maybe we'll put in a

270
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,100
to do that.

271
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,500
Basically says, ok, you know, maybe we start leaning on the sort of

272
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,600
the table driven system,

273
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
And try to do some more intelligent stuff.

274
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
There that would allow us to, you know, be smarter basically about

275
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,200
that.

276
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,700
Just something about so I don't know.

277
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,800
I really don't.

278
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,300
I have no, I have no real opinion about how that that should work.

279
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
It's just going to have to be a wait-and-see thing.

280
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,500
So yeah, so maybe we do the simple separate check first and we make a

281
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,000
note, and then we see if we want to go the table route.

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,400
I don't know.

283
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,900
That seems like the best call to me right now because until maybe we

284
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,500
get a little further, maybe eventually, it'll become clearer exactly

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,900
what we need.

286
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,100
Because of other things and then will, you know, go on from there.

287
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,500
And so sort of what I saying is like okay, you know, when we do this

288
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,500
check for initial inclusion instead of doing all this other stuff that

289
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,100
we were doing in here where we were doing our overlapping entities in

290
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,100
this sort of stuff where we were sort of adding and removing things.

291
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,300
What we could do instead is sort of reverse back to the case where we

292
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,200
weren't ever doing that, and we just add the Collision rules, or

293
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,100
something like this.

294
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,600
And we don't actually update that overlapping list.

295
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,800
So we just say okay we don't update the overlapping list.

296
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,000
We don't pass was overlapping.

297
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,700
So let's see, where that was.

298
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,900
We don't, you know, we don't need to do any of that.

299
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:44,400
So when we do our handle Collision call, we don't actually need.

300
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,500
This was overlapping stuff like so on and and you know, we just let it

301
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,900
do its thing and we we leave it at that.

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,300
At.

303
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,300
So now a stairwell is no longer a thing that does collision at all,

304
00:14:59,300 --> 00:14:59,600
right?

305
00:14:59,600 --> 00:14:59,700
It's

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Collision based object in any way.

307
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,600
I don't know how we were planning on doing this.

308
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Exactly will have to want to click.

309
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,000
Let the take a second at the end of this to sort of clean that stuff

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,600
up a bit.

311
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,000
But basically.

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,400
So right now what we do is instead change this to basically like

313
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
handle, you know,

314
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,000
I know what you want to call it, but handle overlapping events right?

315
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Or handle events based on area overlapping or something like that.

316
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,200
And so what we can do here is say, alright, we're going to go through

317
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,500
and we don't really need to record anything per se, but we would go

318
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,600
through and just say anybody who does movement past the obviously have

319
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,900
a thing here, where they're going to check for all the things that

320
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,600
they could be sort of overlapping.

321
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,800
And for anything that they are overlapping, we process a rule.

322
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,400
So it's basically like a, you know, a handle overlap kind of a thing,

323
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,100
right?

324
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,700
And so what I'd like to do is say this is going to happen before we

325
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,300
actually try to take any step, right?

326
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,000
So this is going to happen like right at the beginning, right?

327
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,100
Just just flat-out.

328
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,800
So right here before we do anything else, we're going to go ahead and

329
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,900
we're going to see if we're over.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Overlapping anything.

331
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
So we'll call that handle overlap.

332
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,400
We will pass it exactly the the two that are overlapping and we'll say

333
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,000
that we kind of have a notion of who is moving so the Mover and the

334
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,900
and the, you know, region or whatever.

335
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,600
Right?

336
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:44,300
And and we'll do like a should overlap as well for like can overlap,

337
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,800
right?

338
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
And so the entity the thing that's moving is always going to be Primal

339
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,300
in this case

340
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,300
We're going to handle it that way.

341
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,300
So we do, you know, we always say that the can overlap in the handle

342
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,600
overlap are both going to kind of do their thing.

343
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,400
So we'll do it that way.

344
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,500
And then we'll have our should Collide, right?

345
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,500
I guess we should keep our name.

346
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,599
It's really should overlap test.

347
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,400
Its the bad, it's bad name.

348
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,900
I wonder if it shouldn't just be can write Can-can.

349
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,300
When can we go?

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,800
That seems better should Collide.

351
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,400
And in fact, I guess we don't really need this at the moment, either.

352
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,500
This is just can Collide.

353
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay, so if I do that, then we've got our can overlap in our handle

354
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,800
overlap.

355
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,700
This is not important anymore and there we go.

356
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,500
Except I need changed.

357
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,900
Its name.

358
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,400
Here.

359
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,600
And presumably.

360
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,300
I need to pass that.

361
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,000
There we go.

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Alright, so now we need to, you know, I should also probably just

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,800
double check that we didn't break anything doing that change.

364
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,600
So let me just go ahead and make sure that our code is still happily

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,000
running.

366
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,200
There it goes and that's all good.

367
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,400
So now we need to do is just say, all right we're going to test the

368
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,500
entities, we now know you know they're going to overlap and I'll just

369
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,200
write a function which handles the entity overlapped such that.

370
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
If a hero or any other thing, overlaps a stairwell.

371
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
It's Z gets

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Move downward or upward depending on where it is, right?

373
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,600
And that seems pretty straightforward.

374
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,600
Unfortunately, we're going to have to do some work to actually make

375
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,900
rendering show us that any real degree.

376
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,000
We don't have much in the way of that yet, but that can always be our

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,400
next, our next task, move and region, call that mover and region.

378
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,000
So the thing that's moving in a thing that needs it overlapping.

379
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
So basically, if the region right now,

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Don't have anything really here but you know, essentially we're just

381
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,100
doing if the region type is one of those stairwell regions than pretty

382
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,400
much.

383
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,900
That's the only case that we actually need to handle at the moment.

384
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,400
But you know the lava case would be another example here of something

385
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
that we want to do.

386
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,900
So we've got our handle overlap as well and we will build that out.

387
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,600
That's again, just taking whoever is moving and whichever entity it is

388
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,500
sort of moving

389
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,700
Or it is contained in.

390
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
And I also said, like I was saying before I want the the time step in

391
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,000
there, in case there's a time-based effect that's happening that way

392
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,900
it applies it for a period of time so that if we do decide later to

393
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,700
handle little more accurately, and in fact, I'll put that to do in

394
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,900
here to do handle overlapping precisely by moving it into the

395
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,000
Collision Loop.

396
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,900
And you know we'll just keep we'll just keep improving things as we go

397
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,600
if we decide that's a good idea.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,300
All right.

399
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,500
So anyway if it's stairwell the result is true otherwise Loops the

400
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,600
result is true.

401
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,600
Otherwise the result is false so that's pretty straightforward for

402
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,000
now.

403
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It'll consume to get more interesting later and then when we go to

404
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
handle the overlap, what I want to do is say that assuming that the

405
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,700
region is a stairwell

406
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm going to do that processing where I'm going to effectively change,

407
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,900
and I'm assuming I'm going to basically change the position and

408
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:42,700
perhaps also change that velocity to be pointing downwards as well.

409
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,800
You know, I'll just take a look here at how that works.

410
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,700
So the DDP, let me see, let me see what we're doing here.

411
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,300
So the DDP is passed.

412
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,900
It in right?

413
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,800
Is that what happens?

414
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
So, we're passing in that acceleration and

415
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
The acceleration.

416
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,000
The acceleration gets gravity added to it as well, right there,

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,500
mmm-hmm.

418
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,600
I mean, I suppose.

419
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:28,600
I suppose really all we would have to do if we wanted to is modify the

420
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,500
ground location when you were on the stairwell, right?

421
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,800
Because this code right here, actually, we'll just do what we needed

422
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,700
to do.

423
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,800
Scary is that is so I wonder

424
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,400
I mean it sounds a little odd but like I wonder if we don't just want

425
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,500
to do it that way for now.

426
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,700
So in other words you'd handle it at the end of the frame.

427
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,000
It be backwards looking don't love it.

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,500
But and you basically say, like, where's the ground, the ground zero

429
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,200
zero or something like this, right?

430
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,100
You see what I'm saying?

431
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,000
And then you would basically update the ground inside that hand, that

432
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,400
handle overlap call.

433
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,000
It's kind of weird, but it sort of starts to get it.

434
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,900
What I would like, which is, you know, a notion of where the ground

435
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,200
is.

436
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,300
So maybe it's not that crazy and it's probably not exactly how I don't

437
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,900
love the way, it's kind of weird, but, you know, in this 2D thing

438
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,600
where we don't really have a strong notion of where the ground is,

439
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,600
we're gonna have to kind of build a semantic, understanding of ground

440
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,100
that

441
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Make sense everywhere.

442
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,000
And so I'm just going to kind of let this go.

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,300
I'm going to see where it leads because I'm hoping that eventually it

444
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,500
will sort of coalesce into a nice way to handle ground.

445
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,600
Again, like I said, I normally program 3D stuff so I'm used to having

446
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,300
to think about a ground is like some full 3d thing.

447
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,900
And in this case, that would be a real waste of time and energy for

448
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,500
the game to even have in it.

449
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,000
So it seems like you'd rather just have the ground is always the

450
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,300
ground.

451
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,000
And the only time that you really do, anything else is when you're on

452
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,600
something special like a stairwell or some other special sort of Z

453
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,700
affecting thing.

454
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:23,000
So yeah, I guess we'll just say you know we'll we'll go ahead and say

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,500
that we've got ground here.

456
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,400
We could even make the ground be a general query I guess we could just

457
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,900
make actual ground shapes and

458
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,100
I think we die that seems like a waste of time so I'm thinking you

459
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
only really want to handle colliders.

460
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,500
Yeah.

461
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,700
So I'm going to keep I'm just going to keep exploring this but I just

462
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,000
don't feel comfortable yet.

463
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,500
I don't have a solid idea of exactly what I want.

464
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,100
So I'm going to, I'm going to keep on pushing pushing here and and

465
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
we'll see what happens.

466
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,100
So for now I'm going to pass the address of ground so it can modify

467
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,200
it.

468
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
But later, what we might do is pass kind of a

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,500
Bundle of stuff to that handle overlap, and let that do it instead.

470
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,300
So yeah.

471
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,000
So, what we'll do here is, we'll just say, alright?

472
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,100
You can modify the ground level.

473
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,200
So what we'll do is we'll come up here and in our handle overlap call.

474
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,000
We will pass in that ground ground level.

475
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,300
So benefits stairwell, then, what's going to happen is we're going to

476
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,000
find out where you are in the stairwell and set the ground level

477
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,300
accordingly, right?

478
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,800
And that,

479
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,900
Also brings up another thing which is I realized how we really should

480
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,200
be drawing stairwells which is not with a stupid rock, which is what

481
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,000
we were doing before.

482
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,200
But it's really actually with a rectangle, what I should have been

483
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,100
doing was was using a rectangle.

484
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,500
So I'm going to take a look here and see about drawing a rectangle.

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I know we've got one in our draw hip points function, so I'd like to

486
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,100
do is I'd like to do one of these push wrecked calls.

487
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:56,700
Oh,

488
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,600
Wow, just the other night.

489
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,000
Someone asked about Vector forest and I was like, eventually we'll put

490
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,200
some in for handling colors.

491
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
It looks like we already did and I totally forgot.

492
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
I knew we eventually would but I guess eventually was actually in the

493
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,400
past.

494
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,900
So, whoever asked that question, not only eventually will be put in

495
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,400
colors.

496
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,200
We actually already put in colors as before us.

497
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,900
There you go.

498
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,500
You'll learn something about your codebase every day that you should.

499
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,500
No because you wrote it anyway so I'm gonna go ahead and here and I'm

500
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,600
going to say that we're going to draw that stairwell as an actual

501
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,500
rectangle now so that we don't have any of this weird wondering,

502
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,000
exactly what it's dimensions are.

503
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,800
They'll just help me to debug it basically.

504
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,300
So I'm going to do a push wrecked on that piece group.

505
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,400
We've got basically a location that we want to draw and then we've got

506
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,900
Dimension.

507
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't remember at all.

508
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,500
What we actually did for our

509
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,700
You know, conventions here.

510
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,800
So I'm just going to look it up.

511
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,700
It says, basically that we pass the group, we pass where it is, I

512
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,700
assume relative to the camera, so it's relative to the piece.

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,200
So it's actually just the center right there, it's no offset.

514
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,900
We've got the offset Z which again we don't really need any of.

515
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,600
It can just be drawn flat on and then we have its Dimension.

516
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,300
And so it's Dimension is just going to be, it's entity actual emptied

517
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,600
to mention, right?

518
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,500
So that's just going to be entity dim XY, right?

519
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,800
So then the color will just draw an, you know, yellow there.

520
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,700
So we can see.

521
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
And, and that should be

522
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,100
Just about all we need, I think to get our stairwell.

523
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,500
So let's take a look at our stairwell.

524
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,200
There's our stairwell, that's good.

525
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,700
And so, what we want to do is be able to move on to that stairwell and

526
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,500
just kind of, like, move on to it and have it allow us to move not

527
00:26:59,500 --> 00:26:59,800
only

528
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,300
On through it.

529
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,700
But basically like to move down a level as we go or in this case, I

530
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,400
guess up a level so that should be relatively straightforward.

531
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,000
However, what we do need to do is we need to be, I guess this gets

532
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,900
actually a little bit complicated, a little more complicated than I

533
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:25,000
was thinking because we do have one other case that we can decide how

534
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,300
we want to handle I guess.

535
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
But basically

536
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The last thing that we do have to worry about is when somebody moves

537
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,300
on to a stairwell, right?

538
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,300
There's two ends to a stairwell.

539
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,100
So I guess we could look at it from the side view again, right?

540
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,800
So there's two ends to the stairwell.

541
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,600
And let's say that somebody is walking up here, right?

542
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Because here's the here's the floor or whatever, right?

543
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,500
If somebody walks, whoa, that was ugly.

544
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,900
I know what just happened there.

545
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,600
So somebody walks here.

546
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,900
We don't want them to snap down.

547
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,100
To hear because they shouldn't be able to do that on the stairwell.

548
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,200
I don't think what we'd rather do is prevent them from walking there,

549
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:07,500
right?

550
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,500
We want to stop them that should hit and stop, whereas if they walk

551
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,300
onto this end, then that's fine.

552
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,700
Because then they just go down the stairs like they should.

553
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,400
So the question is, how do we want to handle that case, right?

554
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,200
So at first, I'm not going to handle that case, but then we've got

555
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,700
that issue which is basically, you can just walk straight onto it and

556
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,600
we'll see what we want to do.

557
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,500
What we could do is put in blockers.

558
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,900
That block you from doing that, and the stairwell is a hybrid of that,

559
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,500
right?

560
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,200
And then the other thing we can do is handle it in the actual

561
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,800
stairwell processing.

562
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,800
So at the stairwells understand that, and I don't know which one of

563
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,000
those two will be more logical but, you know,

564
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,400
We'll find out.

565
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,900
All right, so if we do this now, I think we're good to go with drawing

566
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,300
it.

567
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,100
So oops, what I do.

568
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,400
I accidentally type you, so really all we need to do here is just say,

569
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,800
okay, where is the the guy inside this region?

570
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,900
And, in order to do that, what I want to do is introduce the concept

571
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
of a mapping for any rectangle, and because this is just kind of a

572
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,700
thing that might be handy and we need

573
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,300
For this case, we might as well do it.

574
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,500
What I want to do is say all right for any of our three-dimensional

575
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,200
rectangles, which we now have, right?

576
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,800
I want to be able to say there's a minimum corner to this rectangle,

577
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,700
right?

578
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Let's say that this is our minimum corner, right?

579
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,500
And here is our X.

580
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Here is our y.

581
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Here is our Z, right?

582
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,900
And so this minimum corner and then it has the dimension is is the

583
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,600
distance over to the maximum Corner which will say is here.

584
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,400
Let's right.

585
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,000
What I'd like to be able to do is given a point P.

586
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,700
Right, let's say that this point here.

587
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,800
I'd like to be able to produce what amounts to barycentric coordinates

588
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
for this rectangle, meaning coordinates

589
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,900
Range from 0 to 1, right?

590
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,400
Our famous 0 to 1 because everything is nice in the 0, to 1 range,

591
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,800
right?

592
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,700
Range from 0 to 1 and which represent how far along each axis of the

593
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,000
rectangular, the the right rectangular prism this shape, how far you

594
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
are the box, right?

595
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,400
So, basically, if in X, you were here, then you would be something

596
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
like point for, right?

597
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,900
If you were here, you'd be like .8, if you're here,

598
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It'd be one if you'd hear your be 0 and the same on all the other

599
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,500
axes.

600
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,500
So we'd take what's a normal 3D Vector, right?

601
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,900
And we want to produce those now.

602
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,800
How do we produce those?

603
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Well, the first thing we want to do is recognize that the minimum is

604
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
0, 0, 0 in our coordinate system, right?

605
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,500
In when we're saying, we want to produce these new coordinates, we're

606
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,900
saying that if you're at the minimum right, you would be at the

607
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,000
barycentric coordinate 0, 0 0, right?

608
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,600
And I'm saying barycentric, but that's probably

609
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,700
Not really necessarily a useful term to use here.

610
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,700
So I guess what I just want to say is in some sense relative.

611
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,100
Normal coordinates relative meaning their relative to the where the

612
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
box is.

613
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
So the Box may actually be out in Space, the origin.

614
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Maybe like over here somewhere, right?

615
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,400
So this may actually be 000 in our coordinate system and this is the

616
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,600
minimum of the box, right?

617
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,600
So, the box is actually out here somewhere, but we want to create a

618
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,700
little mini coordinate system, essentially, where the minimum corner

619
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,300
of the box is 0, 0 0, right?

620
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,300
So it's relative, we're producing relative coordinates and we're

621
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:38,700
producing.

622
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,100
Normal coordinates, normal, meaning they are normalized, right?

623
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,400
Meaning they are between 0 and 1.

624
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,100
So even if this box is 10 meters long, I don't want it to be 10 when

625
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,900
it gets to here.

626
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,200
I wanted to be one

627
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,800
So, how do we make it relative?

628
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Well trivial?

629
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
We just subtract the place that we actually want to be 0.

630
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,900
0 0, right makes perfect sense.

631
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Because if we know that we want the point Min right in our coordinate

632
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:16,100
system to map 2000, then Min minus Min obviously equals 0 0 0, right?

633
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,600
So, what we want to do is just subtract Min from our coordinate

634
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,100
system,

635
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
You could think of this, you could do this in Algebra 2.

636
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,200
If you wanted to sort of, if you, let's say you just have no idea.

637
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,500
You're like I don't know how to do that.

638
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,900
You can say, well, I've got a point for any point, right?

639
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,100
I want to I want to basically add something to it.

640
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,900
I want to do some kind of translation.

641
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,600
Right for our question, mark value, you know, whatever it is, we don't

642
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,200
know, vexed.

643
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,900
Some V for every point.

644
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:48,300
We want to add some V, okay, this is our expression and we want that

645
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,500
point to equal our relative coordinates

646
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,800
It's right.

647
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,900
So this is our relative coordinates or we could say p Prime.

648
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,700
So these are our relative coordinates.

649
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,400
So what did I just say?

650
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
I said when we, when we do,

651
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,400
In.

652
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,600
We want that to be 0.

653
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,700
0 0 well just plug those in when I pass the point Min, right?

654
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,100
I get 0 0 0, right?

655
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Or the 0 Vector, that means Min plus v equals the 0 Vector, right

656
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,100
solve the equation for the thing.

657
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,700
We want to know, V equals 0, minus Min, or - min

658
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,200
So that lets us know exactly what we need to do.

659
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
We just subtract Min from anything, we want in order to get it,

660
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
centered around this thing, all right.

661
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,800
Simple enough.

662
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,400
But now we have coordinates that can be anywhere in this box.

663
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,300
They happen to be 0, 0, 0 here but they could be as long as they want.

664
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,200
And again, how do we normalize something?

665
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,100
Well we know how to normalize things, right?

666
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,900
If you have something at a given length and you want to turn it from 0

667
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,600
from 0 to the length in 2021, you just divide by the length, right?

668
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,000
We've done this a bunch of times like vector lengths and all that sort

669
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,500
of stuff.

670
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:04,800
So we have right our point - our minimum / however, long that point.

671
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,600
Right for any given.

672
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,500
So, you know, it's kind of hard to sorry.

673
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Not how long the point was.

674
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
How long the Min is, right?

675
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
We want it to be relative to this.

676
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,900
We want it to be relative to the maximum extent of the axes.

677
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,500
Right?

678
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,300
So, you know, over however, long, the Min is that gives the new

679
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,800
coordinate, right?

680
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,100
So p x Min X, right?

681
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,100
This is basically the, the equation for one of the exes to the same is

682
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,600
true for the

683
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,800
wise and the Z's, right?

684
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,300
So subtract, the Min /.

685
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,199
You know what?

686
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,500
I don't even know what am I?

687
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,000
I'm going way too fast here.

688
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,000
This is not even this.

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,800
This means nothing.

690
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,800
What have I written here?

691
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,800
There's no such thing as the length of men.

692
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,300
We already said that.

693
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,699
That's, that's that's stupid.

694
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,900
Pretend I never said that.

695
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,900
That's not what I meant.

696
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,300
I meant the length of one of these things, right?

697
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
That's Max.

698
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,100
Minus min.

699
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah.

700
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,300
Going too fast.

701
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,100
I got carried away.

702
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,500
It's true.

703
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,000
Right?

704
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,500
Because if this is the max x-coordinate and that's the minimum x

705
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,000
coordinate of the thing than the length between them is the max minus

706
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,100
the Min, right?

707
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,900
So little mistake there, pretend I didn't say that.

708
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,200
So that's what we want.

709
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,800
We want that Max, minus the Min X, and so on.

710
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,900
So that's, that's pretty easy, right?

711
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,400
It's not, it's not complicated.

712
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,500
It's very straightforward when you think about it, but I want to make

713
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,500
a function that basically does that, so I can grab that value.

714
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,900
Anytime that I want.

715
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,900
So what I'm saying is I want to basically do V3, get saved very

716
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,600
eccentric.

717
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,100
And we'll pass some rectangle and some point, right?

718
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,700
And then what we're going to do is for each of the coordinates.

719
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,300
We're just going to go ahead and make those coordinates fee equal to

720
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:58,100
the equation that I just said which is you know the you subtract the

721
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,800
Min so a DOT min.

722
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,100
X so on and you divide by whatever the length is, right?

723
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:13,600
So a DOT Max, dot x minus a DOT Min got X, like so and that's just

724
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,500
going to be pushing the dot that way.

725
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,500
And that's pretty straightforward there.

726
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,200
Now we do have one problem which is that in the case where these were

727
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
zero like what one of the dimensions was collapsed, the The Entity

728
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,800
didn't have any size there that would be illegal right?

729
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,500
This would produce a nonsense value.

730
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,800
So since I don't know that we really have a performance concern here.

731
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,300
I'm going to introduce another thing that we can do to make this a

732
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,200
little bit more robust to those kinds of failures.

733
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,200
Which is a safe ratio function.

734
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,700
And the way that I like to do these is to say you pass a numerator,

735
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,400
you know?

736
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,600
And you pass a divisor, right?

737
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,700
And it does a divided for you.

738
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,400
So basically, it just does the result equals the numerator over the

739
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,700
divisor, right?

740
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,300
Like, so,

741
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
And the returns that to you.

742
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,400
But what we can do now is we can say.

743
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,300
Alright, this safe ratio will be designed to return a particular value

744
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,700
in the case where the thing doesn't actually work.

745
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,100
Right?

746
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:29,700
So if that divisor is, is not equal to 0 will do the Divide, but if

747
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,400
the divisor is equal to 0 will return some prefab result.

748
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:38,200
And so safe ratio 0, I usually do that as well as a safe race.

749
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
A 1, right?

750
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,100
That would return one in the case to depending on what the default

751
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:43,900
value should be.

752
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
And so one thing that's pretty handy to do event.

753
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,400
It usually is to do safe ratio and and then that just returns whatever

754
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,100
the N is.

755
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,200
And then I make essentially in line versions of the other two, that

756
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,300
just return, those prefab values, right?

757
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,400
That makes sense.

758
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
Hopefully that makes some sense.

759
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,500
So basically it just goes, safe ratio, n.

760
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,500
And passes the numerator, the divisor and whatever the value actually

761
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:12,900
is.

762
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,000
There we go.

763
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,700
Results.

764
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,700
And so again, this is for cases where you're less concerned about

765
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,600
performance and more concerned about robustness you don't care if

766
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,400
you're doing a bunch of if checks to see what the situation is.

767
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,200
And in this case I think that's probably where we would be most of the

768
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,900
time and certainly in we had a case where it was a performance

769
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,200
problem.

770
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,900
We just optimize that one case, right?

771
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,500
No, big deal.

772
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,900
So let's just go ahead and say that these are all going to be safe

773
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,600
ratios and so that way in the case where they actually have a problem,

774
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
they'll be okay.

775
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,600
So if one of these

776
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,800
Mentions is, you know, erroneous and collapses, 20 will still be able

777
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,500
to produce a value there, so that seems fine to me, right?

778
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,800
Safe ratio 0 Station, 1

779
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,900
Articles and trash can icon zero.

780
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,200
Yeah.

781
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
So that's all good.

782
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,700
And so that allows us to do our barycentric.

783
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,800
Here, you can say get barycentric and this will give us our

784
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,300
barycentric version back.

785
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,800
So now we can say that we have the Region's dimension.

786
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:23,700
Do you mean?

787
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,900
This is kind of a little bit of a roundabout way to do this, I

788
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:36,300
suppose, if you think about it, well I think we have Center dimension,

789
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,800
right?

790
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,600
So our region we pass in pays for the rectangle bounding box that

791
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,800
represents the region like so then we just say wherever the the actual

792
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,700
mover was we get those barycentric coordinates back and one thing we

793
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,000
can sort of do here, we could also assert that they live.

794
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,000
Between 0 and 1.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,300
Because one of the things that's true about this is this will not

796
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
clamp those values.

797
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't know if we want to clamp those values.

798
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,300
We could write, we could additionally.

799
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,200
Say that they have two teens are in one because let's say that you

800
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,300
pass in a pea that's actually outside the box, it would not clamp it

801
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,000
to the box.

802
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,500
So maybe we want to do that eventually, I don't know.

803
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,200
In this case we're only handling when we overlap so we know that

804
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,300
pretty much does have to be.

805
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,300
So what I'm going to do is say alright we get that Bary Centric back

806
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,700
now we know where you are and we're saying that.

807
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:24,900
Why?

808
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,900
Why I guess is our range.

809
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,200
You know, why is the thing that we want a very Z by?

810
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,700
So what we're going to do is we're going to say that whatever that y

811
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,400
value that comes back, that's how far right that's that barycentric.

812
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Y value is for our stairwell that bear, something y value is how far

813
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,400
you've gone, right?

814
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
So here's one end of this Arrow host the other.

815
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So let's just say that we take that

816
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,700
Value and that determines that that Z value of the ground, right?

817
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,300
So we want to do is say that the ground equals the barycentric V

818
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,500
value, y value, and we want to do essentially a linear interpreter or

819
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,000
a linear interpolation like alert here, right.

820
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,200
And what alert base is I've talked about this many times before, it's

821
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,700
that magic function and I said we would use everywhere and have used

822
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,500
multiple times already and will continue to use a bunch of times,

823
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,000
right?

824
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,800
It's this thing 1, minus t times, the starting Value Plus T times.

825
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,400
The ending value moves, you between two values proportional to this

826
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,100
tea and the tea is ranges from 0 to 1, right?

827
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,300
You've seen it multiple times, if you don't remember it now, be a good

828
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,400
time.

829
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,800
To go back for a refresher to where I've talked about it before or

830
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,700
watch the interpolation video that's on my

831
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,600
My thing, I have a whole video that's just about interpolation, but

832
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,600
anyway, so what we want to do here is say this T value, right?

833
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,200
The T value is our y.

834
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,300
That's our y value.

835
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,600
How far you are in thing, are barycentric, why?

836
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,700
And the s in the, ER, the Z.

837
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,500
As we want.

838
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,000
So, this s value would be like the Z Min and the E value would be the

839
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,600
Z Max for the ground, right?

840
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,500
And so, as you go, you go up, we could also make it the other way.

841
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,600
As you go, you go down.

842
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:11,200
Who cares?

843
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,500
Doesn't matter for our stairwell.

844
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,700
It would be nice to draw in a particular direction.

845
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,500
So, we probably could do something like that where we try to draw it a

846
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,600
little more clearly, which direction it was going.

847
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,800
I can think of a pretty easy way to do that.

848
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,200
Maybe we'll go through that in.

849
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,200
But anyway, so what we want to do is we want to do that, linear

850
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,600
interpolation.

851
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,700
We haven't made a function for it yet.

852
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,500
But we should throw it in here, right?

853
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:38,200
That's just as easy way to sort of do lips, especially to D3

854
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,300
dealerships, that sort of stuff.

855
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,600
We probably want all of those.

856
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,300
Right.

857
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,100
So, where is our squaring function?

858
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,600
There it is.

859
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,300
Let's make another one here, alert function.

860
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,700
So there's our alert function.

861
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,500
It will go from A to B like so.

862
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,400
So here's our results and our result is just a is just going to be

863
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,800
that.

864
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,600
That 1 minus t plus T times B is exactly the thing that I just said in

865
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,700
that we have used before that's going to be the value that we get

866
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,000
back.

867
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,600
So we're just going to go ahead and lerp using that barycentric

868
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,800
y-coordinate as the lerp, we're going to lurk between RZ Min and our

869
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,700
zMAX orz Min is whatever the Region's p.

870
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,700
Z value is

871
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,700
Write Plus, or I should say actually we can we can actually do this

872
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:20,900
right?

873
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,800
With our rectangle.

874
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,200
So if we, if we remember what our rectangle is right here, is our

875
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,000
region wrecked.

876
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,900
Region right now we can just say OK the region wrecked, it's Min Z and

877
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,500
the region r x, max Z, that will just learned between those right?

878
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,500
And that changes the location of the ground.

879
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,100
And now, since the guy is always pinned to the ground, basically,

880
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,500
he'll just snap to the ground.

881
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,100
Now, unfortunately, I said we don't really have any good rendering for

882
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,400
this stuff or anything like that course.

883
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
We need one more thing to which is that the guy can

884
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,100
Kitt, the stairwell.

885
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,600
So we need we need to actually make this so that this isn't actually

886
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
in the Collision.

887
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,800
This is actually in can Collide.

888
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:19,300
So we want to do here is say something like this result is false that.

889
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:20,600
All right.

890
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,400
So, I think now we should be able to walk through the stairwell.

891
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,000
I hope.

892
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,500
Oops, guess we set a breakpoint there.

893
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,500
I don't know why we must have done it before.

894
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,500
So why am I still colliding?

895
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Can Collide should be returning, false now.

896
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:35,900
Oh, is it?

897
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,800
Because I didn't sort those two guys, right?

898
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,300
Yeah, that's because this isn't sorted, so we need to do this either

899
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,700
way.

900
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,700
So basically what we need to say is if if it's a stairwell at all, you

901
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,400
don't want to do it.

902
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,200
There we go.

903
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,200
All right, so now in theory, we should be able to do something where

904
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,400
we look and see how our stairwells are working.

905
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,700
We should be able to get these working.

906
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,200
We're going to need some way to actually render where we are and Z,

907
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,800
which I guess is our next step.

908
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,100
But at first, we can at least go into the debugger and see whether

909
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,200
we're actually handling the stairwells by inspection at all, right?

910
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,300
Because we just wrote a bunch of code there and we have no idea what

911
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,400
it does or if it works.

912
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,400
So, let's go ahead and actually do that.

913
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,200
So, we got our can Collide your hand, a collision with a bubble, but

914
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,200
this is what we want to see, right?

915
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,300
Oh my, what is overlapping the stairwell right now?

916
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,900
Dare, I ask.

917
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,200
Why are we getting called?

918
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,700
Right at startup handle overlap.

919
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,500
Oh, because we don't check for.

920
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,100
Yeah.

921
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,400
All right.

922
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:44,700
That's a problem.

923
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,400
We don't check for things overlapping themselves overlap, right.

924
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,900
We remember to do this here, where we did the sort of

925
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,600
A not equal to B so we did this right?

926
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,900
But we did not actually do that for the the overlapping so we want to

927
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,800
do is say that things that are you know obviously things that are the

928
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,400
same thing can't overlap each other.

929
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,900
Of course.

930
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,300
No, I think about it.

931
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,200
Why are stairwells moving?

932
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,400
Oh because everyone gets moved now.

933
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:28,300
We should probably have a thing that says that stuff like stairwells

934
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,100
don't move, right.

935
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,500
Like we probably need a flag for that because we really don't need to

936
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,900
call move entity on these sorts of things, right?

937
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,200
So we want to say that if that's not set and probably we want to do

938
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,100
something here where we do like entity

939
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,600
And they flag movable or something.

940
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,000
Right?

941
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,700
We probably want the concept that something can and can't move to sort

942
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,900
of be baked in there and some sense, right?

943
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:07,700
And the flag movable equals like that and then only look, our monstar

944
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,900
are familiar, those sorts of things would have that.

945
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,500
So let's let's double-check that.

946
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:11,800
Sorry.

947
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,800
I just, we just never did that and I was like why was that thing even

948
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,000
getting a move call?

949
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,200
So now nothing should be

950
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,400
To move, presumably now but it still is.

951
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:21,700
So what did I

952
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,200
So it's bright.

953
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,100
It's supposed to be is set movable?

954
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,500
Not is not set that.

955
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
That's kind of obvious.

956
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,300
Sorry, there we go.

957
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,300
It would be non movable.

958
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,600
All right, so nothing can move now, which is what I wanted and now we

959
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:44,600
can just go in and say when we add things like the monstar monstar, we

960
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,500
can say that, you know, it collides and it is movable right?

961
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,900
And I don't know, does add flag allow multiple ads.

962
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,800
I assume it probably does but it's not called add.

963
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,300
Flags is the thing that's a little bit weird.

964
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,800
Don't you think

965
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,000
It seems a bit strange ad.

966
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,600
Flat roofs.

967
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,000
Add flag.

968
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,700
Where is that flag?

969
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,600
Rep.

970
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:09,900
Add flag.

971
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,600
So yeah, this is really add Flags.

972
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,800
So we should probably say that for now.

973
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,100
Let's take a look at that at flags flags.

974
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:36,000
Flags flags, flags, flags, flags flags, flags flag.

975
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:36,900
There we go.

976
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,200
So that way we can just kind of go like, okay, we'll just put both in

977
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:40,600
there.

978
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,700
Same thing with the familiar.

979
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,200
Oops.

980
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:54,900
And layer and the sward should also be in there.

981
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,700
I think, right there we go.

982
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,700
We gotta clean those flags up because the collides thing is now all

983
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,800
kinds of weird because we're going to we're sort of working on what

984
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,000
those systems even mean.

985
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:13,000
Alright, so now in theory, we should be able to actually do something

986
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,100
with the overlapping so let's see.

987
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,000
What we've got, all right.

988
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,900
So here we are in our in our sort of barycentric mapping code.

989
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:30,300
Let's see what we were, you know, got back.

990
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,800
So that's, that's just totally wrong if I'm not very much an error.

991
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,600
So we have a bug here because our y value should not be - oh,

992
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:45,900
You know what?

993
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,500
It totally can be negative because these are regions that are

994
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,300
overlapping.

995
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,300
So we do we.

996
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,400
Yeah, right.

997
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,000
Like that's totally true.

998
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,500
We already need the clamp thing.

999
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,100
I said we didn't need the clamp thing.

1000
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
You shouldn't listen to me.

1001
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,200
This is why you don't listen to KC believe the, the debugger, because

1002
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,500
the debugger is, right.

1003
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,500
So, we've got a situation where a guy can be overlapping, the

1004
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,200
stairwell, right?

1005
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,700
But his point is not in the stairwell.

1006
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,800
So it seems like we really do want to clamp the value to the minimum

1007
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,000
and maximum of the

1008
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Of the rectangle.

1009
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,400
So that so we do want we do want clamped barycentric.

1010
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,500
So yeah, let's go ahead and do that.

1011
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,900
We would a native that anyway, so no big deal handle overlap.

1012
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,800
Let's do get clamped barycentric.

1013
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,500
and we will go ahead and I guess we could also do

1014
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,000
How do I want to do that?

1015
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,100
I could just do it this way.

1016
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,000
Right.

1017
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,400
Something like that.

1018
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,100
I think I like that better.

1019
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,200
Let's do it that way.

1020
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,000
So inside the math functions, I'm going to go ahead and do a little

1021
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,500
clamp function here, which we may want to do something better for in

1022
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,200
the future right?

1023
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,100
In terms of how we implement it.

1024
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,300
But so we want to do here is say alright we're going to have a result.

1025
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,700
The result is going to be equal to the value but if the oops the

1026
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,700
result is less than the minimum.

1027
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,000
The

1028
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,200
Equal to minimum.

1029
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,300
And similarly, if the result is greater than the maximum, the results

1030
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,300
going to equal the maximum and then we will return the result, right?

1031
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,500
So I think, you know we could do that faster with Cindy.

1032
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,900
I don't know if the compiler smart enough, it probably is.

1033
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,300
Who knows these days and then what I'm going to do is I'm just going

1034
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:55,700
to introduce a clamp that specialized again 401 because that's a very

1035
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,600
common thing that you want to do.

1036
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,700
So basically you just pass a value and that value

1037
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,300
If I you just passed the value in that value will automatically have

1038
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,000
the zero and the one passed with it.

1039
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:09,800
Like so.

1040
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,400
And that will be the result of that function, return result.

1041
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,700
And then what we'll do is we'll just actually have the oops.

1042
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,800
What'd I do wrong, that's fine.

1043
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,500
And then what we'll do is we'll just have this for our various V2 V3

1044
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,300
before, is that sort of things, right?

1045
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,000
So for now, we'll just go ahead and say, all right, we've got that

1046
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,200
clamp, 01, that will take.

1047
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Of the three and it will return a V3.

1048
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:42,800
And the result X is just the clamp 01 of the of the input X just clamp

1049
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,700
each of its elements.

1050
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,500
Like so, right Z

1051
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,300
And done.

1052
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,800
So,

1053
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,600
Now, we should not have that problem, right?

1054
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,400
Where's are?

1055
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,300
There it is.

1056
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,300
So now our why should be 0 it is off we go, right?

1057
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,900
And now our Y is actually coming up a little bit.

1058
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,300
So let's take a look at what ground actually equals.

1059
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,700
So when we ask where the ground was, oops, where the ground was

1060
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,100
originally?

1061
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,000
It should be 0, right?

1062
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,600
Because that's what's normally set to, and when we're done with it,

1063
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,900
the ground is negative point.

1064
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,600
Five two.

1065
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,300
Is that sensible for our ground?

1066
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,900
I'm not sure.

1067
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:32,300
Let's take

1068
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,800
Look.

1069
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,400
Oops.

1070
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,800
Where is our region region P.

1071
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:46,100
Its Z is at zero and it's Dimensions.

1072
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:46,600
Yes.

1073
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,700
Oh, that is actually reasonable.

1074
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,500
But that also means our stairwells, probably not positioned quite

1075
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,200
right.

1076
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,000
Because it looks like where we've actually put our stairwell is in the

1077
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:56,900
wrong place.

1078
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,300
If this is one level,

1079
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,800
This is one C Level and this is the next sea level.

1080
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,400
It looks like the way I did it.

1081
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,800
Oops, was I put the stairwell like that, but we really want the

1082
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,400
stairwell to do, it's something more like that, right?

1083
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,000
So that was a mistake.

1084
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,200
That's a little bit of a mistake.

1085
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,300
So let's go ahead and try to fix that mistake.

1086
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,500
And actually, even to think about it a little further.

1087
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,900
We really want that stairwell to include a pretty wide.

1088
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:36,000
We want to test for a fairly wide area, but then only actually applies

1089
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,500
easy from here to here.

1090
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,900
So, what we may want to do is have a separate dimensions for the

1091
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,700
stairwell and the actual locations where the guy is going to move

1092
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
along, right?

1093
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,100
But that's, you know, six of one half, dozen of the other.

1094
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:51,900
All right?

1095
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,500
So anyway,

1096
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,600
We now have our stairwell.

1097
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,000
We need to go in here and see about where we're actually putting it at

1098
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,700
stairwell.

1099
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,900
Let's find out add stare and yeah.

1100
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,400
So that's just yeah, right?

1101
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,000
We want to we want to do a thing basically, we're when we add the sky,

1102
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,500
when we get this chunk position from tile position, we want to do an

1103
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,200
offset of that.

1104
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,100
So we want to, we don't want it centered around the Z level, we want

1105
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:22,700
it to be.

1106
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,900
Staggered.

1107
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,200
So I'm going to do just because I can because I'm the programmer and I

1108
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,400
guess do whatever I want is I'm going to go ahead and say that our

1109
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
tile depth in meters.

1110
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,900
Here I'm going to go ahead and say that we're going to offset it,

1111
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,600
right?

1112
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:41,100
So we pass an offset and the offset is going to be this.

1113
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,700
So if it's at that Z,

1114
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,800
We're going to offset It Up by half so that it's in the middle there

1115
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:56,100
between the two Z layers, that seems like a better plan to me.

1116
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,700
So if we do that, then what we need to do is update that chunk

1117
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:01,800
position call.

1118
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,800
So in our handmade world .h, right?

1119
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,300
Our chunk position from top position, position isn't a position has to

1120
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,000
take additional offset, right?

1121
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,300
And the additional offset is just going to be

1122
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,000
Added straight up, right?

1123
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,000
And this will be defaulting to the null Vector, so people who calling

1124
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it and don't want to do with that at all.

1125
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
They don't have to

1126
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,600
so that I think would make it a little bit more.

1127
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,400
Like, what I was expecting to have happen because now, if I restart so

1128
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,600
that it's in the new Pluto, it's not showing up there.

1129
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,700
Did I offset it somehow too far?

1130
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,700
So it's not included.

1131
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,400
What did I do that?

1132
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,900
Should still put it right.

1133
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,800
That should put it.

1134
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,300
That should still make it so that it's actually inclusive.

1135
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,900
Right.

1136
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,100
You know what?

1137
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,900
We may have one more thing we have to do for our Z, when we actually

1138
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,800
gather all of our entities are,

1139
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,200
Actually gathering in the Z bucket, properly.

1140
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,200
And I don't know, right?

1141
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,200
It's it's this thing Min chunk P.

1142
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,800
Yeah, we're not, we're not at all right.

1143
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:19,600
We, we are purely fabricating that Z value, which is which is garbage,

1144
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:19,900
right?

1145
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,800
This should actually be looping over all of the Z's that were in our

1146
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,500
Min and Max chunk value.

1147
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,300
So that's a holdover from when we

1148
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,700
When we weren't actually doing an easy stuff.

1149
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,600
So, yeah, that's one more thing that we didn't really think of, but it

1150
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,200
is definitely something that needs to happen.

1151
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:44,100
Now, what I don't know is how we're actually Computing these bounds in

1152
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
the first place.

1153
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:53,200
Those the camera origin, the camera region, not really sure what we

1154
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,200
did with Z there.

1155
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,800
Right.

1156
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,800
What if what do we actually do for camera bounds?

1157
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,700
So, we did a tile, you neither.

1158
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:06,500
Direction, I guess or Center Dim?

1159
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah, so we did half a tile in either direction that I don't know if

1160
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
that's really what we want, but at least we've done something.

1161
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,800
So there we go.

1162
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,100
Oh, that's hilarious.

1163
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,200
So our Z sort of already worked a little bit.

1164
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,600
Because it's offsetting those guys by the Dare distance down.

1165
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,500
So we're actually seeing two levels at the same time now, which is

1166
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,500
kind of cool.

1167
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,900
That's funny.

1168
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,600
I didn't realize that would happen, but it did.

1169
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,400
So now we're Gathering, both the entities on the top and the bottom

1170
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,300
that's kind of funny.

1171
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,500
All right.

1172
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,900
Well, so in theory, we should be able to move up and down here.

1173
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,200
But we don't actually, I don't actually know if we are

1174
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,800
So, we can't go through there because it's blocked.

1175
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,800
If we go through the other direction, can we now go through it now.

1176
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,400
So, let's find out why we're not going up and down here.

1177
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,600
Let's let's see.

1178
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,700
So are we in handle overlap?

1179
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,000
So we're not actually actually overlapping this thing.

1180
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,100
So are our test for overlapping must not be actually hitting, right?

1181
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,500
Are overlap test.

1182
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,500
What do I want?

1183
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,200
What do I want to do to check that?

1184
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,100
So,

1185
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,800
Rectangles intersect, how are we doing our test?

1186
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,700
So that, you know, it's a pretty tight thing that I asked to do and

1187
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,700
it's probably not how it like I said, we'd want to wider range for

1188
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,600
doing that inclusion testing, because if the guy is right on the Z

1189
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,000
value then, you know, that's a little bit iffy but at the same time,

1190
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,100
he should be right at Z equals 0, right?

1191
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,700
And so if he's right at Z equals 0, it's still that test should still

1192
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,400
be passing.

1193
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,200
So I kind of want to see why it isn't.

1194
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,300
Let's just go a quick second into the Q&A because I just I just want

1195
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,800
to see before.

1196
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,400
We end for the day and pick up that to bugging tomorrow.

1197
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,500
I just want to see what exactly was happening there.

1198
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,500
So I set a breakpoint in the hero code and go ahead and run that.

1199
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,300
I'm going to go ahead and now see when we step into that move entity

1200
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,000
call.

1201
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,200
I'm going to go ahead and see what's happening with the overlap test.

1202
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,400
Such that it fails, right?

1203
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:29,800
So we come in here and we're, we're going to do this.

1204
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,400
This right down here.

1205
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:32,800
So right here.

1206
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:39,100
So let's go ahead and do that, and the can overlap thing should should

1207
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:39,700
happen.

1208
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,600
There we go.

1209
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,200
And now we should be testing against against the stairwell, right?

1210
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,600
So, let's just double check, but that's what we're doing.

1211
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,300
So, the entity type is the hero.

1212
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,600
The test entity type should be the stairwell.

1213
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,600
So, there we go.

1214
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,200
So let's see what our two rectangles are.

1215
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,400
So there is our enemy wrecked.

1216
01:00:59,400 --> 01:00:59,700
There's our

1217
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,900
Sanity wrecked.

1218
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,000
And let's see.

1219
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:11,900
So the problem is, our entity is slightly below the Z line because he

1220
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,800
hasn't been, okay?

1221
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,500
So that's the problem, The Entity has gone below the Z line, right?

1222
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:22,300
Because he hasn't been clipped yet and so he doesn't hit the

1223
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:26,100
stairwell, which I guess is going upwards, right?

1224
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,100
And is placed at Z equals zero.

1225
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,800
So it's worth noting that this is kind of a tricky situation, right?

1226
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,100
Um if we're you know this this is again sort of underscores the

1227
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,400
trickiness of semantic Z handling where we're basically saying all

1228
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,700
right we don't really have a concept of ground.

1229
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:52,500
You're just kind of walking along it and so I wonder if we need to do

1230
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,000
something where like that ground support.

1231
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,100
Yeah, I don't mmm.

1232
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,900
I mean that sort of argues for doing the test at the beginning and

1233
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,200
picking the ground support based on that somehow, right?

1234
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,500
And I don't know if that's, I mean, that's the cheesy situation.

1235
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,200
That was where I had it originally.

1236
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,400
I don't know if that's such a good idea because it seems like you want

1237
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,200
to end him on the ground where he is.

1238
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,400
So I'm not sure.

1239
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm not sure.

1240
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,300
I'm not sure what the right fixes for that yet.

1241
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,900
Because again, I want I want something that feels solid to me.

1242
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:38,300
I don't want a super janky concept of where the ground is.

1243
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,700
So, you know, that that starts to sort of feel like to me that I need

1244
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,300
a little bit more of an intelligent sort of handling for that

1245
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,600
groundless and maybe the Z needs to be dealt with a little

1246
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,200
differently.

1247
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,800
Like maybe it was a mistake to

1248
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,600
Great.

1249
01:02:59,600 --> 01:02:59,800
The

1250
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,700
In here, maybe we don't want Z Motion in there.

1251
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,700
Maybe we always want two dimensional updates and we don't do

1252
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,700
three-dimensional updates.

1253
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,800
And then we handle Z after the fact, I don't know the trivial solution

1254
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,400
here obviously is to make the stairwells a little bit bigger, right?

1255
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,800
The, the super cheesy thing is we just make the stairwells handle

1256
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,700
that, but that's really lame.

1257
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,000
You know I'm saying but that would do it for now.

1258
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,400
So if I did add stare or we do this, if we made this a little bit

1259
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,000
bigger.

1260
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,800
So instead of it only being that long, you know it's a little larger,

1261
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:39,500
right?

1262
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:45,800
I'm going to put it to do Casey this is extremely not cool, figure out

1263
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:54,400
a better, ground update solution, I believe that would would fix our

1264
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,900
From there, right?

1265
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,500
Let's see here.

1266
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,400
Yeah, so there we go.

1267
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,900
And now we're actually working properly, of course.

1268
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,000
Yeah.

1269
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,600
Whoa, what's going on there?

1270
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,100
There we go.

1271
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,600
So let's see.

1272
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,500
So we can't go through here now and then, let's see if we can walk up

1273
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,000
the stairs.

1274
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,800
Is that up the stairs?

1275
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,500
Is that down the stairs?

1276
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:16,800
I don't know.

1277
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,800
Which way the stairs go.

1278
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,800
I think about that.

1279
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:23,700
I assume that's we're still not quite going doing what we want.

1280
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:24,600
Let me see.

1281
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,400
What happens when we do our alert?

1282
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,800
What's the ground value?

1283
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,700
0 should be right and we do it at seven so we should be going up.

1284
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Let's see what happens.

1285
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:42,000
Oh well, that's one more thing we have to finish before.

1286
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,100
All right, promise this is the last thing.

1287
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,400
I just want to see if this works.

1288
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,000
So yeah, we actually need to use our ground value to say the least.

1289
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,800
All right, so let's see here.

1290
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,900
Does that work groups?

1291
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,100
And the stairwell does go up in the up Direction at the moment.

1292
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,300
So there we go.

1293
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,700
Let's see here.

1294
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,300
So that goes up and that goes down in theory, right?

1295
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,200
I wish I had you going to need some way of telling you because I can't

1296
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,600
really tell at all what's going on since we have no rendering but

1297
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:24,700
yeah.

1298
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,300
So that definitely, I mean he's moving up, you can even see him move

1299
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,400
up, right?

1300
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,300
But for some reason I can't go through here.

1301
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,000
Oh, you know why?

1302
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,700
I guess, because these entities are not being three-dimensionally.

1303
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,600
Hit tested.

1304
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,400
So that's the next thing we have to do.

1305
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,800
Because if we have entities on here we need them to actually be 3D hit

1306
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,400
tested.

1307
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,400
All right, so we're getting closer.

1308
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,000
This is kind of interesting.

1309
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,200
This is going to be really kind of fun for me because I like I said

1310
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,000
I've never done a game that was purely to do before.

1311
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,900
It's kind of fun, working out how I want to handle.

1312
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,300
Things when you don't have actual 3D, you have kind of like pseudo 3D

1313
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:10,200
and you need to, you want some amount of 3D but you don't want it all,

1314
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,700
you know, you don't want to have to go and actually have meshes in

1315
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,500
there for everything.

1316
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,000
It's pretty interesting.

1317
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,500
So yeah.

1318
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,700
So what's happening there is these entities are still blocking.

1319
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:23,100
So you need to kind of like you can imagine all that test in here

1320
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:26,000
where we do the Collision testing.

1321
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,700
We're testing its entities that are below you and we are only doing

1322
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,300
Two dimensional Collision testing.

1323
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:38,400
So if you no matter how far below it was, it's not going to actually

1324
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,500
work, right?

1325
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:46,500
And so you could almost think of it as like, you know, the, the sort

1326
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,700
of weird version is like this, right?

1327
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,700
And easy peasy, right?

1328
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,900
Assuming that they're on the same Z plane, then they can actually be

1329
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,900
considered colliding with each.

1330
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,800
They're otherwise, they're not allowed to write or something like

1331
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,200
this.

1332
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,500
Oops, that's mistake.

1333
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:15,300
So if we did that, then in theory, you know, you can do this and then

1334
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:22,500
walk through like so and then if we wanted to go back down, we do that

1335
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:24,000
and

1336
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:26,700
That didn't work either.

1337
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,100
That is how I would go back down.

1338
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,000
Right, there we go.

1339
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,100
Guess I just didn't quite do it.

1340
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:31,500
Right?

1341
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,300
Yeah.

1342
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,800
So pretty janky, you know, we've got a ways to go.

1343
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,200
Let's put it that way, but at least we're sort of getting there,

1344
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:40,900
right.

1345
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:45,200
We've got a little bit more happening now and it's a little bit weird

1346
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,000
how this works.

1347
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,200
So we're going to have to kind of

1348
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,900
Yeah, so basically the other thing that we have here is since gravity

1349
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,000
is letting the guy go down, we're not actually moving the guy down.

1350
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,800
We're just setting that ground.

1351
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,200
And letting him sink through it.

1352
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,800
It's really more like letting him sink into the stairwell, which is

1353
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,000
why if you run over it quickly, you don't actually go down a little

1354
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,100
and so we also probably want to treat it like a real stairwell and not

1355
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,900
have that Ridiculousness happen, right?

1356
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,100
Because that's just kind of dumb but that's kind of fun.

1357
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,700
So that's interesting.

1358
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,600
All right, I need to go to the Q&A.

1359
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,200
I'm kind of interested in here.

1360
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,000
Like I said, it's some of some parts I'm going to get a little carried

1361
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,200
away with because like I said, if

1362
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,100
Something that I don't normally work with on a day-to-day basis, then

1363
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,200
it actually becomes kind of intriguing to me to and and I'm liable to

1364
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,200
kind of get carried away.

1365
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,399
So we'll put it, we'll put it off, we'll put it off, we'll start the

1366
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,500
Q&A and and we'll pick it up tomorrow, but I'm interested.

1367
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,500
It's going to be fun tomorrow.

1368
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,300
And in fact, I have to wait that long now that I think about it

1369
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,800
because it's Friday, right?

1370
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,300
And that's a morning stream normally.

1371
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,800
So tomorrow, it'll be nine.

1372
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,300
I want to wait that long only 12 hours between now and then so that's

1373
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:05,700
good.

1374
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,800
It's the familiar going to be programmed to be able to go through the

1375
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,100
stairwell or instantly teleported to the floor.

1376
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,300
I feel like the familiar should have to go through the stairwell.

1377
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:25,700
I think.

1378
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,500
I mean, I don't know.

1379
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,899
I feel like everyone should have to use the stairs unless they can

1380
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:34,399
fly.

1381
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:41,000
Like, if the familiar since it's sort of flying, maybe it can fly up

1382
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:48,399
and down, like, if there's holes between regions or something, I don't

1383
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:48,600
know.

1384
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,300
I really, I don't know the answer that question.

1385
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,600
That's a very good question and I don't know the answer to it.

1386
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,400
So who knows.

1387
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,500
We'll see when we get there.

1388
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,300
What are we going to do priority for which Sprite is in front and in

1389
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,200
the background?

1390
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:09,500
That'll be.

1391
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,300
That's so you said, I don't know what that's called.

1392
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,900
That's called sorting.

1393
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,300
Really is all or occlusion.

1394
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:21,700
I know there's a number things you could call it, but basically, we're

1395
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,900
going to do that when we get to the renderer probably if you wanted to

1396
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,300
do it it's not particularly hard, right?

1397
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,400
All you'd have to do is sort your entities by, you know.

1398
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,200
And in fact you don't even have to write it because I

1399
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,800
You know, we don't we're not really supposed to use Library, so we'll

1400
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,600
write the sword ourselves but if you didn't want to, you could

1401
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
actually use qsort to do it.

1402
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,500
There's actually one built into the sea in the sea Library.

1403
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,800
So if you look here, this thing will run a quick sort for you.

1404
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,900
And so if you want to do it ahead of when I do it, all you have to do

1405
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:01,800
is instead of actually rendering the stuff.

1406
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:04,000
So I've already even

1407
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,400
Set it up basically for you do it.

1408
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:07,900
What happens?

1409
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,000
Is this push bitmap stuff.

1410
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,600
You know, we've got this piece group thing, that's just like a stopgap

1411
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:13,900
thing.

1412
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,000
Eventually what will do is will push all of the things you want to

1413
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:17,500
render.

1414
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,800
So they'll just be like an array and all the things that need to get

1415
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,900
rendered, go into it and then they get sorted, right?

1416
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,800
And so basically, that, push that piece where you're pushing things

1417
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,000
on.

1418
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,900
You just push those into a giant list, sort it, and then draw them.

1419
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,700
That's all you have to do and then you're done.

1420
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,800
So it's really, really easy.

1421
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,200
The only reason we haven't done it yet is because I have to teach you

1422
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,600
how to write a sorting routine, which is, you know, a sort of a couple

1423
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,500
day thing to talk about and go through and whatever.

1424
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,400
And so, you know, since it really isn't germane to the design, if it's

1425
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,500
such a simple, basic idea.

1426
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,700
It's not something that we've had to address in order to do the rest

1427
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:58,200
of our work.

1428
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,100
You mentioned that you'll be able to attack from below below above.

1429
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,300
We were able to do that in the stairwell.

1430
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,100
I think I said, I didn't want you to do that.

1431
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,700
I mean, I want you to be able to, if there's something that's two

1432
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:14,100
floors.

1433
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,400
High like a giant boss monster, maybe you could do that, right?

1434
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,400
But I don't want to, I don't want there to be like attacking things

1435
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,800
below from up above because it always felt weird.

1436
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,400
So, unless there's a special thing that you like drop or if you push

1437
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,700
something off a ledge,

1438
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,400
That would be fine.

1439
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,800
But I just, I don't like hitting downward.

1440
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,900
It always feels bad to me.

1441
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,300
And so hitting only happens like in the plane, in my opinion.

1442
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:03,300
So there's a question about if I already talked about programming

1443
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,600
entity systems, no, we haven't yet.

1444
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:13,400
We talked about how we're doing our spatial handling of entities.

1445
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,400
How we're doing our update, handling of entities and also now how

1446
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,600
we're doing our sort of a collision prostaglandins which is sort of

1447
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,100
what we're doing.

1448
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,800
We're doing a little of that right now as well but we have not

1449
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,200
actually talked about entity systems or how entities like really

1450
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,200
interact with each other.

1451
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,900
That will be a ways.

1452
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:36,300
On the line, actually, because what I want to do is when we start that

1453
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,800
that will be sort of the point of no return on game stuff.

1454
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,900
Meaning, when we start the entity system, we will go straight through

1455
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,700
to the end of the game.

1456
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,900
So, we'll have all of our engine pieces in place except the entity

1457
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,500
system and the energy system will be developed concurrently with the

1458
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,100
game and be expanded, kind of overtime.

1459
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,400
Does the scope of this application include moving environments?

1460
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,500
Yes.

1461
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,100
So we will we will probably do a very significant upgrade of the

1462
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,000
Collision system.

1463
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,200
When we decide that we're done with all of the sort of featuring sorts

1464
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,600
of stuff, so moving environments, could be something that we put in.

1465
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:24,700
In fact, we could, we could sort of play with that.

1466
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,500
I could put that on the to-do list here of things that we should play

1467
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:27,900
with.

1468
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:37,800
Which we could do kind of, you know, moving things, pushing other

1469
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,500
things.

1470
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:41,000
It's called that.

1471
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:44,500
Yeah.

1472
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,500
Will the game have color grading?

1473
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,900
Yes, we could totally have color grading.

1474
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,800
The blue and black cloak, the

1475
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,300
Where's may appear as two other colors and some lighting conditions?

1476
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:08,800
I'm telling you that has nothing to do with lighting conditions,

1477
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,200
though.

1478
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,800
That's, that's just the internet is messing with you.

1479
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,900
That's about surface reflectance, which is a totally different thing.

1480
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,000
It's not color grading.

1481
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,400
That was not a white balance problem that was a reflectance plus

1482
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:26,300
white, white balance problem because something blue cannot turn

1483
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,800
something blue cannot appear gold

1484
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,900
Through white balance alone, right?

1485
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,400
That's like not that's not going to happen.

1486
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:41,600
I mean maybe if the white balance was full banana cakes, it would have

1487
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,000
to be the like worst white balance in the history of time, I would

1488
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,100
think but maybe not, I don't know.

1489
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,300
Maybe there's some really bad cameras out there.

1490
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,900
What are the peace groups and how are they used useful for our current

1491
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,200
use in Sprite rendering.

1492
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:13,700
So the idea is there sort of a halfway house at the moment for our

1493
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,200
rendering?

1494
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,500
Because when we go to do the renderer basically what'll be happening,

1495
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,100
is essentially what you see Happening Here with these peace groups.

1496
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,400
There won't be a group anymore per say it'll just the piece group will

1497
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,900
actually, just be a little thing that allows you to quickly assemble

1498
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,000
an entity together by sticking Parts onto.

1499
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,900
Right, like right now, we had three parts to the hero, right?

1500
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,700
There's a torso, the cape, and the head.

1501
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,700
And so, it's just a little thing that says, I'm putting together an

1502
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,400
entity, here's where the entity is.

1503
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:43,000
I don't want to keep having to add that offset in the peace groups

1504
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,900
doing that, and it's also recording the things that need to get

1505
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:47,500
rendered.

1506
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,400
But in the future it won't do that.

1507
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:52,100
Second thing we probably won't call it a piece group anymore.

1508
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:55,200
Either necessarily will call it like a coordinate system or something,

1509
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:55,600
I don't know.

1510
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,500
But in the renderer the renderer will actually be the thing that's

1511
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,000
recording everything that needs to get drawn.

1512
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:04,100
On and then it will handle the sorting and coloring and all that stuff

1513
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:04,900
that needs to happen.

1514
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,800
Can you please somehow Uhn blank?

1515
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,200
Swear has been removed, the net coding for DayZ, standalone and finish

1516
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,700
what Dean Rocket Hall gave up on.

1517
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,300
So, I will say, first of all, that I have never played or even seen

1518
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,500
DayZ standalone.

1519
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:42,400
I do not know who Dean Rocket Hall is, and I am the last person you

1520
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,100
want to go in and fix someone else's code.

1521
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,300
Because usually, I just get really grumpy and complain a lot.

1522
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,800
If you want someone to parachute in and fix someone else's code,

1523
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,100
there's really one man for that job, ladies and gentlemen, and that is

1524
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,800
Mike's Arden.

1525
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:03,300
So that is the person you should be asking because he is the guy who

1526
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,100
does exactly that he like just parachutes into absolutely abysmal

1527
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,800
non-working code and turns it into something that functions.

1528
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:19,200
Well, enemies, follow you upstairs are down.

1529
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:24,600
Yeah, I don't see why not, if they do, how will the space outside?

1530
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:30,500
The camerawork should work exactly like the space inside the camera.

1531
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,000
Not sure what you mean by that.

1532
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,200
How will you handle sprite animation?

1533
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,400
Are you using a library?

1534
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:52,200
And have you ever heard of the spine, 2D skeletal animation framework?

1535
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,800
I have in passing heard of the spine?

1536
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,800
2D skeletal animation framework, but I've never actually looked at it

1537
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,500
for sprite animation, will probably be doing it mostly procedurally.

1538
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,600
But if for some reason we decide that we can't do it, some of it

1539
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,300
procedurally.

1540
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:13,700
I was considering doing like a little converter for spriter so you

1541
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,200
could make them

1542
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,500
Writer and output them.

1543
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,800
But I think I strongly suspect will be able to do everything

1544
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,500
procedurally.

1545
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,800
So I think every all of the animation will probably be able to be

1546
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,400
procedural.

1547
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,300
And that's what I would like to do because that allows me to teach a

1548
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,300
lot more programming.

1549
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,200
This is not, you know, an animation.

1550
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
This is not an animation class so I would rather teach you guys how to

1551
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:38,800
program animations.

1552
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,800
Then teach you how to make them in a tool and read them.

1553
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,100
Because that's pretty boring and pretty obvious how to do too.

1554
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,200
Who is that guy?

1555
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:59,300
Who is Mike, sartin, Mike sartin know if you can find him.

1556
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,700
Is this guy?

1557
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:03,400
No, that's not him.

1558
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,700
That's some other Mike certain.

1559
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:06,900
I don't know where he is.

1560
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,500
He's might, it's just Mike's art on Twitter.

1561
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,500
I don't know why I can't find him.

1562
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,500
There, there he is.

1563
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,000
That's him.

1564
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:21,200
And this is him to finding bugs in the Linux kernel.

1565
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,200
He was one of the main guys who did there it is.

1566
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:27,600
That's him.

1567
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:35,900
So he's he's like a guy, he works at valve, he still work at Red, he

1568
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,200
did it, a bunch of steam, the steam Linux stuff, he fixed, like the

1569
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:44,500
the bunch of stuff in the Team Fortress 2 server.

1570
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,300
That was busted, he fixed a bunch of stuff in the DOTA server is like

1571
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:50,600
he parachutes into a lot of stuff when people are like we don't know

1572
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,200
what's going on.

1573
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,200
It's like I got this so you know, he's the guy who came to mind where

1574
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:55,900
I just like

1575
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,700
if you, if you're going to try and convince someone to save you on a

1576
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,200
Jacked it ain't me because I just get grumpy and complain a lot and

1577
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,100
that doesn't fix the problem, right?

1578
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,400
I'm mostly the guy who writes stuff from scratch for totally new code,

1579
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:14,800
right?

1580
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:19,200
I'm that guy, I'm not the guy who comes in and holds his nose and then

1581
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,700
like actually figures out what's wrong?

1582
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:21,700
And fixes at all.

1583
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,500
So Jack krauser, I'm still not sure what you mean.

1584
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,600
When you say I mean with there being different floors, will it be

1585
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,500
different I'm assuming not

1586
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:54,100
Yeah, I mean my conceptualization of the world so far is that we want

1587
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,400
to make it as rich as possible just because it's harder to program.

1588
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So if enemies can follow you up and down stairs or decide to go up and

1589
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,100
down stairs themselves, that's just harder programming for us.

1590
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:11,300
So I think we should do it because it forces me to have to do more

1591
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,600
stuff.

1592
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,100
Which lets you guys see how to do more stuff and how I approach it,

1593
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:15,700
right?

1594
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:17,500
So that's

1595
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:19,400
He wiii make decisions that way.

1596
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,800
I don't think there's necessarily gameplay reasons why enemies have to

1597
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,500
go up and down stairs.

1598
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,400
And if we found that we were taking too much time and we're have to

1599
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,600
cut features, we could cut something like that, right?

1600
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,400
So that's fine too but it's just that's usually the way I look at it.

1601
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,600
It's like well is it easier or harder to program if they can go up and

1602
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,500
down stairs, it's harder to program at the enemies.

1603
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,300
Can go downstairs.

1604
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,600
So let's make them go up and down stairs.

1605
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,100
Can you run this game?

1606
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,500
So some of us can see its current state.

1607
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,200
Well, we haven't really done any game stuff yet so it's not

1608
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:02,000
particularly interesting and I probably would have to switch to single

1609
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,400
level to do that.

1610
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,400
Really all we did is is we're just working on our spatial partition

1611
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,700
stuff and our enemy collisions and that's our stuff we're basically

1612
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,600
working on the engine.

1613
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:17,400
So so there's not really a game to show per se, but if we were to take

1614
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:17,500
out

1615
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:25,000
Sort of the the the up and down stuff, I guess for lack of return, for

1616
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,100
lack of a better term.

1617
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,100
We should probably make an if for that, but basically if we were going

1618
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,700
to do that, we would have to do.

1619
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,100
Let's see where we do.

1620
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:42,000
The three thing, we'd have to basically if zero this out, right.

1621
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,800
We'd have to do something like this.

1622
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,000
We did this before because right now we're making multi-floor things.

1623
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,700
So we do that.

1624
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,200
I think so.

1625
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:56,600
It could only ever pick the other one.

1626
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,100
I'm not sure if that's right.

1627
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:00,800
We'll see.

1628
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,400
So basically yeah, all we were doing was we were just trying to make

1629
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,400
some basic stuff.

1630
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,300
So we started out, we've made some tile map stuff and then we extended

1631
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:11,800
our town map.

1632
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,100
So now we don't have a tile map anymore.

1633
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,400
We actually have entities, but we left them in sort of a tile map.

1634
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,300
He sort of configuration.

1635
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,600
They don't actually have to be there.

1636
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,200
You can put stuff anywhere you want.

1637
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,200
We haven't really put much art assets in.

1638
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,000
So we're drawing trees, even though?

1639
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,800
Yeah, we're just drawing trees and anyway, you know, we can make

1640
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,200
rooms and walk between them and all that sort of stuff.

1641
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,400
We haven't done the renderer yet.

1642
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,700
This is basically, we wrote a temporary renderer.

1643
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,400
So that's why things don't sort.

1644
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,300
For example, you notice, if I go behind this tree, like, that doesn't

1645
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:40,800
make any sense.

1646
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,000
I should be in front of it.

1647
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,800
That was the thing we were talking about earlier on the Q&A about

1648
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,600
sorting, right?

1649
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,200
We added projectiles in and we tested that you can only have one of

1650
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:52,500
them and that's where stuff we added hit points in.

1651
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,400
So, you know, you can attack things.

1652
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,700
I think there's a monster back here.

1653
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,800
Oh this this little guy we met do follows you around, right?

1654
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,500
That was just testing having like a familiar, you know, kind of thing.

1655
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:06,500
So you can, you know, attack things and they lose, hit points,

1656
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:07,000
whatever.

1657
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,900
But again like this isn't game stuff.

1658
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:14,700
Yet what we're doing, since the point of the stream is, do everything

1659
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:15,400
from scratch.

1660
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,800
It's the opposite of go grab unity and drop some stuff in, right?

1661
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,900
We're not doing that.

1662
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,000
What we're trying to do is do the whole game from scratch.

1663
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So so people can see how to write a renderer, how could write a sound

1664
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
system, a music system, like all of these things.

1665
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,800
And so, what we've been doing here is working

1666
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:30,600
on our architecture.

1667
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,100
And I've been trying to show everyone how you build all of the parts

1668
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,800
of the game, and how they interact, and we've making pretty good

1669
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:37,600
progress on that.

1670
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,100
We've still got a ways to go, though.

1671
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:44,100
You can kind of see, we've got our little to-do list here, right?

1672
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:46,400
Which is the stuff we want to work on.

1673
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,600
We want to make a little debugging system, that's our next big thing

1674
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,400
will probably do.

1675
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,700
Then we want to do some audio mixing in that sort of stuff.

1676
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,800
We want to asset streaming put in some metagame stuff, figure out how

1677
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,800
the world gets generated and

1678
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,200
Some AI pathfinding in fighting, then we will do our main game passage

1679
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,700
basically, like doing animation.

1680
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:10,800
Figure out how we want that to work, then doing the real renderer and

1681
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,500
then starting on the full final game.

1682
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,200
Like that's the code that ships from then on.

1683
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:16,700
Right.

1684
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,700
And so you know that's why it says we only do an hour a day so it's

1685
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,300
very slow, you know?

1686
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,900
Right now you know we're on Day 70 for that's only 74 hours of coding.

1687
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,800
It's not even to work weeks yet.

1688
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:30,400
Right?

1689
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,100
If you work a 40-hour week, we haven't even done 2, weeks worth of

1690
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,600
programming.

1691
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,500
So it's not a whole lot of programming, but I've been pretty happy

1692
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,100
with where we've been at so, you know, I'm pretty happy with it, but

1693
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,600
like I said, there's no game to show yet so you know, come back in 50

1694
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,600
days, they'll be more.

1695
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:58,700
okay, so you know how we have the camera space and then there's a

1696
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,800
space outside that we

1697
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,200
See, but entities are still moving when we need to edit that code to

1698
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,700
make it work on vertical floors.

1699
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,200
It's okay.

1700
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:08,900
If you don't get it I may be thinking too far in know, so the answer

1701
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,400
is that there's no difference now between the code that runs in the

1702
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,400
place you can see and the and in the space that you can't see.

1703
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,800
The only difference is, we will probably update the space.

1704
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,200
You can't see less frequently, right?

1705
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,700
But the codes the same.

1706
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,200
So when we write the code for Monsters, moving up and down the

1707
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,900
stairwells, when you can see them, that's the same.

1708
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,400
I'm code they'll use when you can't see them.

1709
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,600
So we won't really have to do anything there.

1710
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,300
Probably.

1711
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,100
Now if we have to optimize, what happens when you can't see them,

1712
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,600
because we need to because it's too slow and we need to get that

1713
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,000
through put up for the non-visible stuff, then we might have to bake

1714
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,700
special concessions, right?

1715
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,800
But until we hit that performance, that hard performance limit, it'll

1716
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,600
just be running the same code so we don't have to worry about it.

1717
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,600
If it works on camera, it will work off camera.

1718
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,600
Would be used to fix discrete animation for moving up and down stairs.

1719
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,900
I'll link to the past, or with the goal, be to make the movement

1720
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,400
seamless, seamless.

1721
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,900
Absolutely.

1722
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,900
I hate it.

1723
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,000
When we, when the movement of my guy is not under my direct control.

1724
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,500
The Kira Sprite will be under your Direct Control at all times, unless

1725
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:27,400
like a monster has grabbed you and and you are not able to move

1726
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,600
because you're being like restrained or something.

1727
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,200
But like none of these candidates.

1728
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,200
Shouldn't on senses like you'll always be in control of the guy

1729
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,300
because it feels awful.

1730
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,400
I hate it when you walk up to a door and like plays this, like go

1731
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,900
through the door animation, especially if I didn't want to go through

1732
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,600
the door and now I have to wait for that.

1733
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,600
Then I have to go into the door.

1734
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,100
And wait, again, when I should just be able to like push back and not

1735
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:48,900
go through the door.

1736
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,800
So yeah, definitely not always seamless.

1737
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,700
That's like a hard requirement always seamless.

1738
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
How much lines of code you have at the moment.

1739
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:17,500
So, Sean blow gave us a thing that we could use to count it, but it's

1740
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:19,000
not very large.

1741
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:22,900
Oops.

1742
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,600
So how you do it?

1743
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,100
It's pretty small 4,500.

1744
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:38,200
So we're we're averaging something like, you know, I guess.

1745
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,600
What's that like 50 lines of an hour, something like that.

1746
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,100
Not particularly much.

1747
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,300
I'm like I said, I gotta explain everything.

1748
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:53,300
So we don't, we don't code very fast on the street.

1749
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,000
Alright, that is the end.

1750
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,700
It looks like the end of the Q and A as well.

1751
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,600
Good deal people.

1752
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:03,700
So, yeah.

1753
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:07,000
So tomorrow, I think we clearly have our work specified for us.

1754
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,900
It's time to like play around with that code and get it working.

1755
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,000
Well, and nicely.

1756
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,800
We're going to have to do something.

1757
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,000
I should, I should put this back to the state that it was in before we

1758
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,100
did our little quote unquote demo there.

1759
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,100
And also, I suppose, I should do inside that same region.

1760
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,500
We had the, did we actually

1761
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:37,100
Didn't we didn't we have our our should Collide thing is kind of

1762
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,400
busted out yet.

1763
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,400
So we have this right here that we need to think about is, well,

1764
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:43,000
right?

1765
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,800
And we need to figure out how we want to do that.

1766
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:51,600
So I guess what we need to say tomorrow is basically like let's let's

1767
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,100
go ahead and

1768
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,600
let's go ahead and say move this back up here.

1769
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,100
We got to sort through our list, may be tomorrow's, a Friday to side

1770
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:01,900
B, good day to do it.

1771
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:07,300
What I would like to do is say 3D Collision detection, working

1772
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:11,700
properly should be something, we should go ahead and actually give our

1773
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,300
guy's Z ranges basically.

1774
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:15,800
So let's do that.

1775
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:17,900
Let's do that tomorrow.

1776
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:18,800
So

1777
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:23,400
That brings us to the end of our handmade hero.

1778
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,500
I'm going to close things down here, and we'll save our Blackboard.

1779
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:28,300
There we go.

1780
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,400
Down down.

1781
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,600
So, thank you everyone for joining me for another episode of handmade

1782
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:37,900
hero.

1783
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,200
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1784
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,700
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

1785
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,900
pre-order the game and it comes with a source code, which you can

1786
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,000
download every night after I'm done coding.

1787
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,400
And of course, we have videos covering every last line of it so you

1788
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:55,100
can learn about absolutely anything that we've done so far and play

1789
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:55,800
around with it yourself.

1790
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,500
It also comes to the test assets I use on the Stream So if you want to

1791
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,700
do that, head over to handmade here at org and the handy dandy

1792
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,200
pre-order button, will hook you up.

1793
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,100
We also have a patreon if you just want to

1794
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:10,300
With the video series, because you are a nice sort of nice, sort of

1795
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:10,800
folks.

1796
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,300
We have a patreon, you can subscribe to that's also linked off there.

1797
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,700
We have a tweet bot.

1798
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,800
Now that tweets the schedule.

1799
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,300
It you.

1800
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:20,600
And that's a pretty handy way to keep informed of when the stream is

1801
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,700
if you want to know ahead of time instead of having to wait for the

1802
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,600
twitch emails, which, you know kind of are at the last minute, the

1803
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,300
tweetbot will tell you what the schedule for the week is and what the

1804
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:31,300
schedule for the day is, so that's pretty handy.

1805
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,200
And then there's the news and forums site, which has a bunch of great

1806
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,600
stuff on it Community maintained its got some good things on there

1807
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,300
like ports to Mac and Linux, if you want to follow along on a

1808
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,900
different platform, you can do that there.

1809
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,600
There's an episode guide.

1810
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:45,600
That's annotated really nice.

1811
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,600
And there's a place to ask questions like a forums thing you can use

1812
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,200
and I answer questions on there as do other people in the community

1813
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,300
who are experienced programmers.

1814
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:54,100
So it's pretty good.

1815
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,500
So I highly recommend checking it out.

1816
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,600
If you try to learn from the stream,

1817
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,600
tomorrow will be early morning, I

1818
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,700
It's Friday, right?

1819
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:02,800
It's a Friday.

1820
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,700
And that means a stream is that 9 a.m.

1821
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:06,700
Pacific Standard time.

1822
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,500
So I don't know if those of you who have, you know, a little breakfast

1823
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,000
coding you might want to do, can join me for that.

1824
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,100
Should be pretty fun.

1825
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,900
So, I hope to see you tomorrow, if not have a wonderful weekend and

1826
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,900
I'll see you back here.

1827
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:21,300
Oh no, I won't.

1828
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:23,600
And that'll be it for for a week.

1829
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,000
Because I said we'd take next week off, if I remember correctly.

1830
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:28,900
Is that right?

1831
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:29,900
First week in March?

1832
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:30,100
Arch.

1833
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,200
Yeah, first remarks.

1834
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,800
So, this will be the first week that I don't see you.

1835
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,500
Well, I'll miss you, but we'll be back here.

1836
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,000
The second week of March, and I hope to see you all back then.

1837
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:41,400
All right?

1838
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:41,700
Take it.

1839
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:42,300
Easy, everyone.
