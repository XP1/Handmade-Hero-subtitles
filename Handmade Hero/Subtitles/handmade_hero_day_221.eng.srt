00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Start recording.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,900
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade here on the show.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,400
We could have complete game live on stream.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,300
We are back after quite some Hiatus.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,000
I was away in San Francisco, working on doing some optimization on the

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,600
witness and then of course, we had handmade Khan and yesterday.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,400
I wanted to give my chance my voice a chance to recover before doing

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
the stream because we were out to like, 2 a.m.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,700
or something after handmade con.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,900
I went to the bar with that people were having sort of the after the

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,100
info.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,800
After party at out of there was probably like 30 or 40 people there

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,000
from handmade kanso.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,200
We were chatting pretty late and my voice was dead by the end of it.

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,100
I was pretty horse on Sunday, but yeah.

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,500
So we are back now and I don't know for those of you who are, maybe

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,200
not who don't follow us on.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,500
Molly rocket.com.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,300
You may have seen this post.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,600
If you, if you were, if you do follow us, if you don't follow us, you

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,100
may have missed it.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,700
Basically, there is a art pack for handmade hero that went up and you

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
should have received an email notification about it.

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,400
Didn't it doesn't really matter because as long as you have your

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,000
download page where you download the code every night and in even if

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,400
you don't, you can go to this lost down, look thing here and do the

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
have it recent thing.

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,100
If you go to that, send out a page, there's now an art pack and you're

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,000
going to need the art pack for a lot of the stuff that we're going to

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,400
be doing on the stream going forwards.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,600
And there, this is the first art pack.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,700
They'll be more and those art what these art packs actually are is,

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,800
they're essentially like art that yangsun's been working on that.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,700
I've packaged up into the format that we

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,000
All designed on the stream so that we can essentially plug them into

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,700
the game and start using actual artwork that we want to use.

37
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,000
So, if you haven't already downloaded that art pack, it's pretty big.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,100
I think it's like a hundred Meg's or something like that.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,600
You're going to want to download that, get that downloading.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,900
And I've actually got it here.

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,000
I absolutely downloaded it.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,500
I've got it here on on my machine, so I'm going to go ahead and grab

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,699
it.

44
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,400
It'll be a little zip file here.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,500
There is a hundred eight megabytes compressed.

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,100
And so if I go in here and I open up my handmade hero directory,

47
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,400
right?

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
You can see that I've got in the in the data directory.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
We've got these hhas.

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,300
Remember, they're the things that we made to test out our system and

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,800
what's in this intro are, as you can see, is it's another, it's one of

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
those packaged hhas, right?

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,200
So all I'm going to do is, I'm just going to unzip this into this

54
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
directory.

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,700
So that now I've got the

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,900
Aha that we distributed that's the art pack and you can see, once I

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,900
decompress, it's pretty big, it's about half a gig, right?

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,700
So that's just a bunch of art from Yankton that I packed up in there.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
And what we're going to do today is I'm going to talk a little bit

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,100
about that and just kind of show you what's in there and discuss what

61
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,100
we're going to do with it.

62
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,900
So that you kind of

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,900
so, you can kind of have

64
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,200
All about perspective on what's going on there.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Okay, so it's a first day back.

66
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
We were right in the middle of doing some, debug code.

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,700
I'm going to put that to aside aside for just one second so we can

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,900
talk about this stuff.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,000
And the reason for that is it's like, we've been away for so long now.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,800
I don't feel like there's any particular need for continuity because

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,300
there's, I mean, yeah, we've been away so long that anything that you

72
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300
were thinking about, you've definitely paged out at this point.

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,600
I know I certainly have.

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,600
And so what I want to do is just kind of talk about this art Paxton

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Out here now and I want to get it in and just kind of show you how to

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,300
work with it.

77
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Especially if people want to play around with it on their own just so

78
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,000
they know what's going on.

79
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,300
All right.

80
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,900
So now if you remember correctly, I'm going to go ahead and build our

81
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,000
game and just run it here.

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,500
If you remember correctly, hhas are automatically loaded by our game

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,700
engine, right?

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,800
So when we run the game, it's going to automatically go.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
It's going to automatically load that ha because it's in the data

86
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
directory, right?

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,700
And it's going to automatically load them all.

88
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,700
So basically what happens is that ha gets picked up just

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,200
automatically.

90
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,800
We don't add any code for it to already load it and consider it.

91
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,100
Do and all the things in it active, right?

92
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,300
But what I had to do, obviously, when I made the data pack is, it's

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,200
got stuff in it that we hadn't named yet.

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,500
And if you remember the way that we kind of named things in our in our

95
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,400
asset system, right, I actually think it's in file formats, that H is

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,900
we've got sort of these asset tags and we've got these asset types,

97
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,600
right?

98
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,500
And the asset tags in the asset types are things that we use to

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800
identify assets in the game, so that we can load.

100
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Them.

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
And so, what I had to do is I had to add new assets types in order to

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
say like what the right things were there as packing and basically

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,300
what I did is I added asset like opening cutscene right, which is a

104
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,800
place that we store a sort of information that that it goes with our

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
opening cutscene.

106
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,100
And also, you know, similar to that.

107
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,200
I added a tag shot index and a tag layer Index, right?

108
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,700
And so what, these were, the way I decided to do it.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,700
Let me just give you a little bit of an idea on how the breakdown

110
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,300
worked here is.

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,800
What I did is I said well, okay, here's a day.

112
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,900
221 is I said, okay, you know, it's this supposed to be a real game,

113
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,100
right?

114
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,200
Like I said, professional quality game, professional quality games,

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
have cut scenes in them.

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,900
Write a little intro cutscene to kind of like, set the mood or

117
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,200
whatever or that plays during the attract mode before you start

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,000
playing the game.

119
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,400
So we kind of have one of those and that seems like the most logical

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,700
thing to put into the game first.

121
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,200
Because in terms of programming, it kind of gives us a way to kind of

122
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,000
get our feet wet, right?

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Because it kind of gives a way to do some very simple animation work.

124
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,400
But before we try to start doing the harder core animation stuff,

125
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,700
which is like when you know entities in the game or actually like

126
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
interacting with other entities, there's a lot more logic there.

127
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,900
It's not it's not a pre-scripted thing, right?

128
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,800
So a cutscene

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
Usually easier, at least in a 2d game.

130
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Certainly it's usually easier to code the the stuff that's necessary

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
to support a cutscene than it is to code.

132
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,900
The stuff that's necessary to support the in-game interactions which

133
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,200
are all going to be certainly more Dynamic and less predictable and

134
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,500
all that sort of thing, right?

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,600
So I started with the cutscenes because that I thought would be the

136
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,500
easiest thing for us to program and then we'll kind of move on from

137
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:24,700
there.

138
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,900
So the art packs will kind of be like cutscenes first and then you

139
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,800
know entities and scenery coming in.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
A future packs.

141
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,900
So this is like the cutscene art

142
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,400
And the cutscene art is structured in the following fashion, like any

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
cutscene, there's a series of shots.

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,800
So essentially we have the notion that there's like, you know, shot

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,900
one shot, two shot 3, and so on up to shot in, right?

146
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,300
Which is the last shot and these are essentially like things that will

147
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,300
be showing on the screen.

148
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,100
You can imagine them as a little, you know, pictures that were going

149
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,800
to show on the screen for part of our cut seam in normally maybe you

150
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,100
know,

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
All we wanted to do was just show a still image.

152
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,000
Like, you know, here's the little handmade hero guy and he's got his

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,900
little glove there and he's like, let's do this, right?

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,200
If we want to do something like that, then we would just have a single

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,000
bitmap and we just put it on the screen and we'd be done right but

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,700
that's kind of lame.

157
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,400
So what I want to do is do a little bit more of an interesting style

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,700
for the cutscene, which is to say, I wanted to have multiple layers

159
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,500
that kind of did look a little bit of a parallax, same thing, right?

160
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
And so what I did is I had Yang should draw out so that basically each

161
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,400
shot consists of a series of layers, right?

162
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,100
So for shot one, we've actually got like layer 1 layer 2, you know.

163
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,500
Oops.

164
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Layer 3 and these are designed to be composite on top of each other.

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
So you know, if you've got this sort of a thing maybe the handmade

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Hero guys in the front maybe then there's like the orphanage of the

167
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,600
back and then maybe there's some like Hills or something.

168
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,600
And that way we can kind of have a slow sort of Zoom pan effect

169
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,300
happening where you get a little bit of nice Parallax in there.

170
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,700
You get a little bit of nice depth to the image, right?

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
And it really just makes the cut scene.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Look a lot more professional and interesting as compared to just

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,900
sticking a single, you know, image up on the screen, which isn't

174
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100
really going to

175
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,300
You two look like at the Quality level, that we might like to have for

176
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,800
a professional game, right?

177
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,800
Just it's kind of a mature in my opinion.

178
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,400
So you should be able to know how to program something like this.

179
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
So that's the way I made it.

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,700
And so what I did was I said, okay, all of our assets that are

181
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,100
involved in the opening cutscene will just get asset opening cutscene

182
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,600
as their asset category and then they'll be tagged with two things,

183
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,900
one will be the shot index and one will be the layer index.

184
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,000
And so basically, what you could do is you can pull out

185
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,700
Out any given shot and layer by just saying, I would like the best

186
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,400
match for opening cutscene for this shot, this layer and it will give

187
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,100
you back that one and off you go.

188
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
So, the reason we asserted in here, right?

189
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
Like, when I ran at the first time,

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,700
Is because our asset count is actually going to be higher than the,

191
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,700
than the allowed number right.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The allowed number is just going to be whatever we said before, and I

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
insert a new one.

194
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,400
So that's going to hit the assertion.

195
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
Say, hey, wait a minute, there's more than they're supposed to be than

196
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,400
what I understand like, what's going on, right?

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
So if I recompile it now, we should be fine.

198
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,600
And now, you can see that our game is running as we would expect it to

199
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,300
run, like it was before, and now we're loading that ha up now,

200
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,800
remember we do all of our loading on demand and so that ha

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Aha, it's not actually loading.

202
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,300
Half a gigabyte of data especially on a system like this, which is

203
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,500
running on a conventional, hard drive, 7200 RPM hard drive, not a

204
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,800
modern solid state drive with fast transfer speeds.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,200
There's no way it would have loaded 5, 500 megabytes in an instant,

206
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,400
right?

207
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,100
You can see, when I run this at pretty much.

208
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,200
It's instant, right.

209
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,100
And it starts up immediately, it couldn't do that.

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,400
And it's so, again, it's not.

211
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,100
I just want to reinforce that, I guess not actually loading the HSA.

212
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
It's just loading the header of the age of 2, h, a and so that it

213
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,000
knows what assets are in it.

214
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,400
And it's doing the merge with the other.

215
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,800
Aha.

216
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,600
So it has a single asset table that it can use, but it's not actually

217
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,200
loading it.

218
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,500
It won't load the actual bitmap data till we go to try and use it.

219
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Now, that's exactly what I'd like to do.

220
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,600
Now, for the rest of the stream, I'd like to try just loading in some

221
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,000
of that data show you what's in there and what I mean by that

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,900
multi-layered stuff.

223
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,000
So we'll try to get a little bit of that working on the stream today.

224
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,700
So if I go to handmade dot CPP, the first thing I want to check is, I

225
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,500
don't remember what kind of asset workspace.

226
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,100
We're starting in right now.

227
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,600
So when we do you know create game assets or whatever it is, this this

228
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,000
if you remember like we kind of have a little asset manager system

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,300
thing here, that takes care of our asset loading for us.

230
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,800
This this function right here that we call.

231
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,500
We pass it.

232
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,800
How much we expect it to be able to use for storing those assets.

233
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
And if you take a look, what we did is we set that number 216 and

234
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,300
that's pretty good for testing.

235
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,500
And we probably want to do that because you probably asked bugs in our

236
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,300
asset system.

237
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,700
So in the future, we're going to want to test that a low.

238
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,800
Number certainly just a bulletproof or two.

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,900
But at the moment that is much too low, because if we're at 1080p, I

240
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,200
just want to again, get you in the habit of doing some of this math

241
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,300
and thinking, about this way, if we're at 1080p right, which is where

242
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,300
I wanted yangshin to Target.

243
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,300
So we kind of, when we did the art, we made sure.

244
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,900
They would be good at 1080p.

245
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,300
So if you have 1080 P, that's a 1920 by 1080 screen, right?

246
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,600
And of course it's it's going to be RGB and Alpha channel.

247
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,000
So it's four bytes per pixel.

248
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,800
That means every one of these layers,

249
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,400
Layers could potentially be at least that big.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,300
And if there's, if it's got some bleed, if it's got some ability to

251
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,000
like pan, it could be even bigger than that, right?

252
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,700
But just to give you a little perspective on that 1920 by 1080 times

253
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,900
for a take a look at that number, right?

254
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,500
That's that's actually eight megabytes right there.

255
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,600
And so with 16 MB, we wouldn't even be able to load in probably one

256
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,100
cutscene.

257
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
It would, it wouldn't even be able to load a single frame because

258
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,700
there isn't even enough memory there to load in just

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Set of layers.

260
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,700
So we really do need this to be something more like a working set of

261
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,900
like you know something more reasonable.

262
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,900
It could be more like that, right?

263
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:13,200
That's certainly plenty because if you do 25th divided by 8, that's 32

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
cutscene layers, you can probably get by with that.

265
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,100
We might want more but you get the idea, right?

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
So if that's what we're doing with our game assets, that gives us a

267
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,900
little bit more leeway, that wouldn't change anything in the running

268
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,200
here, it just means that.

269
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Now, the asset system won't have to thrash, right?

270
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:29,900
And like

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
I said, we will want to set that down to lower numbers.

272
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,900
It will expose bugs in our asset system because we haven't really

273
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
tested the asset system yet.

274
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,700
So we will want to do stuff like that but this just now is not the

275
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,900
appropriate time for it while we're working on another system.

276
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,700
We can assume that the asset system works properly for now even though

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,100
we know we probably want to do some heavier testing on it to actually

278
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,200
get the bugs out of it but we don't care about that.

279
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
We just care that the interface is what it is and and so that we can

280
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,100
read the stuff to it.

281
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,500
So we've upgraded that a little bit

282
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,700
And that's all good.

283
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,900
But now we want to do some of this cutscene coating.

284
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,000
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to go ahead and just make a

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,600
little handmade cutscene file just because this is stuff that really

286
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,800
isn't going to affect anything else in the game.

287
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,000
And so I'm just going to kind of stick it over here so it doesn't get

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,700
in my way.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,500
What I'm doing stuff again.

290
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,200
A lot of people ask me stuff about how you divide stuff into files and

291
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
the answer is, it's just your own personal convenience.

292
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,500
I always compile everything into one single translation unit anyway or

293
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,000
if I have to, I break it up into, you know, two or three.

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,300
If I

295
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Absolutely have to.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
But in general, I think is one translation unit, and so files are all

297
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,500
mushed together at the end.

298
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,900
Anyway, so really this is just because I just don't want this stuff

299
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,700
clogging up my the rest of my code.

300
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm just going to squirrel it away here.

301
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,800
So what we're going to do is again I'm not going to try to

302
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
overcomplicate this at the start.

303
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going to start as if I've never written a cutscene before.

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm just going to go with the basics and then I'll show you as we go

305
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
some things that we're going to kind of want to start pulling out of

306
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
it again, compression oriented programming approach there.

307
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
Just some things, we want to start pulling out to make it easier on

308
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
ourselves to write these sorts of things.

309
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
All right, so the first thing I do is is the absolute.

310
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,700
Most basic thing we could possibly want to do, which is just take the

311
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,900
first shot and render all the layers, right?

312
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,600
That's it.

313
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
That's all I want to do.

314
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,700
And so what I'd like to start with, is say okay let's go ahead in here

315
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,200
and do like just render cutscene or something.

316
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't even know what it's going to be called and then we're just

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
going to go ahead and do the same kind of rendering that we've been

318
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,300
doing everywhere else where you can kind of see this sort of stuff

319
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Happening Here, Right?

320
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,400
All the sort of things we were doing, so what?

321
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,200
Going to want to do is is, is basically set up everything for the

322
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,100
cutscene render.

323
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
So when we do this, we're going to need the render group obviously

324
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,800
because the render groups the thing that allows us to actually push

325
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,700
stuff on there.

326
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,800
We're going to need stuff like the transient state that like the asset

327
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,300
like the game assets, right?

328
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,200
So we're going to need stuff like that.

329
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,600
and then we're going to have to do is when we get in there, we're

330
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,100
going to have to do things like setting up what we expect our lens to

331
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,800
be right, like how we expect

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,900
To view stuff and we're going to have to set up.

333
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,700
We're going to have to make draw calls to basically like get assets.

334
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,000
We want like this sort of thing here, right?

335
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,700
We're going to have to do something like that, and we're going to have

336
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,000
to actually push it to the renderer, right?

337
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,600
So I'm just grabbing the code that we have, like, so this is really

338
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,100
all the sorts of stuff that we're going to be needing to do.

339
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,100
So, let's take a look at what we've got here.

340
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
When we pass through the render group here, we

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Add the draw by first to know what the width and height is, right of

342
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,300
the drop off your stuff.

343
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,600
So I need one more thing which is just the draw before I believe

344
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
that's a bitmap right yet.

345
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,000
So I thought

346
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,900
Like so and so what we're going to do here is say, alright, let's

347
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,000
settle this stuff up.

348
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,200
We've got M to pixels and I don't know what we want to do with me.

349
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,900
Those two pixels here.

350
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,200
This is a little bit weird.

351
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,900
We I feel like we've always kind of danced around that a little bit

352
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,500
and it's just kind of a little bit a little bit janky, right.

353
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,300
You can kind of see like like this is the stuff is kind of a little

354
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,800
bit weird the way that it works and I don't super love it.

355
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,200
So I think we may put it to do in here.

356
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,100
Say like, you know, unify this stuff because I feel like we kind of

357
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,400
need to unify it with this and you know just kind of like figure out

358
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,800
exactly how we wanted that to be treated, right?

359
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,800
But anyway,

360
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,100
In here, once we've got this stuff set up and we can play with this a

361
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,700
little bit later.

362
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
Like I said, remember this is the code we just said like okay, how big

363
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,700
is the Monitor and M?

364
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,900
How big is our our draw buffer width.

365
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
Okay that's how big that's going to be in terms of how big a meter

366
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,300
should be on the screen or whatever it is.

367
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,400
Right, that sort of stuff and that's really kind of just going to be

368
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,400
fixed based on our preferences and and our testing.

369
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:47,900
Right?

370
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,000
But anyway so taking a look at this stuff.

371
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,200
What we have to do now is go, all right, we want to load these things.

372
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Out and you can see we've got you know are matched Vector weight

373
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,700
Vector, if your member how these things work we just say all right I

374
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,500
want to pull something out of the asset system.

375
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,400
I give it a vector that kind of describes what's going on and it just

376
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,900
does a best-case match.

377
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Again we probably have some work to do on that sort of thing in the

378
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,200
future but for now it's going to be totally fine.

379
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,599
The work we have to do in the future, is basically to accelerate these

380
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,099
things will probably have to compress the asset Vector because as we

381
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,099
get more tags, but that's a separate issue.

382
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,000
So anyway, if we have an asset Vector system here I'm going to want to

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,900
be drawing a bunch of these, right?

384
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,500
So I'm just going to make a for I Loop here where we just go through

385
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,100
and we grab out layers sequentially and we put them on the screen,

386
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:34,800
right?

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And so we can see exactly how we would do this, right?

388
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,700
We got to create our match Vector in our thing, we've got for a match

389
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,000
victory.

390
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,300
In a weight Vector, we have our shot index and our layer index are the

391
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
two things that we're going to want to do.

392
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,700
And that's just literally going to be something like this, right?

393
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Where we set them.

394
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,900
and then our weight Vector is again going to be

395
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,200
Back.

396
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,700
Same thing.

397
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,400
We just want to look at those two things evenly.

398
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
We'd like to get them back.

399
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,800
Exactly.

400
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,300
And I assume we always want something from the right shot, right?

401
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,300
So we're going to want that to obviously be heavily weighted and then

402
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,800
we want the layers but really we could leave us like this because

403
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
we're only ever going to be asking thing for things that match

404
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,600
exactly.

405
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,400
We never need it to really like, you know, find something else.

406
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,800
But if we were really being honest about it, we could imagine doing

407
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
something like this so that it wouldn't pick it up.

408
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,200
It it's that's this is really it's really too stupid because we're

409
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,900
never actually,

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,700
By using the fuzzy matching capabilities of the system, we're always

411
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,500
going to be asking for a very specific thing.

412
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,900
All right, so if we imagine something in here, we're just going to say

413
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,600
that we have a particular shot index and that shot in so say is one of

414
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
the very first shot.

415
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,900
I decided to not call the first shot 04.

416
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,200
The figured shot.0 might indicate like the null shot.

417
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,400
Like if you're trying to say there, we're not talking about a shot.

418
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,600
So then from there we've got layers.

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,000
And what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to do a layer index.

420
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,900
I'm gonna only just pull out just a very first layer like,

421
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,800
First layer of the that shot and we're going to render just that one,

422
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,300
right?

423
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,000
So we're going to do something that looks like this, we're going to

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,700
say, okay, here's my pic map, ID, or whatever it is.

425
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm going to say, give me the best match bitmap from the asset set.

426
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,800
I want you to load the opening cutscene, that matches this weight

427
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Vector, right?

428
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,300
And I'm going to move this guy in here as well.

429
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
So we update it every time, right?

430
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,300
We could probably do something like that.

431
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,400
And then I'm going to draw it, right?

432
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,000
And I'm just going to draw it right in the center of the screen.

433
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Nothing particularly fancy there.

434
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm just going to literally draw it.

435
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,100
You know, layer image like so.

436
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
That's all I'm going to do.

437
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
So that's my render cutscene call.

438
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,400
When I compile remember, this file is not actually being compiled yet

439
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,900
so I have to add it to the build.

440
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,800
Remember, this is a single translation unit build, so I can literally

441
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,400
do that by just coming in here and saying, all right, and made

442
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,100
cutscene dot CPP is now smushed directly into my main file and now

443
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,800
it's being compiled and hey, we didn't have any compile errors.

444
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,500
Look at us syntax Masters, but we're not actually calling this yet.

445
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,000
So if I ran the code, as you expect doesn't actually,

446
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,800
Do anything?

447
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,500
So if I wanted to do something, I would have to go in here and

448
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
actually render the cutscene.

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,700
Now, what I can do is say, alright, you can go ahead and render all

450
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,100
the stuff under the cutscene, all you want.

451
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,300
And then I'll just run to the thing on top of it.

452
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,900
But since the cutscene is going to be pretty heavy hitting for our

453
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,800
render system because lots of stuff layered on top of each other.

454
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
I don't really want the render it up, spent time running other stuff.

455
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,100
So I think I'm going to do at this point is start to sort of bifurcate

456
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,200
this code a little bit and put the other stuff into a separate piece

457
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
of code, right?

458
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,800
So I'm just going to say, all right, as we do this stuff where we have

459
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,500
like a socket render group and we do the begin renderer at that sort

460
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,100
of stuff.

461
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,400
I'm just going to come in here and say, all right, here's render.

462
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Cutscene will go ahead and put render cutscene in.

463
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,200
Here like this.

464
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,400
And then this stuff is going to be something else, right?

465
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm going to take all this stuff.

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm going to

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Just be something else entirely.

468
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,500
So, all of this stuff that happens here, everything right up until the

469
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,900
point where we actually flush the render system, right?

470
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,100
Which would basically be like right here.

471
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Why do we render before we flush the Sim region?

472
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,300
Is that does anyone know why we're doing that?

473
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,300
I don't know why we're doing that.

474
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
But okay, that's a bit weird.

475
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,400
And I'm going to change that right now because that doesn't make any

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:38,800
sense.

477
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,600
All right, so point, being that's just weird.

478
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,800
And I'm going to figure out why we did that maybe there was a very

479
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,600
good reason for it.

480
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
I don't know if there was or not, but we're going to find out in a

481
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,800
second because I don't think that should be happening, but maybe

482
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,400
there's a reason

483
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
That that has to do with like, how things were ordered or I don't even

484
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,200
know.

485
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,700
So, I guess, we'll find out.

486
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
We'll find out in a minute.

487
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Probably should have put a comment in there.

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,700
It was like, Hey, warning, don't move this.

489
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,100
If in fact, it actually needs to be moved or rather couldn't be moved

490
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,000
since I didn't.

491
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm just gonna go ahead and do it.

492
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
And we'll find out later.

493
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,300
Alright, so I'm going to just go ahead and get that working and we're

494
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,500
going to call this, you know, rendered game or something like that,

495
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,300
right?

496
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,600
And we're going to see what it needs.

497
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,500
So it needs the game state.

498
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,300
And it probably needs the trance State as well.

499
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,700
And we'll see if that's enough.

500
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,000
It needs the world.

501
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,000
The world I think is just game State worlds.

502
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,800
Yeah, it is.

503
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,400
So it doesn't really need to get that passed to it for the most part,

504
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,700
right?

505
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,200
I can just make that be something that it grabs out of what it gets.

506
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,100
Let's see what else it needs.

507
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,700
Input.

508
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,300
So it needs some input.

509
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,800
That would be lets see render game.

510
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,700
This would be actually update and render game for being honest with

511
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,300
ourselves.

512
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,600
So, this is game input.

513
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,600
is not cold game, but I think it is

514
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:18,900
Right.

515
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,500
Yeah, and mouse p is something that can just be gotten from the game

516
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,700
input, if I remember correctly, right?

517
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,000
Yeah, so that actually can just be moved in.

518
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,800
Yeah, yeah.

519
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm just gonna go ahead and move that up because nobody else needs it.

520
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,700
So again, really, all I'm doing is pulling this code out because

521
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,600
that's it really was our game, our render game and we never, we just

522
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,500
kind of left it in there because we could.

523
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,100
And so we,

524
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,500
It.

525
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,400
Alright.

526
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,800
So, render memory is an Undeclared identifier that makes sense because

527
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
that was something that we actually did out here.

528
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,800
and so, hopefully that all

529
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Up now properly.

530
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,000
Yeah.

531
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Alright so I'm going to see if that works.

532
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Let's take out let's we're not actually doing the cutscene now.

533
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,200
I'm just going to do render game.

534
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,100
Or rather update and render game.

535
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
So just go to call that now and see if we still have our game, right?

536
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,300
I'm just going to make sure that I extracted that code properly and

537
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,500
didn't mess something up.

538
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,700
When I pulled it out because you know, you never do know.

539
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Things are getting fairly complicated in here as we get more and more

540
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
of our engine stuff together.

541
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,800
You end up with a situation where, you know, you could easily break

542
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,400
something that you hadn't really thought too hard about before, right?

543
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
Alright, so there we go.

544
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,500
So this is the just as we're cleaning up, our temporary memory stuff.

545
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,900
it looks like what happened here is again, there's cuz as we sort of

546
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,000
end our memory stuff

547
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,700
I feel like, where does the memory?

548
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,000
Where does the memory stuff actually happen?

549
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,700
If that should happen before checking the arena.

550
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,400
So that actually should happen here right?

551
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Because what happens is where do we get our temporary render memory?

552
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
We get it right here.

553
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,400
So we get the temporary memory for the renderer here which kind of

554
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,200
pushes that onto that sort of stack of temporary memory.

555
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,900
We do a bunch of stuff and then we end our temperature.

556
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,900
A remember here for it inside, update game and render.

557
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,300
It's going to it's going to get SIM memory and then release system

558
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,800
memory.

559
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,200
So I feel like that should have been work because they are nested

560
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,900
properly but don't actually know yes.

561
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,500
That was just because I that was just because these check Arena calls

562
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,700
need to come after the temporary memory stuff had happened and we

563
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
hadn't done that.

564
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,800
So that was a, that was incorrect.

565
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,100
So there we go.

566
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,300
So now if I want to switch from a game to our cutscene, I should be

567
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,200
able to just do that, right?

568
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,700
And now if I run this code in theory I should be in that that cutscene

569
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,500
rendering code.

570
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,900
And so now we can start working on the cutscene rendering code in the

571
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,500
goal is to get like you know a little bit of a cut scene on a scene

572
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,900
here on the screen here and we've got

573
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
Got 30 minutes to do it.

574
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,100
So hopefully that won't be too terribly difficult.

575
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,800
But who knows, right.

576
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,600
All right, so let's see.

577
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,200
The first thing we want to do is we want to make sure that we're

578
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,800
actually getting back a bit map here that were actually able to load,

579
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,800
you know, something that we can draw, right?

580
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,000
So, what I want to do is I want to step into the code and I want to

581
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,700
see.

582
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,800
I want to make sure that in render cutscene, that were actually

583
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,100
getting back a bitmap that we could actually draw, right?

584
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,200
So, let's see what that comes back.

585
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,700
As

586
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
So that is an actual bitmap and then here, we're going to go ahead and

587
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,900
push that bitmap on, so hopefully, it'll be able to actually do that.

588
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,200
You know what I'm going to do, I'm going to step to it here.

589
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,200
So in theory, if we come through here, we should be able to go.

590
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,600
If it stops showing me bunch of Constructors for things, we should be

591
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,100
able to draw that bitmap and let's see what we get.

592
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,600
Okay, so there's that height.

593
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh,

594
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,400
Well, probably won't see anything.

595
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,000
If I pass a height of 0, I probably need to pass the height that I

596
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,300
actually want this thing to be for the moment.

597
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,400
We'll just pass 10, which is just an arbitrary hide.

598
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,000
I made up

599
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
Hey look, it's our bitmap.

600
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,300
I gotta cross make the screen larger enough to see it.

601
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,800
So there is just a layer again, doesn't really make any sense because

602
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,900
we're only seeing one of them and I don't really know how big I want

603
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,100
it.

604
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,200
But of course thanks to the live Loop live coding.

605
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,000
We actually don't even really need to make much in the way of tools

606
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,400
for this creating this cutscene because I can just sort of you know go

607
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,600
ahead and do something like this where I just create oh

608
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
There or not.

609
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,800
What did I do wrong there?

610
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,100
I just change the height.

611
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Strings are equal.

612
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
Broke their interesting.

613
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,300
So it looks like we have a wee look.

614
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,000
Looks like we have a bug in our debug stuff for which is not

615
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,100
surprising because we weren't done with it with looped, let with our

616
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,700
left coded thing stuff, so that's that's actually fine because I don't

617
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
care about it at the moment.

618
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,400
So since we were in the middle of that, I'm just going to

619
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,500
Leave that for now and go ahead and turn off handmade internal so that

620
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,100
we can continue what we're doing.

621
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,000
So, there we go.

622
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,600
All right, so back to what I was saying here is our thing I want to

623
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,900
just make it get sort of a little bit bigger.

624
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,200
I want it to kind of take up a little bit more of the screen if that

625
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,700
makes sense.

626
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,400
So that it kind of that back layer kind of occupies the entire space

627
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,900
if that makes sense, right?

628
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say alright let's say

629
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,800
that's just 14 units.

630
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,700
High here, I'm just adjusting the layer to it fits, right?

631
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,100
So that looks pretty good.

632
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,200
So maybe now I'll just say like, okay, let's

633
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,100
See what happens if we load two layers in a composite them on top of

634
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,400
each other.

635
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,900
There we go.

636
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,100
There's a little light there.

637
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,500
I'm going to add three layers and composite them on top and that's

638
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,700
like too big.

639
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,800
So that layer clearly needs to be like sized and placed a little bit

640
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,000
differently, but I can keep going like this until I get all the layers

641
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,500
of the shot on there.

642
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,100
And you'll notice that this first shot is the familiar one that you've

643
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,500
seen many times before, I think there's only eight layers in it.

644
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,100
Like there's no, I don't think there's any layers passed that one.

645
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,400
Yes.

646
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,200
Oh, that's that's all the layers in it.

647
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
You can see it's kind of morphine.

648
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,500
Just now like action did some polishing on on.

649
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,100
It's a little more detail than the one that we use for the backdrop of

650
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,800
that sort of stuff.

651
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,800
But we kind of we have all those layers on there and that's all well

652
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
and good, right?

653
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,100
So hopefully you understood all that we didn't do anything,

654
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,800
particularly resting.

655
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
All we're doing is taking these and rendering them through our

656
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,400
renderer and and yeah, and that's about it.

657
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,600
What I would like to do now is start to work on the on that sort of

658
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,500
again, placement and movement that sort of

659
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,000
That's sort of basic stuff that we want to do with a cutscene, okay?

660
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,800
So let me see that went a lot faster.

661
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,900
I was kind of expecting that to be what we did today, but that's

662
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,000
already on the screen.

663
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
So I can't really make the be that what we did today because we got 30

664
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,900
minutes of me sitting

665
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
I'm going.

666
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
That's what we did today.

667
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,400
That's not very interesting.

668
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,600
So I'm going to jump right into the discussion of exactly what's going

669
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,100
on with that particular sort of cutscene situation.

670
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
So like I said, this is what we've got here, right?

671
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,700
We've got a cutscene and as you can see, it's got layers one through

672
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,100
layer 8, right?

673
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,800
So essentially we've got something that looks like this, right?

674
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,900
2, 3 4.

675
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,100
And so on all the way up to number eight and they're all getting

676
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,900
composited together.

677
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Whether I don't know what our frame rate is right now, actually, but

678
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,300
we could kind of test that by having a thing that allows us to kind of

679
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,200
move it around a little bit.

680
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Or I guess if I went and fixed the bug in the debug system, I could

681
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
see what the frame rate was but I don't really care at the moment.

682
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,000
So I think our render might actually handle this.

683
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Many layers was kind of crazy but that's just the way it goes

684
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,000
sometimes computers because they're so darn fast.

685
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,300
But point being this is what we're trying to put together.

686
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,900
Now each of these layers is something that we want to

687
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
Out of position in space, right?

688
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,000
Because what we're trying to do with this is simulate, the fact that

689
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,200
we have some sort of perspective in our scene.

690
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,900
Now, we talked about this, a bunch.

691
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,300
We talked about this before when we did our sort of stuff where the

692
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,100
hero kind of goes up a level, and we wanted to kind of zoom in and

693
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,200
out, but just to recap, what's going on here, right?

694
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,000
We have looking for the top down now, right?

695
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,800
This is the monitor right here and here is our eyeball, right?

696
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,600
There's our little eyeball looking at it.

697
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,600
What we want to see is we want to see that things in the background so

698
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,700
layers that are back here and layers that are in the front here.

699
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,000
We want to simulate that perspective foreshortening effect where

700
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,900
layers that are in the background as we might move.

701
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,000
So if we move forwards, we want layers here to become bigger at a

702
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
rate, that's faster than layers that come here, we already built that

703
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,500
into our system by having Z depths, right?

704
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,600
So what I want to do is I want to make the z-depth.

705
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,200
I want to be able to change these Z depths that we have

706
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,300
So that each individual layer has a different Z depth and so that when

707
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,600
we pan or Zoom, the camera in and out, we get different perspective

708
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,500
effects, right?

709
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,200
So, the first thing I need to do there is, I need to create some

710
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,000
notion of a camera movement that will happen over time, okay?

711
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,300
And so, what I'm going to do to do that, right?

712
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,500
You know, I just need some space to store it again.

713
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,200
I don't care where that is right now but as

714
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,200
As we sort of think about these cutscenes a little more.

715
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,100
We're going to kind of pull that out into a little bit more of a

716
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,300
concrete notion of what's happening.

717
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,000
But what I can do for the moment, you just say, okay, we've got a game

718
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,800
State here.

719
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
So all I'm going to do is introduce something temporarily down at the

720
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,100
bottom, which is like cutscene time and that's going to be a timer

721
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,800
that we can drive our cutscene time from right.

722
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,500
And so in here, what I will do is say like maybe when we do this

723
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,800
render cutscene maybe I'll just pass that in, right?

724
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
So we'll say what the cutscene time is.

725
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
And what I'd like to do is say wherever

726
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,300
Camera is like when we're doing this sort of thing that distance above

727
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,600
Grant, I'm just going to slowly Zoom the camera so that it gets less

728
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,100
than nine away, right?

729
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
So that the 0 plane is nine away.

730
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,500
I don't know why we picked nine that was just what we had before.

731
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,400
I'm going to say that you know, maybe we'll even just call it 10 for

732
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
now because who cares?

733
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
We're just going to set all this up based on that.

734
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
Initial number anyway, doesn't matter what you said it too because I

735
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,500
do anything.

736
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,700
I'm just going to make it so we Zoom between two numbers, right?

737
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,300
So as this cutscene time goes and it's cutting time is obviously in s.

738
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
We're always using S for our time.

739
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,400
So as our cutscene time goes up what I'd like to do is I'd like to

740
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:42,600
smoothly very the the distance above the ground based on that cutscene

741
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,800
time.

742
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:46,800
So what I'm going to do is I'm introduced to boundary variables for

743
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,300
this particular thing which is like cutscene start, right?

744
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,800
And that's going to be 0 0 and cutscene end.

745
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,000
And I'm going to say that that's like over

746
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
No five seconds or something.

747
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm just picking a number randomly here and then I'm going to map this

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,400
cutscene time into that range and so I believe we already have some

749
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:05,900
routine.

750
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,900
We wrote that map's things into a link or a range.

751
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,400
You can see here, clamp, 01 map to range and what I'm going to do is

752
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,100
I'm just going to take that and I'm going to produce that clamp T

753
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,400
value.

754
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,699
Now remember, what this does, you can pass it in a minimum bound and a

755
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,800
maximum bounds like so.

756
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,100
And then you pass in what the actual value is that you're looking at,

757
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,900
which is our cutscene time like, so, oops, that should be capitalized.

758
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,500
Perhaps,

759
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,500
We'll just put in here.

760
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:46,199
Thank you to Ron Gilbert and friends for introducing the word cutscene

761
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,199
into the game development vocabulary.

762
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,699
Since he was at Camp, handmade con.

763
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,000
I think it's only right to give him and his team credit for

764
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
introducing that term.

765
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,400
They as he said at the conference, he was not the first person to do

766
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,800
an interstitial in a game, but they were the people who coined the

767
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,000
term cutscene, so, there you go.

768
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,700
Alright, so here we go, is cut scene.

769
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,600
Goes basically what we're going to do here.

770
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,600
Is going to take that time, going to map it into our range.

771
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,400
So now we'll get it.

772
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,500
We're going to have here, this is like our normalized T.

773
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,300
We now have a Time Value, right?

774
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
And now you know what, I should probably be consistent here.

775
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Let's just call that t cutscene T.

776
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Start

777
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,500
The end.

778
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,800
And I kind of like that for some reason.

779
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
So let's just do it like that.

780
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,000
And now we have a value that ranges from 0 to 1 that tells us where we

781
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,500
are in our cutscene.

782
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,200
And so our distance above ground could just be like whatever it's 10

783
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,800
meters away - you know it goes, you know 5 m forwards over the course

784
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,200
of the zoom right?

785
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,800
so, as this

786
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,300
Up that will happen for now.

787
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:09,000
I would like to kind of mod the, the value so that it wraps around and

788
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,100
we don't really have a good way to do that, but I could do something

789
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,100
like, you know, you know right here.

790
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,600
Do we have modulus

791
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Don't know that we do.

792
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,200
I don't think we do intrinsic modulus.

793
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:34,000
You do not have an F mod, it would appear at least as far as I could

794
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,500
tell.

795
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,600
Yeah, I'm not seeing it, not seeing it.

796
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,000
So, you know, that's just the way it goes sometimes babe.

797
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,300
So, yeah.

798
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,100
So, I don't know what to do.

799
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,900
Exactly there.

800
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,600
Maybe we'll do something like this, so we can wrap the cutscene

801
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,000
number.

802
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't actually think we need to do that.

803
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Lets just ignore this for now.

804
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Let's pretend.

805
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,300
It never happened, doesn't really matter point, being, that will give

806
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,400
us that zoom over time.

807
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,800
So all we have to do now is go ahead and actually use these values.

808
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,000
So, what we do render cutscene, we can pass it.

809
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,000
Game State cutscene time.

810
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,600
Like so and then we can just update the cutscene time.

811
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,600
With however much elapsed, right?

812
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,900
So I'm just running a simple timer and and I'm just advancing the

813
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
cutscene as we go.

814
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I don't know where we compute, there it is.

815
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,800
So you don't know where we have that value but there we go.

816
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,200
And what I want to do is say if game State T cutscene is greater than

817
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,900
5.0 for now I'm just going to wrap it round back to zero.

818
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
So that we can just basically Loop the zoom.

819
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,300
And so if we tap back to the game you can see what I'm talking about

820
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,700
here.

821
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,200
So here is US just kind of in our render is holding up remarkably well

822
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:47,600
here.

823
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,200
I can't believe that software rendering, rendering a bunch of Stack

824
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
stuff on top of each other with.

825
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,100
Absolutely no.

826
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,100
Yeah, just and and it's doing the by linear scaling and everything.

827
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,000
It's not 60 frames a second here, but then again, we're not compiling

828
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,600
and release.

829
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,900
I kind of interesting to know.

830
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,400
I'm sorry.

831
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,300
This just it always blows my mind how fast computers are these days.

832
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Let me just, I just want to know what are we in release.

833
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,600
so, if I owe to this,

834
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,400
Well, I guess we already build that part in release so we won't really

835
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,300
get any faster so never mind.

836
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
So that's like as fast as we're going to go with those things.

837
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,200
Stacked on top of each other without additional optimizations of which

838
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,400
there are many we could do.

839
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
But anyway, there you go.

840
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,400
So we're going to go ahead and sort of fuss with that.

841
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,700
So what I wanted to point out is that as you can see when we zoom in

842
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,900
now since all of our layers are at the same Z depth, we get absolutely

843
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,300
no depth.

844
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,300
This image has no depth at all right, there's no like

845
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,700
There's no feel to it, right?

846
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,700
And so as a result, you know, the the layering effect is totally

847
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,100
useless.

848
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,700
There is no point in having these layers.

849
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,100
Because as we move, they don't slide relative to each other.

850
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,200
So, what we want to do is we want to start positioning these layers.

851
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,200
Different Z depth.

852
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,000
So that that way, they'll be able to get some of that Parallax effect,

853
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,700
right?

854
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
And so, if I remember correctly, the way that we have to do that

855
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,600
because our render system is kind of a little weird.

856
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,900
I still don't love the where we ended on how we do those transforms

857
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,500
and this was because of the two and a half D thing, but two and a half

858
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,000
D things.

859
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Always.

860
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,500
That's never fabulous, right?

861
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,600
But we have that, that transform thing and the way that I believe

862
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,300
happens, is, yeah, transform offset P, right?

863
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,200
So what we need to do is every time we set that transform offset P, we

864
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,000
can sort of set where we want things to be placed, right?

865
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,000
And so if we do something like this, you could imagine placing each

866
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,800
thing further back in Z like, you know, - layer index.

867
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,300
So each layer gets a little bit further back from where it was

868
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,900
That makes sense.

869
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:01,400
In fact, I should probably do something like this times are too like

870
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,900
that.

871
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,800
And so that's just going to do that, that sort of offsetting.

872
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,600
And now what you can see, right as I do that is, you can kind of see

873
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,000
that all of the layers your scale.

874
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Now I did it the wrong way, you can see that the background layers are

875
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,600
doing faster and the reason for that is layer index one is the further

876
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,200
back farthest back layer so I actually want to move them further back

877
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
in z.

878
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,800
I want layer 1 to be the farthest back and layer 8 to be, you know,

879
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,500
the one that's

880
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Closest.

881
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,700
So, actually what I should be doing and say like let's start at

882
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,400
negative 10 or something and add with each layer index, one thing

883
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,700
forward, and so if I tap back now, now you can see that we're starting

884
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,800
to get that Parallax effect, right?

885
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,100
You can hopefully you can kind of sort of see what's happening there,

886
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,600
right?

887
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,400
So again let's let's switch to sort of our loop loop Live code editing

888
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,800
mode here.

889
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,200
So we can kind of just edit this on the fly into two little bit to get

890
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,600
it to where we want it to be.

891
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,500
So let's start thinking about

892
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,600
This problem a little bit more specifically here right now and I don't

893
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,800
know what's the best way.

894
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,100
You know, I might, what I might do here is say let's go ahead and do

895
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,100
delete Window like so and let's just give myself just a little sort of

896
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,100
bar to work with maybe up at the top here.

897
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,800
Well, or maybe down at the bottom because we don't really need to see

898
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,200
that many lines of code.

899
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's see, there we go.

900
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,500
So that's probably okay for now.

901
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,700
Oops, thank you windows, for adjusting my window, in a way that I

902
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,000
totally did not want, okay.

903
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,000
So you can see that I can kind of exaggerated this effect, quite a

904
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,500
bit.

905
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,800
If I want to buy really like exaggerating that depth right and don't

906
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,900
want that go away.

907
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,600
Oops, forgot.

908
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,500
That's got to be.

909
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,800
This would have to be more like that in order to do that.

910
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,800
So there is more

911
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,800
Duration of the death.

912
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
I really wish it would not do that.

913
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Emacs, why do you think I want to see that?

914
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,400
Why?

915
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
I don't care.

916
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,800
You know what?

917
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
We're going to put that.

918
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,100
Right over there.

919
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Okay.

920
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,600
Okay, so let's try that one more time.

921
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,700
Here we go.

922
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,300
So you can kind of see how we can kind of stratify these out even more

923
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,200
so than we are right.

924
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,000
I can keep going with that.

925
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And you can kind of see, we can get some pretty ridiculous effects in

926
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,300
terms of how we sort of stagger this.

927
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,000
And the further we go back the more sort of Parallax, a you get there.

928
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,800
Now the problem is as you go further back the things get smaller and

929
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,100
so on.

930
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,000
None of these things are mild to scale.

931
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,600
So what I hope you can tell if we want to sort of put this cutscene

932
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,200
together a little more appropriately is we're going to have to start

933
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:44,800
specifying.

934
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Each individual layer where we want it, placed how big we want it and

935
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,800
what Z we wanted at, right?

936
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,300
So that's the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to

937
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,300
break this out into something, that's a little more prescriptive about

938
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,200
how things are supposed to be placed.

939
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,100
So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to say, let's say that we've

940
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,900
got a vector3, which is layer placement, right?

941
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,300
And I might even make it a vector for, for now, which is basically

942
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:13,400
like, you know, the XYZ and then the height right, the scaling factor

943
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,000
for it.

944
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,600
So I'm going to do that and I would do that for each of our layers,

945
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,500
right?

946
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,500
So here they are.

947
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,500
Like so and we're just going to say like okay they're placed at 0 0

948
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,600
you know 0 and scaled it what were we doing the scale right now?

949
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,400
14 right this would be what we would do.

950
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,100
You know each one of these?

951
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:36,700
I don't remember.

952
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,400
We should have probably noted what each of these was like.

953
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,300
So oops.

954
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,000
So we probably should know what each of these was and I guess I could

955
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,300
do that right now if I wanted to, but we can do that in a second.

956
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:53,600
So anyway, here's the XYZ and we've got like, you know, layer 1,

957
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,500
layer, 2 layer 3, layer 4 layer, five or six layer, 7, L, 8, me that

958
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,100
one right there.

959
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,700
And so, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab that layer

960
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,200
placement.

961
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,700
Every time we go through here, I'm going to say like, okay, the

962
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,200
placement for this layer is going to be whatever it says in that table

963
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,500
like so.

964
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,300
And for each one of these, I can say, okay,

965
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,900
We're ever going to place the sky.

966
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:19,700
We're just going to place it at, you know, wherever this says to place

967
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,700
it those XYZ and the height of it's going to be whatever.

968
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,400
It says, it's height is, right?

969
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,100
That's it.

970
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,000
That's what we're going to do.

971
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,600
So, now everything's got the same placement or Parallax is going.

972
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm going to revert to just looking at a single layer.

973
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,000
So there's that single layer, right?

974
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,500
And it's not doing anything in particular, right?

975
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,600
All makes sense.

976
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,600
So, this one is kind of I don't know, for lack of a better term.

977
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,200
This is our Sky back, you know?

978
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,900
Or something like that, right?

979
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,600
And what I'm going to do with the sky background is something

980
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,400
specific.

981
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,200
I want the sky background, not to move at all because as you know, if

982
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,900
you move forward, the sky is so far away that it's not going to zoom,

983
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,900
no matter how far you walk towards the sky, any realistic amount.

984
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,300
Human motion, unless you're in a rocket ship is not going to make the

985
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,200
sky, get any bigger, it's infinitely far away for all intents and

986
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:07,700
purposes.

987
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,300
So what I want to do is for the sky background, I want to cheat.

988
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,600
I want to say that, no matter what we set, the distance of the camera

989
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,800
to, it's going to be that far away as well, right?

990
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,400
So, whatever the distance above ground is, is going to be that.

991
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,700
So now, it won't move in theory at all.

992
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,400
I hope, right?

993
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Least that's my goal.

994
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,300
Although that doesn't seem to have worked in any way.

995
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:29,800
So I take it.

996
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,800
Back that compiled, right?

997
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,100
Over right.

998
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,300
Yeah, that compiled just fine.

999
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,700
Oh whoops.

1000
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,500
Did I forget to take out by the way?

1001
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,000
No, I didn't.

1002
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,400
Did I?

1003
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,200
Yeah, it's all fine, that's all good.

1004
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,600
All right, so I want this proportional distance above ground, so we're

1005
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,100
going to the - oh well obviously duh.

1006
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,900
So what I actually need to do is I need to take this part the teen

1007
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,100
normal part, right?

1008
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,400
And I need to make sure that I just subtract that t normal part away,

1009
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,500
but that I still feel like that should have worked.

1010
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,900
I feel like if we move, I feel like that should have been 0.

1011
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,200
I put it in the wrong, put in the wrong slot.

1012
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,000
That's the size, that's the Z.

1013
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,200
Why am I so dumb?

1014
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,500
I don't know why I'm so dumb, I guess I just am.

1015
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,200
Alright, but it still doesn't work.

1016
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,100
So, I'm not that dumb.

1017
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,000
I mean, I am Dumber.

1018
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,800
Maybe that even means I'm even dumber than I thought.

1019
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,000
I was at the beginning, but point being I feel like if I move this

1020
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,500
away at the same rate that it's that the cameras moving, it should

1021
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,300
stay fixed.

1022
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,300
So I don't really know why it's not and that's kind of bothering me a

1023
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,700
little bit like I don't get it.

1024
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,500
Does that make sense?

1025
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,400
Like, why are why are we not?

1026
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,700
Being I know why?

1027
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,800
That's the zeroth entry.

1028
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Not the first.

1029
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,300
Yeah.

1030
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,200
So I should do that.

1031
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,900
Right?

1032
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:49,900
That's better.

1033
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,100
Hey look.

1034
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:51,300
It did.

1035
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,400
What I expected when I actually looked up the actual value shocking,

1036
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,000
isn't it?

1037
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,700
So I should be able to do distance above ground here.

1038
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,600
Am I do distance above ground here?

1039
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,300
That means it's going to be placed.

1040
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,100
I don't know why this is complaining.

1041
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:06,900
There we go.

1042
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,800
So if I do distance above ground here, now, I should get it.

1043
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,700
So I should be able to basically adjust this guy's settings and change

1044
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,000
where he's at, of course distance above ground means that it's where

1045
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,500
the camera.

1046
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,000
So I need to actually place it, right?

1047
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,100
This means I'm literally sitting right on the camera which is not a

1048
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:23,800
particular good thing.

1049
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,900
So I need to place it back from the camera at least a bit, right?

1050
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,600
So I'm going to place it 100 meters back.

1051
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,500
Let's say I don't know why I'm placing it there but I just am and

1052
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,900
we'll sort of play with these as we go.

1053
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And then I'm going to scale it up till 2:00.

1054
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,800
I'll that it encompasses the whole screen, right?

1055
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,300
However, big that would be.

1056
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,600
So there we go.

1057
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,900
Maybe make it a little bit bigger so it comes to full screen almost

1058
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,600
there, sit like hundred and twenty maybe so it's going to be maybe 140

1059
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,400
to Encompass the whole screen little bit more so not quite there.

1060
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,800
Okay, so now that's not moving anywhere.

1061
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,900
That one's fixed.

1062
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,800
So now we can move on

1063
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,700
The second layer and what's the second layer?

1064
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,400
That's like this weird little Skylight thing, right?

1065
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,400
This is kind of just a little light that Yankton wine in the sky that

1066
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,700
was just kind of supposed to be there.

1067
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,300
And so this shouldn't really move very much at all.

1068
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,200
So this should also be pretty far back.

1069
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,500
I would think but it should move maybe a little bit, right?

1070
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,000
Just a little bit and so if I go ahead and make this roughly the same

1071
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,300
scale as the thing like that you can see it kind of just move just a

1072
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,400
little bit.

1073
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,600
That's probably fine.

1074
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,800
So this is weird Skylight, right?

1075
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,400
So now I'm going to turn on layer 3 like so

1076
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,600
And layer 3 is way too big right now and probably needs to be moved

1077
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,200
back quite a bit as well.

1078
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,600
So I'm going to move that back quite a ways somewhere like there.

1079
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,000
You can see that looks like it's the sky is maybe moving a little bit

1080
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,700
too much.

1081
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,200
So I might actually also kind of kind of maybe dump those guys even

1082
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,700
more into the background because that does look maybe sort of right

1083
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,100
with how much the the ground when should be doing.

1084
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,100
So, I'm going to go ahead and just move these back a little bit here,

1085
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:04,900
as well.

1086
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,400
And then,

1087
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,700
Them, right?

1088
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,400
So I'm going to go ahead and make that bigger like so it's not the

1089
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,100
right size, I don't actually know.

1090
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:13,700
Oops.

1091
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah.

1092
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,600
So that is about the right size.

1093
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,500
300, 300.

1094
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,100
There we go.

1095
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,800
And so now that's moving because I want there to be a pretty big

1096
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,500
difference between those two in terms of movement and that's good.

1097
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,500
The the that row of trees is obviously you know, a little bit small.

1098
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,400
So I'm going to go ahead and just make that a little larger there.

1099
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,200
It is, that looks pretty good, but it's probably placed a little bit.

1100
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,100
Oddly it should probably be sort of.

1101
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,400
Out of should probably be maybe a little lower higher.

1102
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm not entirely certain so, you know, I guess what I'm saying is it

1103
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,400
probably should be moved like up or something like that.

1104
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,900
I'm not super certain so we'll see as I go forwards, where how we want

1105
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,800
to place that in terms of X and Y?

1106
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,600
All right, so here is adding another layer on top there.

1107
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,300
This one again, obviously needs to be moved back quite a bit, so I'm

1108
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,500
going to move it back into sort of, that, that background.

1109
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,800
And this is, this is, I guess I

1110
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Name these as well.

1111
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,700
This is the first row of trees or that the back mostro.

1112
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,100
This is like hills and trees, right?

1113
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,500
So, and okay, so I moved it back.

1114
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,500
They're going to have to scale it up a bit again.

1115
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,500
So here we go.

1116
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,400
That's still probably not the size.

1117
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,100
It should be and it looks like that wouldn't have very much Parallax.

1118
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,800
I might drop that guy back a bit, just a little bit there so that

1119
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,700
there's a little bit more between them.

1120
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,800
You can kind of see that start that Parallax starting to kick in there

1121
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,200
so it's pretty nice.

1122
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,300
Just go ahead and start to pull these together a little bit more.

1123
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,000
It's get that, get that up a bit.

1124
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,300
So you can kind of see how the Parallax is starting to come together

1125
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,000
there again.

1126
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,400
This guy looks a little bit too low so maybe we're going to have to

1127
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,700
move him up a little bit.

1128
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,000
As well, sort of fill in those cracks.

1129
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,500
Why did that not move up a bit?

1130
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,900
Should have just me or did that?

1131
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,800
Not move up at all?

1132
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,300
What's going on?

1133
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,200
What's going on here?

1134
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,400
It's compiling but it's not moving up.

1135
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,200
Oh, because I'm editing the wrong one.

1136
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,500
Nice.

1137
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,500
Fantastic.

1138
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,500
Not the brightest bulb on the tree sometimes guys, not the brightest

1139
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,300
bulb on the tree.

1140
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,400
All right, so moving that up.

1141
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,100
Let's see here.

1142
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
Going up to 10.

1143
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,400
And maybe move this guy back down, I don't know.

1144
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,000
It's that look more right to you will see again getting that vertical

1145
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,400
position, right?

1146
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,700
It's probably going to take a while.

1147
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,100
We're probably gonna have to get a little bit higher up in the layers.

1148
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,400
Thank you for the five minute warning.

1149
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,700
They're all right.

1150
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,700
So this guy again, probably going to have to be, you know, more like

1151
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,700
this or so, right.

1152
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,000
Like something more like that.

1153
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,100
I don't actually know how Parallax, see.

1154
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,400
We want it to be so it's a little bit hard to guess sometimes, but

1155
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,200
there we go.

1156
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,600
So you can really start to see that that parallax,

1157
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,100
Fact coming into play, right?

1158
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,800
You can sort of I hope you hopefully you guys can kind of see how that

1159
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,500
that's feeling now, you know, as a kind of does that sort of slow that

1160
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,800
sort of slow pan and

1161
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,200
all right.

1162
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,500
So yeah, that's looking pretty good so far.

1163
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,300
I kind of want to see just what that looks like in general.

1164
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,400
You can kind of see The Parallax working relatively well.

1165
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,000
So let's go ahead and add those last ones in here.

1166
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,100
This is Hills and trees too.

1167
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,000
Front Hills and trees.

1168
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,700
So let's get layer 6 in there.

1169
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,600
That's like on the side.

1170
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,900
I also don't know.

1171
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,800
Is this guy a little too scaled right now?

1172
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:08,700
Not actually sure.

1173
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,900
Yeah, it looks like he is a little bit to scaled, it's probably should

1174
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,600
be more like that.

1175
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,600
I don't know if this guy should be more like this as well.

1176
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,000
Possibly hard to say.

1177
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,900
Nope, you can still see the edges of that guy.

1178
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,500
So that probably should be more like that.

1179
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,200
Yeah, so.

1180
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,900
Alright, let's move this down a bit.

1181
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,700
So that's probably about right scale-wise.

1182
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,800
Yep.

1183
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,200
And then this guy, I don't know where this guy is.

1184
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:37,500
Let's say he's at - 30 maybe.

1185
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,800
Oops, not negative 3.

1186
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,600
You're 30.

1187
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,200
I said,

1188
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:49,000
And then he should also be quite large, and he's also kind of off to

1189
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,200
the side to the right side.

1190
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,800
You can see he's kind of a right side only sort of piece.

1191
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,000
I don't know how big he supposed to be completely honest with you, I'm

1192
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,800
not really sure how it's intended.

1193
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,000
But this is like right side tree.

1194
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,600
And fence.

1195
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,300
So I'm going to move him over like a hundred units or not.

1196
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Let's try 10 units.

1197
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,700
Let's try 30.

1198
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,100
That looks more right to me.

1199
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,700
I feel like you should be moving quite a bit faster based on where he

1200
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,000
is, wonder if maybe that would be a little bit better.

1201
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,200
Possibly.

1202
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,100
Again, it's really hard to say, sometimes with some of these things.

1203
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,100
It's really very like, you know, kind of tuned to your preference, all

1204
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:45,700
right?

1205
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,100
And so, let's just kind of finish up.

1206
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,000
We got number seven, which is our orphanage, right?

1207
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,900
And we'll put that back - 20 and then we'll just scale it up to

1208
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,800
roughly how we think it should be, Maybe dirty.

1209
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,800
So 35.

1210
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's a little too small at the start, so I guess it's got to be more

1211
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,700
like 40.

1212
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,400
Right.

1213
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,100
Looking pretty good.

1214
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,400
And now we're just need one more layer and then we're done.

1215
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,500
So there is our form, you know, our front most layer and we got a

1216
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
scale that one up to its normal size, whatever.

1217
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,200
That's going to be probably about 30.

1218
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,100
although that one looks like it's really close, so that might be more

1219
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,700
like negative five, like so,

1220
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,000
So it looks like we need to move our orphanage down a little bit.

1221
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,700
I would say just a bit from where it is.

1222
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,400
So I'm going to go ahead and just drop that guy by 10 units or so

1223
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,500
oops, that's too much.

1224
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,800
That looks that looks about good to me.

1225
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,200
Right, looking pretty good there.

1226
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,300
And so now we just got to finish up this guy which needs to move over

1227
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,000
a little bit.

1228
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,500
I think maybe one unit

1229
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,600
Maybe two.

1230
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,400
And probably down a little bit.

1231
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,500
so, maybe

1232
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,700
Maybe something like - 2 units, down.

1233
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,700
Here, maybe needs to be just a little bit bigger.

1234
00:56:59,500 --> 00:56:59,800
All right.

1235
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:03,900
Okay.

1236
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,200
And so now the only problem that we have left and I'll go to the Q&A

1237
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
in just a second here.

1238
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,700
The only problem that we have left now is as you can kind of.

1239
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,900
See, weird zooming towards nothing now, you know, as game developers

1240
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,700
as programmers.

1241
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,300
Maybe you're not supposed to be experts in cinematography and that's

1242
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:18,500
fine.

1243
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,100
But hopefully you would at least noticed something a little bit

1244
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,900
peculiar here.

1245
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,600
Which is to say that we probably should be zooming towards the action

1246
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,500
which is going to be the orphanage, not the distance and you can work

1247
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,600
on Azumi into nothing here.

1248
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,400
So what I'd like to do in addition just really quickly is go up here

1249
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,200
and add some code.

1250
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:39,200
So that instead of just distance above ground here when we actually do

1251
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,300
the camera stuff we can sort of offset these guys as well and so there

1252
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,900
can be sort of a little like vector3 sort of like a V3 like you know

1253
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,600
camera offset things something like this and

1254
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Yeah, and so when we do that camera off set, we can sort of do an X Y

1255
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,600
as well.

1256
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:05,300
So RT normal can go like v-- camera, start the camera and you know,

1257
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,200
sort of thing.

1258
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,000
And then our camera offset can be, you know, camera start.

1259
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,400
I don't know if we do linear blend, I think we do where we do camera,

1260
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,900
start, whatever that t normal is and camera and like this, hopefully

1261
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,700
that'll work.

1262
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,200
We don't have linear blend yet.

1263
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,400
Yes, we do linear

1264
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,300
Blend blend linear.

1265
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
How do we tie know?

1266
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
We have come on, folks?

1267
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,700
I know we've written this before.

1268
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,700
There's no way.

1269
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,700
There's just no way, seriously.

1270
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,300
Lerp, that's what we called it.

1271
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,600
I don't love that term.

1272
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,400
I don't know why I use that, but I guess I must have had a reason.

1273
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,100
All right, so if we have camera off site here, what I can do is just

1274
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,500
say, okay, whatever the placement x x y z is, we could just subtract

1275
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,000
the camera placement from that and that effectively offsets everything

1276
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,100
by wherever the camera actually is right.

1277
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,500
It's basically just moving the camera, is moving everything by the

1278
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,400
same as what the camera is going to move by, right?

1279
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,200
So if I want to do that, I can set the camera start to be 0, 0, 0,

1280
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,600
which is the sort of the star technique starting alignment of

1281
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,100
everything.

1282
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,600
But then when we move the camera for words, I can move.

1283
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,200
Kind of down and and and to the left or something like that.

1284
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,000
So I can, I can do something like moving it one unit in each

1285
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,800
direction, right, like that.

1286
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,900
And so now in theory when we do that, I should be able to do something

1287
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,500
where the camera kind of, we could essentially pick the focus Point by

1288
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,800
moving the camera as we go.

1289
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,000
So I move this up to the top here so you can kind of see now we're

1290
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,500
starting to focus a little bit more on the action, which is what we

1291
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,600
want to do, right?

1292
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,000
We want to kind of focus on the important parts of the image.

1293
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,600
So I'm just going to tune that.

1294
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,200
To the part where it's relatively.

1295
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,300
It's relatively plausible that that might be what we're trying to look

1296
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,700
at.

1297
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,300
I happen to know because I've seen the rest of the cutscene art,

1298
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,600
obviously that we're trying to zoom in sort of towards those windows

1299
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,700
over there on the side.

1300
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,500
And so we're looking at something a little bit more like this.

1301
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,400
And so if you take a look at this scene, now, I'm pretty, I'm pretty

1302
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,200
delighted with that.

1303
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,000
That looks, that looks pretty darn cool, right?

1304
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,400
And, and so, you know, we probably want to in this little bit more,

1305
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,300
but for 41 days worth of putting cutscene stuff together, that's,

1306
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,100
that's pretty nice.

1307
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:28,300
It's looking pretty good.

1308
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,800
And, and I think

1309
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,500
We're pretty happy with that, right?

1310
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,900
So yeah, so that's where we're at and and we'll tweak it a little bit

1311
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,400
tomorrow.

1312
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,500
So let's go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1313
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,100
And I don't have text read anymore, I had to format the laptop for

1314
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,600
handmade Condit was using that.

1315
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,700
So let's go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1316
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,700
I don't know if I can do this here from this one.

1317
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,600
Yeah, there we go.

1318
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,100
Let's see.

1319
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,500
All right, folks, if you have any questions about the programming

1320
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:18,100
here, please feel free to give it to me with a Q: so to speak.

1321
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,600
Let's see.

1322
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,100
Elephant, would you normally want to get the position scale for each

1323
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,000
layer from the artist?

1324
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,400
If so, how would you go about doing that?

1325
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,800
That depends on whether or not?

1326
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,000
The artist is familiar with any particular tool that allows them to

1327
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,400
set up a scene like this.

1328
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,500
A lot of artists if they're just straight, illustrators aren't they

1329
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:53,000
don't know how to use like say after effects or stuff like that.

1330
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,100
And so they just knew how to make stuff in Photoshop, right?

1331
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,500
And so if you're working with artists like that, then the answer is

1332
01:01:59,500 --> 01:01:59,900
no.

1333
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,000
There isn't any

1334
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,800
A way to do it because they don't know how to set up a preview this.

1335
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,700
And so you just kind of have to work with them and you where you set

1336
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,200
it up and you could give them a, you could, maybe make a little thing

1337
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,100
that they could use to tweak those values, right?

1338
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,200
Like put up a little UI so they could build it in the tool and not if

1339
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,300
you are familiar with working.

1340
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,000
If your artist is familiar with with that like they normally work in

1341
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,400
you know flash or something like that that allows them to set up

1342
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,100
something like that.

1343
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:24,900
Would be a move like this.

1344
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,100
Then.

1345
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,300
Yeah, the way you would do that is whatever that tool is.

1346
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,900
You would have to write an importer for some

1347
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,700
Data for that, right?

1348
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,300
And that's going to be entirely dependent on what tool they use.

1349
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,400
Because there's really not much of a way in Photoshop to do it.

1350
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,800
If you really want to do it in Photoshop, you could have them set up

1351
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:48,700
to layer comps 1, at the start of the zoom, in one of the end.

1352
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,800
But that's really going to be hard for the artist because the artist

1353
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,100
in Photoshop won't have the zine positioning.

1354
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,800
Well, Photoshop does have some 3D utilities so maybe you could do

1355
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,300
something there.

1356
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,800
I've never played.

1357
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Those so I don't know and it's not really meant to be an animation

1358
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
package even though it does have some of that in it.

1359
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,800
So you probably could if they happen to know in Photoshop I do it.

1360
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,800
But a lot of ours aren't I going to be familiar with those tools

1361
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,300
either?

1362
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,300
Stricken down.

1363
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,000
I'm new to programming and no intermediate Java.

1364
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,200
Only.

1365
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,700
Can you explain what you use emacs for if you're using visual studio?

1366
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,700
Yes, Visual Studio.

1367
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,000
We are only really using its debugger feature.

1368
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,200
That's all we're using.

1369
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:32,700
So we actually build and edit code outside of visual studio.

1370
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:38,500
So we use emacs to edit the code and we use a command line build.

1371
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,400
So we don't ever use Visual Studio really for anything, other than

1372
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
just the debugging process, if that makes sense.

1373
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,400
I think you should move the sky light up a tad.

1374
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:51,900
Bit.

1375
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,800
Well, you know, if you think the Skylight should be moved up a bit,

1376
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,600
that's something you should do on your build of handmade hero which

1377
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,000
you can tweak to your heart's content.

1378
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,500
I'm not really done tweaking this because I want to move the fence up

1379
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,000
and do a couple other things as well but it's basically, you know,

1380
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,800
it's mostly there.

1381
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,500
Orlando Bloom.

1382
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,400
I feel like we should have some deep voice narration.

1383
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,100
Yes, that is coming, but that's kind of, you know, that's that's after

1384
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,000
we get our cutscene shops in place and then we can worry about syncing

1385
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,900
it to voice acting.

1386
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,800
Did you ever have trouble while learning to program?

1387
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,500
I'm currently getting my rump handed to me in Java class.

1388
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:45,100
Well, yeah, I mean, I never took a perm in class actually in my life

1389
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,600
because I learned to program when I was seven.

1390
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:53,100
So I never got my rump handed to me per se, but as a child learning to

1391
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:53,500
program.

1392
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,300
Yes, if there is plenty of times, I just didn't know how to do stuff

1393
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,100
and my dad was a programmer, and I'd have to call him in, and be like

1394
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,400
that, can you help me debug this thing?

1395
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,600
Because I'm too stupid.

1396
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,400
And so, yeah, absolutely.

1397
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,000
I can't relate to having trouble in a programming class because I

1398
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,700
never had one, but I can certainly relate to struggling with things

1399
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,200
because it does take a long time to become a good programmer and it,

1400
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,300
there's a lot of things along the way that are stumbling blocks and

1401
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,000
takes time, takes a lot of practice, a lot of practice.

1402
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,800
Will we ever load PNG files.

1403
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,900
If so, will we be writing our own loader or using SVG image?

1404
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,300
I read that.

1405
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,600
It's tricky to load png's or no.

1406
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,300
No, we will never be loading png's.

1407
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,900
We load our HHA files.

1408
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,100
And so we we strictly load.

1409
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,000
Ha files.

1410
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,900
That is all we load.

1411
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,300
Will your cutscenes be coded like this or be separate as data in a

1412
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,000
separate file?

1413
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,900
They will be coded like this because

1414
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,500
Since we don't have any, there's no external tool for editing them

1415
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,200
that we have.

1416
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,900
There's no benefit to having them be an external files since our game

1417
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,800
is currently our only preview tool

1418
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,600
Let's see.

1419
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,800
Do you need to know in depth linear algebra to do this?

1420
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:30,400
No, well, I mean, yeah, you're not in depth, right?

1421
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,100
You don't even know how to solve a matrix to do this, but you do need

1422
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,600
to know at least Vector, you know, basic Vector stuff.

1423
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,200
K.

1424
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,500
You mentioned your code base is mostly independent for the most part.

1425
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,100
Does that include random number generation or do you use the C library

1426
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,400
for that yet?

1427
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,600
My code base does not link to the C library, full stop.

1428
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,100
My code base at work actually, doesn't link to any Library besides

1429
01:06:59,100 --> 01:06:59,900
kernel32.

1430
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:00,900
So you only one

1431
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,000
How do you handle 3D audio and your other engines and game's opening

1432
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,300
allergy?

1433
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,400
Implement something yourself.

1434
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,000
I've never done 3D audio.

1435
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,900
It's not my kind of thing.

1436
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,200
I like,

1437
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,800
I don't tend to really be interested that much in making 3D games

1438
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,900
myself.

1439
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,900
So I just never have to do that sort of thing.

1440
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,300
I tend to like games where the audio is more authored and not it's not

1441
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,400
about like placing you being in an environment or anything.

1442
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,100
So I don't know if I ever make a VR game.

1443
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,600
I'd probably worried about 3D audio but that's just not the kind of

1444
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,100
game that I tend to be interested in.

1445
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,500
Oh, the Scala has a gap at the top.

1446
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,400
Is what you're saying?

1447
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,500
We can kind of size that up a bit.

1448
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:09,700
If you're worried about the gap for, I guess, like, yeah, we can, we

1449
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,200
can move it up or we could size it up.

1450
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,500
I'm not sure which would be better.

1451
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,700
Maybe move it a touch closer.

1452
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:20,200
Might also be kind of nice, maybe like,

1453
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,100
That so it has a little more motion to it.

1454
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,899
Have you talked further with Pat Wyatt about coming on the stream?

1455
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:39,399
Or is that postponed for when Network becomes relevant?

1456
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,100
I thought his talk was very touching in particular.

1457
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:42,399
Yeah.

1458
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:48,000
I mean, we're definitely going to do something with that, so we will

1459
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
definitely be finding a way for Pat to do some streaming.

1460
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,300
I don't know how we're going to do it just yet and it might not

1461
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:58,100
necessarily be in the context of handmade hero because I don't know

1462
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,800
that am a hero is really a networking, kind of a

1463
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,500
Thing but you know will we will figure something out.

1464
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:07,399
I just don't know what that will be, if that makes sense.

1465
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,200
Captain craft.

1466
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,399
Is this code going to be for a cinematic in the game or you just

1467
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,200
testing functionality?

1468
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,600
Now I know it's a cinematic in the game.

1469
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,899
This is like the first shot of the Cinematic in the game of the of the

1470
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,200
of the opening cutscene.

1471
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,000
Should I use you and 32 T?

1472
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,200
Over you 32?

1473
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,500
You can use whatever you want.

1474
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:33,300
I prefer you 32 these days, but if you want to use your in 32, T,

1475
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,600
that's totally cool.

1476
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:42,100
What do you think about adding lighting effects to the cutscene, like

1477
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,600
a flickering?

1478
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,800
Repulsing of the candlelight in the welcome sign.

1479
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,899
Well, that's totally fine.

1480
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:51,000
If you want to do it, that's not possible with the way that yangshin

1481
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,800
authored, these art pieces, if that makes sense.

1482
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,100
So there's no, the lights aren't painted separately, so they can't be

1483
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,300
modulated separately.

1484
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,100
That makes sense.

1485
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,100
I mean, you could do a Cheesy thing where you just kind of like, you

1486
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,900
know, masked out some things and kind of just flickered than that way.

1487
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,700
But it wouldn't probably be particularly compelling if that makes

1488
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,100
sense.

1489
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:18,700
K.

1490
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,300
I meant the image format before we pack them in the asset.

1491
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:21,700
I understand.

1492
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:23,100
We're currently using BMP.

1493
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,400
So like I said, many times asset pre-processing is not cut part of the

1494
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,700
stream so that's just it wasn't as the only point of that asset

1495
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,100
processor that we've got in there.

1496
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:38,800
Now was just to define the file format so that I could you do stuff,

1497
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,900
like what I did where I uploaded assets that are packed in the file

1498
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,200
format, so we will never touch that again.

1499
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,400
That's like, as far as we're concerned, we have H A files.

1500
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,800
They follow our file format, we load from them and that's it.

1501
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,900
Insofar, as for adding more cutscenes or modding?

1502
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,400
Wouldn't it make more sense to keep the Parallax constants?

1503
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,500
Some where in the HHA file?

1504
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,100
I mean it depends, it depends on what you want, right?

1505
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,000
I would say no.

1506
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,000
And the reason I'd say no is because if you want to support full

1507
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,500
modding, we should we would probably add support for dll loading,

1508
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,100
right?

1509
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,700
In which case you can just add a new cutscenes by providing the code

1510
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:27,000
that renders the cutscene

1511
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:27,700
Right.

1512
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,600
So I'd probably rather go that route so that the cutscenes could have

1513
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,600
like Dynamic dynamism in them as well or be launched at any time and

1514
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,300
stuff like that rather than trying to make up our own out format for

1515
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:39,700
it.

1516
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:45,300
Because in general, my opinion, art formats art form at stuff or like

1517
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,700
data stuff, should only be for stuff.

1518
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,700
We actually have an editor, like, an external editor for, you know

1519
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,200
what I mean?

1520
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,800
Because we don't have an external editor, then there's no point in it.

1521
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,900
We could have just done a big code, right?

1522
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,800
Super Caleb don't need to.

1523
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,700
To use the 32 GB or 32 an opengl 32 for a few things.

1524
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,100
You don't have to link to them know.

1525
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,200
You can just dynamically load from them.

1526
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,700
The only thing you have to link to is kernel32 and technically you

1527
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,500
don't have to link to it so much as it's going to, you need to get its

1528
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,000
its Base address to start with because without get proc address which

1529
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,200
is in kernel32, you can't dynamically load anything, right?

1530
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,200
So you need kernel32 but they're obviously their tricks.

1531
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,900
You could do to not actually linked with it but there's not a whole

1532
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:28,900
lot of point to that.

1533
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,200
K, if you're running up in jail stuff, do you use glue or write your

1534
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,900
own extension loader?

1535
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,200
And load the function by yourself.

1536
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,800
I have my own extension loader and I load the function pointers myself

1537
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,100
long Boolean.

1538
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:45,600
You could make a to DVR game, just room with a giant video wall.

1539
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,300
I guess was like good and maybe someday I would

1540
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,400
I have had thoughts like that before I believe me off topic.

1541
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,500
Thank you for handmade kind of wash it twice already.

1542
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,600
You're very welcome.

1543
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,100
I'm very glad you liked it.

1544
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,900
Purposely drifting not a question.

1545
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,000
Just want to thank you for doing Hamid Khan and glad to see you back

1546
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
during handmade hero.

1547
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Thank you as well.

1548
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,400
And in fact, several people think of your hammock on thank you all for

1549
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,800
coming and or watching it was really kind of amazing how much of turn

1550
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,700
out there was it was pretty great had, I had a great time at the event

1551
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,900
to and I like meeting everyone and seeing people at the like makeshift

1552
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:29,200
Gatherings the like a dock Gatherings that that we had afterwards, for

1553
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:29,900
pretty great.

1554
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,700
So yeah.

1555
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,700
Let's see.

1556
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,800
Any plans for crude lighting and Shadow support for things like light

1557
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,600
posts, light light posts.

1558
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah, I don't know what light posts mean, we are planning on doing

1559
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,200
lighting for in-game lighting.

1560
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,400
That's, that's like the one major to do left on our renderer actually.

1561
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,400
Gragas, will you show all content creation on stream to watching you

1562
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:18,800
spend hours?

1563
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,500
Doing cutscenes?

1564
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,300
Might not be fun.

1565
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,100
Yes.

1566
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:22,400
Oh

1567
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:30,300
Not to sound overly harsh but this is not supposed to be fun.

1568
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:38,000
Making games is about doing work and I have absolutely no interest in

1569
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,800
making the stream.

1570
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,200
Quote-unquote fun.

1571
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:45,700
It's strictly supposed to be educational and so part of it is we will

1572
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,500
absolutely do 100% of the code that ships in the game on the Stream.

1573
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,300
And since the cut Cinco chips in the game, we will be doing it on

1574
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,800
stream and you are welcome to skip those episodes if you don't want.

1575
01:14:59,500 --> 01:14:59,800
But yeah.

1576
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,800
I would say if watching me do it is not fun.

1577
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,200
Then since I do it pretty quick compared to people who probably a g

1578
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:15,000
before you're probably not going to be very good in terms of a

1579
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
perspective career if that makes sense.

1580
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,300
Set it for Q colons.

1581
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,600
Out of interest.

1582
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,800
If you wanted to implement a zoom that curved to the Contours of the

1583
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,100
Hill forward drop forward, would you still look to implement that in

1584
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,600
code or look at a visual tool for something like that?

1585
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:34,500
Well, you know visual tools are usually for when you know that the

1586
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,900
amount of time it takes you to do the work to support the visual tool

1587
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,300
or create.

1588
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,700
The visual tool is going to be less than the amount of work.

1589
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,700
It'll take you make the cut scenes.

1590
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,100
We only have like 12, cutscenes in handmade hero and they're all

1591
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:49,700
basically like bisque like less.

1592
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:52,800
In fact, this is probably one of the more complicated shots so it

1593
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,000
probably only take us a couple days to make all the cutscenes.

1594
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,500
So there's

1595
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,900
Point in doing anything more complicated.

1596
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,900
If you found that you started doing one, like what you were talking

1597
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,800
about and it was too complicated for you to do without a visual tool

1598
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,300
and you're spending like days on it, it's not coming together.

1599
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:14,900
Then maybe you would want to think about hey is the right trade-off to

1600
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,000
do something to support like flash or something.

1601
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,100
So we can make it in there or whatever you want you know, Maya who

1602
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:26,600
knows whatever you want to use or to make a little visual tool myself

1603
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,100
to do it.

1604
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,400
You know that's that's just a

1605
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,100
Judgment call.

1606
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,300
You have to make based on how long you think you see, things taking

1607
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,700
and how much work you think it would be to make either an importer or

1608
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,100
a tool that would allow you to do that because if it takes you a week

1609
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,700
to write the Importer, then if you'd only would have taken you a week

1610
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,200
to do the cutscenes, you haven't gained anything, right?

1611
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,300
So, that's just you just, you got to figure that out, right?

1612
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,000
Pinkie Pie, thanks for the stream.

1613
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,800
K CI, you are welcome, the geek pirate.

1614
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,000
Did you have to study algorithms in depth?

1615
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,600
Or did you learn from on hand experience?

1616
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,600
I'm not sure what that means.

1617
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:18,500
I did study algorithms but it was usually, while I'm programming.

1618
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,000
I mean, I did have an algorithm.

1619
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,300
I've read algorithms books before and I read through algorithms, I

1620
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,700
don't and I'm not necessarily using right at the moment, but I also do

1621
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:30,300
a lot of practice with things and, you know, like, I'm

1622
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,600
So weaker in areas of things, I don't use, for example sorting I

1623
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,700
hardly ever use.

1624
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,200
So I'm not that good at writing sorts for example.

1625
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,300
I just because I almost never write them.

1626
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:44,600
so, it's like, just

1627
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,600
Even though I kind of know what they are.

1628
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,200
They're less second nature to me than something like linked lists or

1629
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:50,500
arrays.

1630
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:55,900
Hash tables that I use all the time you know we're or any of the 3D

1631
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:00,100
Mass stuff even like texture sampling and stuff like that is just if I

1632
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,400
write so often that those are much more second nature to me than some

1633
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,600
of the some of the classic data structures and algorithms like

1634
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,600
You know, sorted trees or sorting I just I just don't write them that

1635
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,000
often.

1636
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,900
Crockett is vsync part of the render at least on my end of the stream

1637
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,400
there is quite a bit of tearing not sure if the stream or not.

1638
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:30,200
So no, we don't vsync right now.

1639
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,800
And the reason for that is because on the on Windows platform, what

1640
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,100
we're doing right now is we literally just blit our bitmap to the

1641
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:37,600
screen.

1642
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:41,900
We don't go through the 3D Hardware path, yet the 3D Hardware path

1643
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,000
will do the vsync automatically for us.

1644
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,900
And so when we switch, if that makes sense.

1645
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,200
If we switch to

1646
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:53,900
Going to the 3D pipeline, which we will somewhere down the road, then

1647
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,700
we'll just have the vsync but our current renderer doesn't do any

1648
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,200
attempts to be sink at all.

1649
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,800
It literally just copies the buffer to the screen at that time.

1650
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:11,200
That said on the vsync you are seeing is on your end.

1651
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,700
And the reason that I know that is because since we're going through

1652
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,000
stretch bullet that's actually going through Windows Aero which is

1653
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,400
actually compositing.

1654
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,100
On the vsync.

1655
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,400
And so for example on my screen there is no tearing.

1656
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,800
So I believe the tearing that you're seeing is actually on your end

1657
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:32,700
but we are also not actually doing anything to try and guarantee vsync

1658
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,600
on our end I believe but I could be wrong about that.

1659
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,600
I don't know.

1660
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,300
I'm trying to think if Arrow always does that or not.

1661
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,900
But like just looking at it on mine, there is no vsync tearing.

1662
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,600
There's no there's no tearing on my screen.

1663
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,000
for example, so if you're seeing it, you're probably seeing tearing on

1664
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,400
your video playback,

1665
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,500
Captain craft.

1666
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,700
Have any of the sponsors to your question that hammock on affected

1667
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,300
your approach to certain problems?

1668
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,100
I don't know because I haven't really been working on anything that

1669
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,500
was related to

1670
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:16,800
stuff.

1671
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,300
I asked, I was pretty interested in Tommy's approach to like doing

1672
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,200
everything by index in the art system.

1673
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,500
I don't know that that will change my approach to anything, but it

1674
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,700
definitely surprised me.

1675
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:31,200
It was not something I would have expected and it was interesting and

1676
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,400
it was like he had a very sort of rationale for it to it was like

1677
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,800
fairly well thought through and so I just

1678
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,400
I found that interesting and that would probably be something that I

1679
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,100
would remember.

1680
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,200
So I don't know that it will necessary change any of my approaches,

1681
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:45,700
but

1682
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,700
Was the Snowman intention of looking down to indicate a feeling of

1683
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,100
sadness, or am I reading too much into it?

1684
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:57,100
You would have to ask Yang shinai because I do a lot of work art

1685
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:59,600
directing at Molly on our main game.

1686
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,000
I try not to really art direct handmade hero, very much, so yangshin,

1687
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,200
really just kind of decides on her own.

1688
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,700
What things are going to look like?

1689
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,000
And I only basically, like for this, I kind of just sketched out like,

1690
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,800
here's what the shots are and and so on, and then she like does all of

1691
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,100
the detail and unless there's something very specific

1692
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,700
You know, I say like I need these sort of layers in it and I need it.

1693
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,100
It's going to kind of pan this way and it's going to have these

1694
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,600
elements, you know, but then I don't do stuff like actually do the art

1695
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,300
direction of like it should be, you know, this way or that way or like

1696
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,600
the Snowman needs to be sad.

1697
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,700
Or I don't, I don't do that on this project because I feel like it's

1698
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,100
would be just too much work.

1699
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:44,000
And so, I try to let Yang should just do what she wants to do.

1700
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,700
If there's something that I feel like really needs to be changed for

1701
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,100
some reason I'll bring it up but otherwise

1702
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,900
So I don't micromanage that at all.

1703
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:11,900
Chism has a programming problem ever stumped, you even after Googling

1704
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,200
and or collaboration.

1705
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,700
So I'm not sure.

1706
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,400
I understand the question because programming isn't

1707
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,000
like, I don't know that I've ever been stumped by a problem because

1708
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,800
that suggests that there's a like a like a solution to a program

1709
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,300
problem, but there's no such thing as a solution to programming

1710
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,600
problems, right?

1711
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:35,000
There's only metrics how fast it was, how memory efficient it was, how

1712
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,300
robust it was, how little code you could do it in, how well it

1713
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,500
integrated with something else.

1714
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,700
And pretty much almost all the time.

1715
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,600
I always either know or feel like I could do better than what I did if

1716
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,100
I wanted to

1717
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,600
War time, studying the problem.

1718
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,200
So I don't think I've ever been stumped by a parking problem, but I

1719
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,900
every code I write is something that I could see doing.

1720
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Better job on by devoting myself more fully to solving it as a

1721
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,700
problem, right?

1722
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,100
So,

1723
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,800
So yeah, I guess you guys are saying to add that as a quote, but I

1724
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,000
guess.

1725
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,200
Yeah.

1726
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,900
I mean that just kind of seems obvious to me.

1727
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,600
I mean, I guess it.

1728
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,800
I don't feel like it really needs to be said like

1729
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,200
In computer science, there are solutions to specific problems of the

1730
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:10,600
form.

1731
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,800
Like, you know what is the the worst-case running time of a particular

1732
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,900
algorithm, right?

1733
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,400
Like you can answer questions like that and there is like a specific

1734
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:23,500
solution in the sense that there is only one.

1735
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:23,800
Right?

1736
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,800
Mathematical answer to that question.

1737
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:30,000
But in terms of actual black writing, actual code that does stuff,

1738
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:34,200
there is no solution to its there isn't even a problem.

1739
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:35,400
There's just

1740
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:38,400
Here is what the code needs to do.

1741
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,600
It's assumed that if you know how to program, you will get it to do

1742
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:43,100
that.

1743
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,200
So then the only question is, what are all of the metrics that you

1744
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:52,300
might measure how good that that particular solution is in the sense,

1745
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:52,800
right?

1746
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:58,000
So calling it a solution is almost wrong and I feel like, you know,

1747
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,400
it's just our nominee nature that we say oh that solved.

1748
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:00,800
The problem.

1749
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,200
Are we worse?

1750
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:01,500
Losing?

1751
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,900
What we really mean to say is we implemented it, it's an

1752
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,900
implementation.

1753
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,400
It's not a

1754
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,600
Ellucian, it's an implementation, any implementation solves the

1755
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,500
problem or it's not actually an implementation, but each

1756
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,100
implementation has different characteristics.

1757
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,000
We might measure.

1758
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,000
And by measuring those characteristics, we can compare the

1759
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,700
implementations and decide, which one of them is the most appropriate

1760
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,000
or best given our criteria.

1761
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:23,500
Some implementations may be strictly better than others.

1762
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,100
Other implementations might be better than others in some ways and

1763
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,500
worse than others and some other ways, right?

1764
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:33,300
And then particular pending on what you wanted to do, you may pick one

1765
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,500
or the other as being a better.

1766
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:36,300
Implementation.

1767
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,700
When you are an intermediate programmer, how often is it?

1768
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:46,800
That you use Google to help you look up solutions to hard problems?

1769
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,500
It's a funny question, it's amusing.

1770
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,800
When I was an intermediate programmer, Google had not been founded

1771
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,200
yet.

1772
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,800
Colonel Dragon, it may be

1773
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:00,300
Obvious.

1774
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,300
But there is an entire class of programmers that seem to think

1775
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:07,200
otherwise, well that's unfortunate, but

1776
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:09,800
What do you do?

1777
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,500
Did you notice the Triforce in the windows?

1778
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,500
Oh no, I didn't.

1779
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,700
Like I said, yangsan kind of decides how that stuff goes.

1780
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,400
I did not notice.

1781
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,600
There's a Triforce in the windows I guess it's not quite a tri Force

1782
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,000
because the top one is not divided.

1783
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:33,500
In fact, neither is the middle one but the two side ones I guess our

1784
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:34,300
Triforce.

1785
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,800
It's not a it's not like a fully recursive Triforce but yeah, I didn't

1786
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,400
notice that.

1787
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,700
Students are three one of my mentors used to say that there should be

1788
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,900
a book called algorithms data structures and trade-offs.

1789
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:50,700
That is a very good thing to say.

1790
01:27:50,700 --> 01:27:52,400
Yes, I would totally agree with that.

1791
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:04,100
All right, I think we're done with the Q colons.

1792
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:16,900
So I'm going to wrap things up, close down the game like so.

1793
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:23,800
Okay, save the drawing, save the drawing, save the world.

1794
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,700
And there we go.

1795
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,200
Thank you everyone for joining me for another episode handmade here.

1796
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,300
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1797
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:39,300
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, and well, you'd

1798
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,300
have some downloading to do.

1799
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,200
But if you have to would like to follow along at home, you can always

1800
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,300
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org.

1801
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,800
And then you can go download the source code and the art pack, which

1802
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,500
you will need if you want to follow along with all of our cutscene

1803
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,500
work, they're going to do this week.

1804
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,900
If you would like to do that, go to handmade out or here at, or

1805
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,800
pre-order the game and it comes with all the source code and the

1806
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:00,800
artists we use it.

1807
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:03,200
So that's a good place to do that.

1808
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,000
If you would like to follow along with a series, we also have a forum

1809
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,800
site which you can go to ask questions, we have a patreon page.

1810
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,300
You want to pledge?

1811
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,500
Support the video series.

1812
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,800
So he's much appreciated.

1813
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,000
It's always free and release to everyone for free.

1814
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,000
We also have a tweetbot that tweet the schedule at you and there's a

1815
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,100
little I button here, which if you go to the website,

1816
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,100
Light any time it'll tell you like you know in fact right now it'll

1817
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,900
tell you the next time we're going to be live so if that helps as well

1818
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,400
you can do that.

1819
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:34,700
But the Tweet Bots a good thing to subscribe to because it kind of

1820
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,500
helps, you know what the schedule going to be for the week if you want

1821
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,200
to catch it live, speaking of the schedule for the week, I will be

1822
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:47,900
back here at 5:00 tomorrow for probably throw a bunch of the more

1823
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:48,600
cutscenes in there.

1824
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,000
We should be able to get through like probably half the cutscenes

1825
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,600
tomorrow now that we've got kind of everything set up, we can just

1826
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,000
kind of do those

1827
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:57,000
All once we have them all done, we will look at how to assemble them

1828
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,800
into a full sequence and integrate that with the rest of our game.

1829
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:01,300
So that would be pretty fun.

1830
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,500
Hope to see you here for that.

1831
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,600
That's 5 p.m.

1832
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,700
tomorrow Pacific Standard time.

1833
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:11,200
Until then folks have fun programming and I will see you guys on the

1834
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:11,800
internet.

1835
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:12,600
Take it easy, everyone.
