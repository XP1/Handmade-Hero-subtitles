1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,000
Alright.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,900
Welcome to handmade hero.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,200
The show.

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
We could have complete game live on stream before we get started

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,400
today.

7
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,600
I wanted to mention something that only just got brought to my

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,900
attention, like, literally when I got home from work today.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,100
So I have not had a time had time to even address it myself at all.

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,600
But one of the fellows Matt Massacre, I don't even know how to

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,300
pronounce his name.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,300
Honestly, because on the he actually on the chat goes by me blow and

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,800
am I

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Llo, so you've probably never seen this name before on the chat

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,100
because it would not have come across as that.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,800
But me, blow whose real name is Matt bhaskaran Haas.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I don't know how you say, it started a patreon because he well, he

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,000
needed the money and he does a lot of work on the handmade Hero

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,900
episode guide.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,700
Just as a volunteer, he just like goes on there and makes them

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,800
If you don't know what that is, if you've never seen it, it's pretty

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,300
amazing.

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,900
Actually, for people who are trying to follow the series.

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,900
If you go on here, you can go to the episode guide and it's got all

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,800
the episodes on here.

26
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,300
And then when you go to stuff like this, it's got this crazy.

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,900
Like thing on the side that's like all the stuff that happened to that

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
episode, you can like access it, right.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,600
And this is kind of amazingly good because when you're trying to watch

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,700
episodes you know you might not know like oh I think there was a thing

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
in this episode about blah.

32
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,300
And it's like, oh yeah, now I know exactly just you can just click on

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,900
it, go to it.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,800
So he's one of the main people who does those things.

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,600
He's done a ton of it and so if that's something that you appreciate

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,700
having this episode guide, he's one of the people who makes that

37
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,200
happen and he put up a patreon and so you know, he definitely he

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,800
already does way more than $50 a month worth work worth of work on the

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,500
episode guide.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,300
No question.

41
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,900
I will be logging on immediately after the show, to make a pledge to

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,500
this patreon from the handmade hero patreon, because that is exactly

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,400
the kind of thing that the handmade hero patreon should be for

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,800
supporting people who are doing this.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,100
And if you are someone who appreciates Us episode guides and would

46
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,300
like to contribute to this patreon, like I said, he already does way

47
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,500
more work than this a month on those episode guide.

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,300
So, I would highly recommend kicking a few dollars his way.

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,700
I know he could use it and would really appreciate it and

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,300
I said he's one of people who makes those episodes guys happen, they

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,700
don't just happen by accident, someone's got to sit there and actually

52
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,200
look at the video and categorize everything we do in to into those

53
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,400
times and that's just a lot of work.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,700
So, check it out.

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,200
It's pretty easy to get to I think if you want to type it into your

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,100
computer, you can actually yeah.

57
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
You don't have to use whatever that is.

58
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,400
So it's literally just patreon.com, slash me.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,500
Blow will get you there.

60
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,100
I think you can just, you can just do that and then we'll get you

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,400
there.

62
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
So check that out.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,900
Out and yeah, check that.

64
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,000
And consider supporting it.

65
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,600
All right.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,900
Let's go ahead and start the episode.

67
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
So I'd Hammer here right now we're doing some user interface coding.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,500
We were doing some user interface coding because I thought would be a

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,800
good time to show how to do that.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,500
Kind of code.

71
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,300
That's something people are often very curious about how you do it.

72
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
So I showing how to do it.

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,500
And the reason I'm doing it in the place, we're doing it right now, is

74
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,800
because there's not a lot of reason to do user interface code for

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,600
handmade hero because it's not really, you know, it's not a 4X game.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,600
There's not a lot of toolbars and a lot of dialog boxes or things like

77
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,700
that.

78
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,100
And handmade here, it's an action game.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,600
So what I'm doing is I'm taking the opportunity to do some user

80
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
interface code while we were doing our debug viewers.

81
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,900
So basically like our thing that views debug information that is the

82
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,700
thing that I'm sort of working on there and we've gotten relatively

83
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,500
far with it.

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,200
We're at the point where we can do some pretty cool stuff with it but

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,100
there's more to do.

86
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,600
And so I want to kind of jump back in there to it today is day 20 for

87
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,300
again, this is all coding today so if you want to follow along at home

88
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
and you have pre-ordered the game on handmade hero dot org, you can

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,700
Follow along by unpacking day two or three source code into a

90
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,100
directory.

91
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,000
That's the source code that I'm starting with right now.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So if you want to follow along home, you start with that as your

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,800
basis, okay?

94
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,899
So let's take a look here.

95
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,100
Where we are at.

96
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,800
So here is

97
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,300
Our debug system and here is it running.

98
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,100
And when we left it last we kind of have this little thing in here

99
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,500
where we, you know, we sort of had our little, a little test stuff.

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,600
And we what we recently did is add the ability to have sort of

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,900
multiple versions of a hierarchy and track the state of them

102
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,000
separately so that we can kind of, you know, have have more than one

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
state of the hierarchy.

104
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,200
So, you know, if we want to have just the render, a

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,700
Out here whatever all of these are tracked as independent states.

106
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,400
So when we are accessing them if we want it closed or you know on some

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,700
and open on others, that's totally allowed and and isn't at all a

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,900
problem for our system.

109
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,300
So basically what we did with the system was make it so that you know

110
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,600
we decouple the concept of the state of the hierarchy from the actual

111
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,700
hierarchy itself so that you know we don't have to worry about kind of

112
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,200
like coupling this the the sort of interaction.

113
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
With the thing that's being interacted with and that's just something

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
that I thought would be interesting to do so we did it.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,900
Now what I'd like to do today is I'd like to start because we're

116
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,300
getting relatively close here.

117
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I feel like on our debug sort of hierarchy View.

118
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,700
What I'd like to do is I'd like to start looking at the actual

119
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,700
representation of the debug variables themselves because what I'd like

120
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,000
to do is kind of make one more leap with the infrastructure with a

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,800
debug infrastructure to a place, I think is pretty important right

122
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,100
now.

123
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,800
What we're doing is these hierarchies the underlying

124
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Data for these hierarchies is explicitly constructed and explicitly

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,500
exists all the time, right?

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,000
When I mean by that, is that, if you are to look in the code, right,

127
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,900
where we've got, we've got these sort of, debug variable types and all

128
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,400
that sort of thing.

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
If you are to look in the code, you can actually see us construct

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,200
right here, the actual, you know, version of this hierarchy.

131
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,800
We've constructed it and it exists in memory, right?

132
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,200
And what that means is that anything that we want to edit right now

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,200
has to actually exist in memory as a real debug hierarchy, right?

134
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,400
That's explicitly constructed as as a thing as a real, you know,

135
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
living entity.

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,800
And one of the problems with that is it makes it kind of annoying

137
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,500
potentially and there's different ways that we can look about.

138
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,300
Look at this, but it makes it kind of annoying potentially for code

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,700
that wants to use this to quickly expose debug

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,900
Goes to the system because now it's kind of a retained mode thing,

141
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,700
where anyone who wants to expose debug variables, has to kind of go

142
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,000
through the trouble of actually creating them and putting them

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,400
somewhere.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,500
Now, that's not a big deal for Global's because for Global's, it's the

145
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:15,800
same.

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,700
It's six of one half dozen of the other because things like whether or

147
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,800
not the ground shook out lines are used is just a global switch that

148
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
turns on and off.

149
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,200
It doesn't really matter how we expose that because all it means is

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,700
that whatever that Boolean is or however it's defined.

151
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,200
We're just going to make one of these things eventually and then

152
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
forget about it and it's something that the debug system could always

153
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,400
use from then on and there's really no mystery to it.

154
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,500
But what I'm a little more interested in is the more complex problem

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,900
of things where the game has to fit wants to expose and it doesn't

156
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,400
necessarily want to do the work of creating an actual

157
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,400
Explicit debug tree for something.

158
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,900
When it, you know, that thing maybe kind of inconvenient, we don't

159
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,200
want to look inject, the, you know, we don't want to force it to kind

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,900
of have to store things or manage things.

161
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,200
We want to just kind of work.

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,400
And so, what I'd like to do now, is take a kind of a brief

163
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,700
Sort of look at what we could do in terms of making that sort of thing

164
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
work a little bit better, right?

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,300
And so the thing that we probably most want to be able to do in the

166
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,400
game is we'd like to be able to do something like inspect and entity,

167
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,100
right.

168
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,800
It would be nice to be able to inspect like what the values of an

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,200
entity are, for example, because that's something that can be

170
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,900
relatively difficult to do in the debugger because we don't really

171
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:40,299
know what entity is what and it's kind of hard to let go.

172
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,100
Oh, I see, you know, there's any that's misbehaving over there.

173
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,900
I don't know why I like, how do I see what the state of it?

174
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,300
Is that something that might be kind of a nice thing to add to our

175
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,500
system, right?

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,500
So I'd like to do today is start down that path and I'm going to

177
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,900
forget entirely about the debug code.

178
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,700
We've already written.

179
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,700
And instead, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go do what I want to

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,800
do.

181
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,900
To the editi code, to make it possible to inspect those variables,

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,100
right?

183
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,400
And then I'm going to go back to the debug system and make and unify

184
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
those two, right?

185
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,700
So this is again, a very standard programming technique.

186
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,300
For me, it's something I do very often which is if I know that there

187
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:26,800
is a particular sort of operation or tasks that I want a system to do.

188
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,200
I will go, right, the usage code for that task.

189
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
The thing that's going to use that system.

190
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll write that before writing the system and then let that sort of

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,100
How the system works, right?

192
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,900
And in this case, we've already done some of that because we did like

193
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,100
kind of what we wanted for pound defines, but like I said, we've never

194
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,600
really looked at this other use case.

195
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,900
So I want to write that use case and then let that drive.

196
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,500
How I upgrade this system to support it rather than sort of changing

197
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,000
the system in hopes that it will support that well and then going and

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,300
using it and finding out that I was wrong, right?

199
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,800
You might as well if you know what you want to do.

200
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,300
Do go do it and let that inform how the system is written.

201
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,300
It's a much more efficient way to make that work.

202
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,500
Okay.

203
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,000
So if we were going to do something like that, let's go over to

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,100
handmade same region.

205
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
That's where we deal with our entities, a lot.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,700
So I'm just going to kind of look in here and see how we're doing

207
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,400
that.

208
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,800
And so you can kind of see as I go through this this stuff when we

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
we've got kind of, our begins intense em situation.

210
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,800
And when we do begin Sim, we Loop through all of the entities that are

211
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
in the sauce.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,600
The region that we're working on and we add them to the simulation.

213
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,500
Right, you can see that happening here.

214
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,700
And so if we do something like this where we go through and we add any

215
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,700
of these to the simulation, it's sort of an interesting question of,

216
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,800
you know, maybe is that the right place for us to announce an entity

217
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,000
or not, you know, it's kind of hard to say but what I do know is that

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,700
after we've added all these entities to the Sim, we have sort of an

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,500
easy way potentially now to pick them.

220
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,100
And so, what I'd like to do is do something where I can

221
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,400
Ask the same region, you know, using the mouse or something, I can go

222
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,300
like click on it, empty or something like that and pick that entity.

223
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,700
So now we know you know that you know what that entity actually is in

224
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,700
terms of like, you know, it's entity ID or whatever.

225
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,000
Right?

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So this we know who it is.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,900
So that's what we're going to do.

228
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,500
Today is the ability to like pick that Andy and take a look at how

229
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,200
that might work.

230
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,900
So inside the begin Sim when we do all this sort of stuff when we add

231
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,500
things to the Sim you can see that what we do here is we kind of put

232
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,900
them in like this and then we have a SIM entity Collision volume group

233
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,600
and that Collision volume group tells us like the bounds of that

234
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
entity, right?

235
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,000
And that's really all we know about the boundaries of that entity for

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
the most part.

237
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,400
At least I remember correctly.

238
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I think that's all we know.

239
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,700
We might have an extra thing in there which is like some kind of a

240
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,300
radius.

241
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,900
But I don't actually remember.

242
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,100
I think all we really have is the Collision stuff, and in fact, when

243
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,700
we do like move entity, right, I'm pretty sure when we do move entity

244
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,100
that inserts things into the set, right?

245
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Something like that.

246
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,300
Here, that kind of inserts things into the set specifically by using

247
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,800
that Collision volume, I believe, right.

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,400
Right, because when we write when we insert things oh no.

249
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,500
I guess that's not true.

250
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,400
When we insert things we don't actually care about their bounds.

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
We just use their position and put them in that way.

252
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,600
I think, right?

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,400
I think that's actually the case.

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,100
But we do know that least for most entities we will have that

255
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Collision volume so we could start with something like that and say

256
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,000
that we'll just use the Collision volume.

257
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,500
We could also do something where we use just the position itself and

258
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
use the position.

259
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,700
I had to pick you know so we could click near the position into it I'm

260
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,300
not sure which of those would be the best way to go but you know

261
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,500
either way

262
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,600
Either way, we have some options, let's put it that way.

263
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,900
So if I wanted deal with something like that, the first thing that I'd

264
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,800
like to do is draw those collisions volume, so that we can see them.

265
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,900
Because so far as for like, you know, if you take a look at what we've

266
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,700
got drawn on here, right?

267
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,300
I'm going to turn off the debug camera for now.

268
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,600
If you look at what we've got drawn on here, we've kind of have this.

269
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,300
This situation where, you know what I guess I've got room based camera

270
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:35,700
as well.

271
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,300
There we go.

272
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,300
So we can have the situation where we don't actually see, you know,

273
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
we've got any of these and they have collisions like I can't walk

274
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,800
through, you know, this dude or whatever but we don't actually ever

275
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
see what those Collision volumes are right.

276
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,500
Like those Collision volumes aren't actually drawn in any way.

277
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,300
So what I'd like to do is just have some way of drawing.

278
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,700
Those Collision volumes onto the screen in a way that I can actually

279
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
perceive that, you know, that I'd actually be able to

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,100
To see and look at.

281
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,300
And in order to do that I think we may have to introduce, you know we

282
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
might introduce something even like a line primitive or something,

283
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
because I'm not sure that there's really a lot of good ways to do it.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,300
I suppose we could do it with our rectangle but it's a little bit

285
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,600
tricky to even know how to do it.

286
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,400
Exactly what the rectangle even because well both of the points of the

287
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
rectangle would have to be projected and blah blah blah.

288
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,900
So I'm not entirely sure but let's take a look.

289
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,700
So in the sentiment of the Collision fighting group, you can see we've

290
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
got Collision volumes.

291
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,600
And basically what they are is there's like an offset.

292
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
And a dim, right?

293
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,900
So it's basically like a cure is, you know, here's my, my positioning

294
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,300
my placement, for it relative, the entities position, and then I've

295
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
got sort of a dimension.

296
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,100
The says how big it is, right?

297
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,700
And so if I kind of go into the renderer, we don't really have

298
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
anything that can do a rendering like that.

299
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,000
You know, we've got a bility to push a rectangle and we can push a

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,700
rectangle out of 3D offset, but when we specify the dimension, the

301
00:14:59,700 --> 00:14:59,900
dimension

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is not specified in 3D and that way, it's specified in 2D, right?

303
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,700
So we wouldn't actually even see what that that rectangular really

304
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,200
was.

305
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,500
And so what we might want to do you know, one thing we can consider

306
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,400
doing certainly

307
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,200
Is doing something where we actually have a rectangle call.

308
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,900
That makes a rectangle that takes like two points in 3D and then fills

309
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,200
the rectangle like around those points, or something like that, right?

310
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
Or something that takes yet basically, something that would allow us

311
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,200
to more easily, draw those things and push wrecked outline, might be

312
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
the better one for it too.

313
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,600
Because push wrecked outline is we probably don't want to do solid

314
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,900
blocks for our Collision or tails.

315
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,400
Probably just drawing the boundary.

316
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Maybe it's a little bit more.

317
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,400
Interesting, right, so let's just start off with something really

318
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,000
easy.

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,100
Let's start off with something where when we do the same entities and

320
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,800
that's tough.

321
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Let's go into

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Hand me dot CPP.

323
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,500
I think we've got a render Loop here, where you can see the render

324
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,800
Loop working its way through here.

325
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,900
And so, as we're going through these renderings, I feel like what we

326
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,800
could do is at the end of this, right?

327
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,900
If we wanted to after everything, we're we're doing all these sort of

328
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,100
push Rex what I could do at the very end of it is I could go through

329
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,900
the Collision volumes.

330
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,800
In fact, right here, you can even see us having done this before,

331
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,600
right?

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,300
What I could do is say all right, let's take this code for drawing.

333
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,200
Outlines of things, and let's just do that for all the entities right

334
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,100
that there are.

335
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
So Eve, No Matter What entity it was, I'll just come down here and

336
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,600
I'll draw that that wrecked outline, right?

337
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
So, this should work for any of it.

338
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I think, for the most part, oops, know how that happened.

339
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,500
How did that get in there?

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,100
When did that get in there?

341
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,900
I don't even know.

342
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:06,300
So yeah, point being, let's go grab that their Collision.

343
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,599
Where did you go?

344
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,599
Do you like you, I use face outline.

345
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,400
So, all I really want to do now is make one of these.

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,500
That's like, you know, in our config file.

347
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,200
For example, I want to do something where it's like, you know, draw

348
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,400
entity outlines

349
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,099
But I like that.

350
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,300
And I don't know where that'll go, but we're going to put it in there.

351
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,200
Let's take a look.

352
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm going to find that as one and I'm going to go into our debug

353
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,800
variables that H.

354
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,900
I'm going to put that.

355
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,100
Where is that going to go?

356
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,100
We don't really have anything.

357
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,100
I guess we'll just have what a new group.

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't know.

359
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,700
And these something like that.

360
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,700
And then we'll do fine one of them.

361
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Did my favorite list thing?

362
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,800
Raw energy.

363
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,900
Outlines.

364
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,900
Compile.

365
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,200
So there are, you know, some of the outlines for the different Eddie's

366
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
and you can kind of see that it's roughly.

367
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,100
Correct, right.

368
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,400
And we're just using that that same

369
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
Code for it that we were using before.

370
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,300
It's a little thick, I feel like and I'm not sure it's the dim XY,

371
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,100
it's just ignoring the Z bounds.

372
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,900
So that's how we were drawing it before.

373
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,100
And, you know, that's probably fine at the end of the day.

374
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,800
You know, that's that's probably good enough for our purposes and all

375
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,300
that, I wish it was a little less thick.

376
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,100
I do Wonder.

377
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:42,300
Perhaps if maybe our push wrecked outline, does that actually support

378
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,600
the ability to to do a thickness?

379
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,600
It doesn't seem too.

380
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,300
So we might want to do something where we, you know, allowed that to

381
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,600
sort of get passed in like this.

382
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,700
So that when we do a push wrecked outline and we're showing these

383
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,800
things that we're looking at here, we could also say, oh, you know

384
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
what could you just if you could just make that a little thinner?

385
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
That'd be great, right?

386
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,900
And so, there's those lovely.

387
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
They are really pretty beautiful.

388
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,900
There's a nice magenta outline there, right?

389
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,900
All good.

390
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's pretty good.

391
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,300
Pretty good.

392
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,200
So now we can kind of see those boundaries on the screen and so now

393
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
what I want to do is make it so that we can actually pick with the

394
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
mouse one of those boundaries.

395
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
So that when we're moving the mouse on the screen around like we can

396
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,600
click on one and say I want to highlight this entity, right?

397
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Like this is the entity that I want to select if that makes sense,

398
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,400
right?

399
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,100
All right, so if I wanted to pick one of those guys, if I wanted to,

400
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,600
like, make sure that I could, you know, could do that.

401
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:48,900
Really?

402
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,600
All I need to do is be able to see whether my mouse cursor is inside.

403
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,500
One of those rectangles just like we were doing before, right?

404
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,200
We could we could easily do that.

405
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,700
The problem is, remember we have a transform on our view here.

406
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,800
We like I mean right just to put a fine point to put not too fine, a

407
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,400
point on it.

408
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,500
As I might say I can

409
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,100
Change.

410
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Like, for example, this to use the debug camera and everything like

411
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,800
shrinks down, right?

412
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:23,000
So obviously there is not just some canonical like coordinate system

413
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,400
that this is all in at render time.

414
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,900
It's actually taking the world and it's like taking where the camera

415
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,200
is and it's producing where all of the entities are through a

416
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,900
projection like we talked about.

417
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,600
So in order for my mouse to know what it is over, in order for me to

418
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,500
figure out what the mouse is over.

419
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,700
Over in the in the actual game world, we need to basically do an

420
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,800
inversion, right?

421
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,300
We need to reverse the process that the renderer is going through.

422
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,700
That's taking things from the world and putting it on the screen

423
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,400
because the mouse is on the screen and we need to reverse it to put it

424
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,300
into the world.

425
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Does that make sense?

426
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,600
And we didn't have to do that for hit testing for our debug UI because

427
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,100
the debug UI is not in the game world, right?

428
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,900
When we scale the game world, there's no transform on the debug you.

429
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
I, it's just 121 pixels, right?

430
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,400
So the pixels, the mouse cursor, where the mouse cursor is in pixels

431
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,800
and where these things are in pixels is the same thing.

432
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,500
Right?

433
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,400
So it's all in the same space and just works.

434
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,400
But if we wanted to hit test these things on the screen, because

435
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,900
they're going through that camera transform, which again is something

436
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,800
we can set and control and change.

437
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,500
Then we're going to have to have some way of reversing it, right?

438
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,200
And I think I almost want to say, I don't remember if this is if this

439
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,600
is the case or not, I want to say we sort of started this process for

440
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,700
a different reason.

441
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,200
I think, yeah, right here, right.

442
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,600
So we have unprojected, let's see here.

443
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Want to see where that's being called, so we have on Project and we're

444
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,700
using that.

445
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,200
Well,

446
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,900
We're not using it at all.

447
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,500
So we have one project which is just a way of taking something that's

448
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
in the

449
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,200
I guess it's not really a 2d location.

450
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,800
No, we are using it.

451
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Okay, there it is.

452
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,300
Get camera rectangle at distance, right?

453
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,500
So what we're doing there is essentially, we're saying okay, we would

454
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:42,000
like to take whatever our monitor is right, whatever, we know the

455
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,300
monitor Dimension is, we want to unprojected that so that we know how

456
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,500
what the camera can see, right?

457
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,300
So that we did have a good reason for it so we already have the

458
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
ability to unprojected something.

459
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,000
So if we

460
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,300
What we could run this projected X Y function on our Mouse coordinates

461
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,200
and in theory will get back right what that position in the world

462
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,500
would be now as you know or I shouldn't even necessarily say as you

463
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,900
know.

464
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
But I'll draw it out you just in case, it's not clear.

465
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,100
if I was to talk about,

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,300
The position of the mouse on the screen and let's just draw this

467
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,700
again.

468
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,600
So here's here's the focal point.

469
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,700
And you know, we're talking about something out in the world here.

470
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,800
Like here's the tree, right?

471
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,000
And this is the monitor.

472
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,700
And as you know, when we do our projections, like we take some point

473
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,900
on the tree, we project it onto the screen, right?

474
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,000
And this this tree, the whole tree point at a time, gets kind of

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,700
projected onto their.

476
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,700
If you think about it that way, thought about all the points on the

477
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,600
tree, they all have sort of lines that intersect the monitor that's

478
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,500
where we're sort of talking about them being.

479
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
Now if we want to do

480
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Verse of this, if we have a point here and we go, where in the world

481
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,000
is it?

482
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:09,700
Well, what you could immediately see is, there isn't a single point in

483
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,700
the world that corresponds to a single point.

484
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,000
On the screen, it's actually a family of points along a line, right?

485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Anything along this line from the focal point to the point on the

486
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,900
screen and out into the world.

487
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,700
Anything along that line is going to map to the same point on the

488
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,200
screen.

489
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Right.

490
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,800
So that's why we need one additional value, which is the distance from

491
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,800
the camera that we want it to be.

492
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,900
So if the cameras here, right?

493
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,800
And that's where we're sort of looking along, and this is the point on

494
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,400
the screen.

495
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,100
What we need to know is What's the total distance?

496
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,400
This way, like What's the total distance along that line, right?

497
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,700
In that along that line, I shouldn't say What's the total distance

498
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,000
like for this plane, if this

499
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,000
He was to be pushed back, right?

500
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,600
What's the total distance from the camera to the actual plane we're

501
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,900
talking about and then it will find that piece, right?

502
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,400
And we know what that is, we know what that is because that's the

503
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,100
camera.

504
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,500
That's that's what the actual.

505
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,100
Ground like distance is.

506
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,200
So when we're picking we could we could just use how far away that is,

507
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,900
but

508
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,600
It does get a little more complicated than that, in some sense if we

509
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,700
want to think about it, think it through a little bit more deeply,

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,500
right?

511
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:38,200
So, the other thing we could think about the other way to sort of

512
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,500
conceptualize, this is when we are picking something, we don't

513
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,400
necessarily know what plane we might want to be picking, right?

514
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
Because when we look at things, you know, if we had some things

515
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,000
stacked on top of each other.

516
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
So back here, there's me no more trees in the distance or something.

517
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,900
So it draws like an there, we might want to have it so that as we are

518
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,700
looking through these entities we are taking like whichever ones close

519
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,600
to the camera or maybe want to know all of the entities that intersect

520
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,700
it and select all the things that are under the mouse cursor because

521
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,300
they're going to be more than one, right?

522
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
And so another way to think of it would be to say, Well when we're

523
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,300
picking, we're really just talking about maybe like this line we're

524
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,800
talking about, we want to know what the entities are, the intersect

525
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
this line, right?

526
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
And that's a slightly more

527
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,800
Answer way to think about it.

528
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,200
And it's a way that's a little bit more complicated a program because

529
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,000
then what you have to do is when you look through entities, you kind

530
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,100
of have to go like would they, you know, where are they relative to

531
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,200
the camera, do the intersection and then go, okay, is would that

532
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,500
intersection have been the closest one, or whatever?

533
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,300
But it's still not particularly onerous for us to do so, I think

534
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
that's probably what I will.

535
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,100
Just go ahead and Implement, right.

536
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,500
And so, our goal for today is to make it so that as I move this mouse,

537
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Surround, I want to basically like change this color, right?

538
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
This color here, I want to

539
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,900
Just color to, let's say yellow.

540
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,900
Whenever I am over an entity so that I can see that I'm like, picking

541
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,700
them correctly.

542
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,700
That makes sense.

543
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,100
So, in order to do that, I should be able to do something fairly

544
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,200
straightforward, like, doing unprojected.

545
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,800
We'll try this first.

546
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,000
So I'm going to go here and say, you know, is highlighted

547
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,200
equals false or maybe I'll just even go the for outline color.

548
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Right, equals that lovely magenta and then I'll say like if some stuff

549
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:40,500
is true will have outline color equal to like a lovely yellow instead.

550
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,600
So what I want to do here is I'm going to unprotect the mouse.

551
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,000
And I'm going to unprotect the mouse for the render group that we're

552
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,600
using.

553
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,500
And I'm going to take whatever the mouse key is here, right?

554
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,500
And then I'm and we got to make sure that that's in our reasonable

555
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,800
coordinate system, obviously.

556
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,600
So we're going to take a look at that.

557
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,100
Sort of in a second.

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,300
But anyway, we've got a mouse P there and then we've got distance from

559
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,700
camera.

560
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,400
And what we want to do for distance of camera is we want to take

561
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
however far the entity is away.

562
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,600
So we're going to look at how far it is on its plane of existence,

563
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,100
right?

564
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:25,100
So I'm going to take a look at, like the entities total position in

565
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
space, right?

566
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,000
And again, that's going to be relative to the camera already.

567
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,400
Because everything in this, in this case is going is represented

568
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,700
relative.

569
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,400
Camera.

570
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,300
Now, the only problem is something I don't

571
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,300
Actually, remember, about the way we were doing this is I don't

572
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,000
actually remember.

573
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,500
What we set up for the camera Point per se.

574
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,600
But you can see here that if this is what we're actually passing that

575
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
we must have set up the camera correctly originally

576
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
We're sending the ground Point here.

577
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,500
So I'm just going to take whatever we're doing there that offset P.

578
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm going to assume that that's the picking plane that we want to be

579
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,400
in for now, right?

580
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
So, I'm just going to say this, oops.

581
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,100
The Z of this.

582
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,900
Is what we want.

583
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,700
Okay.

584
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,400
And so then I'm going to say well okay after I unprojected this thing,

585
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,900
this is my like local Mouse P or whatever.

586
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,000
Then I can just sort of say, well, whatever I was going to draw right

587
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,900
for my, for my

588
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Collision volume here.

589
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,300
Right.

590
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,600
I've got some some 2D volume that I'm sort of projecting here for my

591
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
push worked out line.

592
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,000
I should be able to take whatever that rectangle is and and and see

593
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,700
whether I collide with it, right?

594
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,000
So if I take this dim x y and I assume this dim XY is centered around

595
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,800
the Collision volume and I could do this per Collision value, in fact,

596
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,700
Could do this whole thing per Collision volume, if I wanted to, I

597
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,900
guess, I could say, I could do it in here like this.

598
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,500
And I should probably actually make sure I use that outline color.

599
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,000
Right.

600
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,600
So you can see here I've got the volume offset P so I could just use

601
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,800
that volume offset p and say, okay for the particular volume, whatever

602
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
its Z is at.

603
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,100
I'm going to run project that

604
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,400
And then I'm going to see whether this thing is inside the rectangle,

605
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,000
sort of defined by this Dimension, right?

606
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,400
And I guess actually I could also do it just by checking the well, I'm

607
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,000
not going to bother

608
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah, if that's the local Mass P.

609
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,500
That's the one that's like you know, in the same space as our entity

610
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,100
basically.

611
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,000
So what I should be able to do their say, you know, I've got the

612
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,100
volumes Dimension.

613
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,000
So I could just say, okay, if the local Mouse pee,

614
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,900
The volumes Dimension, you know, X and the volume is offset.

615
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,300
P.

616
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,500
You know what?

617
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,200
I can even make this little simpler after unprojected it.

618
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,700
I could even just make it relative to the offset P, right?

619
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,700
So basically what I'm doing here is saying, okay, let's find out

620
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:20,600
relative to the center of this this Collision volume, where is the

621
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,300
local Mouse, once I know where that is, I can just say, okay if the

622
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,300
local Mouse peas X is greater than like the negative dimension.

623
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,800
She now that I think about it.

624
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
How are we drawing this?

625
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,900
This is like a centre-half damn thing.

626
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,600
Right.

627
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,400
Pretty sure.

628
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,200
Yeah.

629
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,500
So if it's if it's, you know, greater than half the dimension,

630
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
And less than half a dimension.

631
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,300
right, and then I do the same thing with why

632
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,900
like so I now know,

633
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,700
Exactly.

634
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,000
What's you know whether or not this thing is inside or outside that 2D

635
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,700
volume and this is not a full 3d test against the volume but that's

636
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,100
probably okay for our purposes.

637
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,800
Like I said if we want to be a little more ridiculous about it, we

638
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,100
could do ray intersects 3D cube a 3D you know, right.

639
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,700
Rectangular prism but there's really no need for that for the debug

640
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,300
picking certainly.

641
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,300
So probably seems like that would be a bit of a waste of time to say

642
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,400
the least but

643
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,600
So let's go ahead and Loops gotta dereference that above where I use

644
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,200
it certainly.

645
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
So let's go ahead and see if we can make our Mouse P here.

646
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,800
Look at that.

647
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,400
We still controlling the Music Volume.

648
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,700
That's probably not what we want for now.

649
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,500
So we've got the input Mouse X and the input Mouse.

650
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,000
Why?

651
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,300
but,

652
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Those again are sort of what the what the system tells us.

653
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,300
The mouse X where the mouse is and so on.

654
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,000
And so since, you know, rather than try to always remember exactly

655
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,300
where the system thinks the mouse is what I'd like to do.

656
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,900
Also, start is I'd like to do a push wrecked of the mouse's location

657
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
so we can see what we think it actually is.

658
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,400
Right.

659
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,800
And so what I can do there is temporarily, you know, again without

660
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:25,600
actually actually having to do anything too fancy.

661
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,500
Here I should be able to take some of the places where

662
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,200
During stuff, which is after the controller stuff happens.

663
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
So, when we start doing this here, like this stuff here, right?

664
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,800
We've got this perspective transform after I unprojected the mouse, I

665
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,500
could show words.

666
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,300
I'd like to show prior to projecting as well where it is.

667
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,300
So I'd have to think, I guess I'd have to make an orthographic

668
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,600
projection first, but that's not really a big, big deal, right?

669
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,200
So what I could do is right here where we've got this sort of stuff.

670
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,300
What I could do is do an orthographic beforehand, just to draw the

671
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,800
mouse right?

672
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,900
Because in here, you know, we

673
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,699
Did did that, right?

674
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:12,500
We did this.

675
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,800
So if I wanted to, I could do do one of these

676
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,699
Don't actually remember what this 1.0 thing is, if that's just the

677
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,800
scale factor, right?

678
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:27,900
So if I did that, now I could actually draw wherever the mouse is so I

679
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,199
can just say, okay there's a mouse P, right?

680
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,300
That's the input.

681
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,199
How sex the input Mouse, why?

682
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,400
And once I have that, I can do a push wrecked outline if I want to.

683
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,000
Now, again, I should probably also move the clear up a bit, right?

684
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,400
The clear should happen before all this, but I don't actually the

685
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,000
clear.

686
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't remember if that clears the whole surface, or just this part

687
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,700
of it.

688
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,500
But yeah, I guess I can do it this way.

689
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,000
That's probably fine.

690
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,600
so when I clear this thing after I do the input mousex mess, why I can

691
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,700
then push a rectangle on here and if I do push wrecked outline

692
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,900
There we go.

693
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,800
I should be able to see where the mouse actually is before we do

694
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
anything with it, right?

695
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,000
So if we just go ahead and make one of these guys and then we have the

696
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,800
dimension of it.

697
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,200
I don't know, which will just be like a two-by-two thing.

698
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,500
Fashion show us.

699
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,700
Where are we?

700
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,300
We think the mouse cursor is before we try to do anything more fancy

701
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,800
than that.

702
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,700
All right.

703
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Well you know what I probably need to draw that after because I saw it

704
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,100
there it actually worked but going to have to do that afterwards.

705
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,800
So this should probably as

706
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Be kind of doubt the bottom after we do everything else so we can

707
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,000
actually see it.

708
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,000
All right, Mouse pee.

709
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,600
First Mouse be itself.

710
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,400
Can certainly be something that we do early.

711
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,400
That's all fine.

712
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,700
Okay.

713
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,100
So let's see if this works now, Mouse pee.

714
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,200
And, you know, the other thing that I have to do is reset the render

715
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,800
transform the offset p

716
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,500
This guy render group transform and I don't remember if we have some

717
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,100
way of setting the dredger transform to the identity.

718
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,700
I don't actually remember, if that's something we did.

719
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's take a look.

720
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,800
I feel like that's something we would want, certainly.

721
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,100
Perspective or the graphic.

722
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,800
And you can see that those like don't get set right, like the offset P

723
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,100
doesn't get set here and I wonder if they probably should clear it?

724
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:10,000
You would think I feel like they kind of should because if you look at

725
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
what is in the transform, it's got the offset p in the scale and those

726
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,600
don't get touched by these.

727
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,300
But I kind of feel like they should

728
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,000
Right?

729
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,300
I feel like that's something where you kind of want.

730
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,000
Those to be set.

731
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,300
Maybe I'm wrong about that.

732
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,100
It's kind of feels like what it should be to me.

733
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,100
Yeah.

734
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,300
So anyway, you can see our little mouse is there now.

735
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,800
So now I've at least verified that it's accurate, which is what I

736
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,100
wanted, right.

737
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,400
But I think that also I don't actually know like I say in the

738
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,500
orthographic mode, I don't actually know that.

739
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,100
I'm interpreting that Mouse, right?

740
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,700
In a way that, you know, I don't know if that's actually in the

741
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,600
projective space secure and I'm not sure.

742
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,700
So I want to take a look at that those values.

743
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,200
So for example, when it's up here, right?

744
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,400
I'd like to know what it actually is, like, what's the actual value

745
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,600
when it's up here?

746
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,500
So, like right now, for example, what I might do is just break into

747
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,600
the code somewhere doesn't matter where game update and render.

748
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
And I want to see what mouse p is set to, right?

749
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I just want to see what, what it whoops, what it ends up being, and I

750
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,900
want to actually search for it.

751
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,300
If possible, find earned quick, find mouse pee.

752
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,400
We go.

753
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,100
And so, what's the value?

754
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:55,500
so the x value is negative 9 34 and the Y value is 511, so it looks

755
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,900
like they the the coordinate system for the mouse is in

756
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,800
The screen coordinate system, right?

757
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,100
So that seems to me to be totally reasonable, right?

758
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,900
So now, what I'd like to do is step it up one notch.

759
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,700
I'd like to go ahead and say that when we are doing these debug and of

760
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:24,100
the outlines, I'd like to now also draw sort of the local P, right?

761
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,200
I'd like to

762
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,400
That actually save.

763
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,300
Hey, I hate it.

764
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,300
When Visual Studio saved my file, I wish you can turn Visual Studio to

765
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,600
never save anything.

766
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,000
To just only be in debugger, not an editor would be nice.

767
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,000
So when I Loop over these volumes that I do, this, look a mouse p&i

768
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,400
unprojected thing back into the world.

769
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,600
What I want to do now is I want to be able to draw that Mouse p as

770
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,000
well.

771
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,800
So we're whatever that local version is you know I'm saying.

772
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,400
So I want to basically say, like, okay, once I've been projected it, I

773
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,000
should be able to

774
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,500
Draw it again, after I compute.

775
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,100
Where it is, I should be able to say.

776
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,900
Okay, I've got the local Mouse pee

777
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,800
And if I were to turn that into a 3D thing using again, the sort of

778
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,900
the Z value.

779
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,600
So, you know, something like local Z.

780
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,400
That's my local Z value.

781
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,900
Assuming that I was to draw it.

782
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,900
Where would it be?

783
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,100
And I'm going to draw that as a bigger one here.

784
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,200
I'm going to draw that as, you know, something that I can can tell

785
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,500
what it is, so maybe like, 1.0 or 0000, just nice cyan there,

786
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,800
something like that.

787
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,700
And then I want to look and see if I can see that.

788
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,600
And if I can see that like, where it even is right, and I'm not seeing

789
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,100
it anywhere.

790
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,200
No.

791
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,200
That should have been, that should be happening for like every entity,

792
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,000
right?

793
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,400
And I'm not seeing it at all.

794
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:51,800
So,

795
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,300
Obviously thinking about this slightly wrong, I'm not, I'm not

796
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,300
properly doing what I should be doing here.

797
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,700
You know what I'm saying?

798
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,200
So something's amiss and I'm not sure what I'm looping through the

799
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,300
volumes, I'm using whatever the volume Z is as the reverse projector,

800
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,100
I'm taking, whatever the X and Y is of the volume and I'm subtracting

801
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:18,600
it away.

802
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,800
So this should be local to the entities like

803
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,500
Roughly local to the entities P.

804
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,400
It's not quite because it's the volumes fee, but even so, it should be

805
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,300
pretty close and so I should see something nearby to the cursor when

806
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,200
I'm over an entity.

807
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
And that is definitely not happening.

808
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,100
So I would like to know why that's not happening.

809
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,900
We take another quick, look down here.

810
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,200
Just so I make sure I know what I'm actually debugging.

811
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,300
So the way that we worked that out is we take the distance from

812
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,800
camera.

813
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
We divide the

814
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
by the focal length and we multiply that by the projected x y

815
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,100
By that value.

816
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,400
and so in theory yet, that would make it

817
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
so that I think,

818
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,400
Just thinking that through a little bit.

819
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Right, that I think actually doesn't go to pixels is our problem.

820
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,000
Right.

821
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,300
like if we look at what actually happens there,

822
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,600
That's not going to actually get us to pixels, looking at our get

823
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,300
entity or basis P.

824
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,400
Right?

825
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Looking at get render entity basis B, when we do our transform here,

826
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
you can sort of see

827
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,800
But after we do that projection, which you can see us doing right

828
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,200
here.

829
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,700
After we do our projected X Y, we do a transform of m, 2 pixels.

830
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:30,400
And so I feel like that, m 2 pixels is the problem.

831
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,300
You can see uh Sun projecting monitor half, demand M here.

832
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,700
So we would first need to, when we do this on a project, we would

833
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:43,000
first need to unprojected it like using the beaters to pixel value,

834
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:43,900
right?

835
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,300
So, I mean, I just for right now, I mean, I could sort of do that

836
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,900
directly.

837
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,700
We have this mouse P, the

838
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,000
He's already in M, the mouse p is not.

839
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,600
So we have M to pixels, right?

840
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:03,300
So what we could do is take pixels to M and multiply it.

841
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,900
And then we could go ahead and oops.

842
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,800
And then we'd be, we'd be going ahead and doing the the conversion

843
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,100
there.

844
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,700
Now looks like m 2 pixels.

845
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,100
It looks like we never actually did that one.

846
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,400
We only have M to pixels.

847
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,300
Not pixels to meters, but that's okay.

848
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,800
I can divide by it as well.

849
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,400
That's totally fine.

850
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,900
Or I should say multiply it by the inverse.

851
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,400
L, 2 pixels.

852
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,300
It's not, so it's a property of the transform.

853
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,400
Sorry.

854
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,500
My bad.

855
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,100
Okay.

856
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:03,900
Oh my

857
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,000
I can't say I know what's going on there.

858
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,000
Push wrecked line.

859
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,600
Local Mouse pee.

860
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,300
Is that oh, that's actually these.

861
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:21,500
All right.

862
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,200
Well,

863
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, I forgot about the fact that this would actually get Scaled up.

864
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,500
That's my bad.

865
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,900
Yeah.

866
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,200
So probably want to cut that down quite a bit.

867
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,300
Yeah, because that's now in.

868
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,500
That's a m.

869
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,600
Yeah.

870
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:42,800
Okay.

871
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,500
Well we're getting there though.

872
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,400
We are getting there.

873
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,400
And looks like

874
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,700
Oddly enough were kind of either all in or all out on some of these so

875
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,300
that we're kind of, we're still a little bit janky but we're getting

876
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,400
there, right?

877
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,000
Like, you can see that no matter what the mouse is.

878
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,500
I'm sort of not actually these are not actually offsetting relative to

879
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,100
each other, their offsetting relative to their BC, all the same

880
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:17,300
offset, but it should be different per individual bounding element,

881
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,300
but we're getting closer.

882
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:26,200
So now that I've corrected for the pixels to M and I'm looking at on

883
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:33,200
projecting that Mouse P there after I do the unprojected, and then I

884
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,200
Center it around this particular Collision volume.

885
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,300
Ah, and there's yet another problem.

886
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,800
So when I am doing the, the offset p .x y, right?

887
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,400
And the offset P .z these are

888
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,500
Not actually where the thing is, right?

889
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:57,100
It's it's actually going to be relative to The Entity itself as well,

890
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,000
right?

891
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,300
So first we would have to put the mouse relative to The Entity.

892
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,700
Before going any further.

893
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,700
So this, right.

894
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,300
And we can do this first, right?

895
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,700
We can do something like this where we've got you know like M Mouse

896
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,200
pee.

897
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,500
Right, when we've got Mouse in meters, we then want to do is make it

898
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,500
relative to The Entity here.

899
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,000
So M Mouse pee.

900
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,100
We want all the rest of this stuff to happen, relative to The Entity.

901
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,000
So when we do this on Project, this local Z is actually not the

902
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,200
correct local Z, right.

903
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:42,100
It's because this m Mouse P that local Z needs to actually include

904
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,700
whatever the entities P was as well and of course on Project since it

905
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,600
uses the transform, which has been set for this entity that will

906
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,200
actually work because it gets included.

907
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,400
It in there, right?

908
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,600
But this subtract, which is not going through there.

909
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Won't and it's a little bit subtle but just so I'll just reinforce it.

910
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,500
One project uses the transform and the transform here was already set

911
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,000
up to be relative to The Entity.

912
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,000
So anything that we draw or call the render system for is already

913
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,100
entity relative, right?

914
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,200
But this piece of math is not in any relative.

915
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,100
This is using the volumes offset P but it what it really should be

916
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,200
doing is being using the enemies P, right?

917
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,500
It needs to take into account this thing right here.

918
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
This entity any ground point.

919
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,900
It needs to know that, right?

920
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,300
Because that's what's actually

921
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,100
Used.

922
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,000
So it needs the volumes be and it also needs it also needs the

923
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,500
entities transforms.

924
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,600
Well, so it needs both of those things to take into account both of

925
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,700
those things, right?

926
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,200
Then it will actually local look relative to it and I think, actually

927
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,200
that might have been most of the bug entirely possible.

928
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:02,600
Anyway,

929
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,400
Getting a little closer.

930
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,800
So those are still those are now much too conservative.

931
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,300
So it's see here.

932
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,800
We've got our M Mouse P, which was converted from meters to pixels,

933
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,300
which is what we wanted because that would be multiplying by pixels to

934
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,800
M which is exactly what we want to do.

935
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,600
We unprotect it which is what we want, using the Z that's relative.

936
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,000
Mmm.

937
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,300
that all looks fine to me, we then subtract

938
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:55,300
Whatever the transforms offset was plus the volumes offset and we go

939
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,600
ahead and draw that on there.

940
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:04,900
That seems pretty reasonable to me I guess.

941
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,200
since it is a perspective projection though, technically we're not

942
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,800
really doing this in the correct order there because then

943
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
After we do that back projection.

944
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,900
Well, now that's should actually I think that should actually be okay.

945
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,700
That's still, that seems like it should actually be correct.

946
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,200
But anyway, you can see why I am already thinking it's not correct

947
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,900
though, right?

948
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,900
Is because as I'm moving these, all these things were drawing our

949
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,300
where the thinks the mouse is relative to some entity.

950
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,700
And so what we should be seeing, right is we should always be seeing

951
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,000
those guys line up with the mouse cursor, right?

952
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,900
They should always be lined up with the mouse cursor.

953
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,400
Sir and if they're not then it's just erroneous, right?

954
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,800
so,

955
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,900
You know, the other thing I can do is I could do something like this

956
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:06,400
as well.

957
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,800
This right here since I have an entity index, I could just pick one

958
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,200
entity, right?

959
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:20,500
Like so.

960
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,500
Not sure.

961
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,700
Which one do we want?

962
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,600
But we'll figure that out in a second here.

963
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:33,000
So, if I run this will pick an entity, maybe get one of them trees.

964
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,100
Do you see it?

965
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,700
There it is.

966
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,600
So now we're drawing.

967
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,300
Where we think the mouse is relative to this guy and you can just see

968
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,000
that that's like totally like that.

969
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This is very nonsensical, right?

970
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,200
It's not at all in the correct place.

971
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,800
Now, it's not even the correct scale so like I said we've got kind of

972
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,800
a couple things that are there still something a little bit amiss, if

973
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,200
you will about how this is happening.

974
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,200
But like I said, I kind of want to do.

975
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,000
This is a fairly standard debugging thing, right?

976
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,900
I kind of wanted to reduce the number of cases, I'm looking at here,

977
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,500
just so I can get a little bit better idea what's going on.

978
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,400
So just by dropping it down to a single entity.

979
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,900
I don't have to sort of think about everything at once that's being

980
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,700
drawn on the screen.

981
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,600
So here we are.

982
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,600
We've got M Mouse p and after I unprojected that I'm kind of

983
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,200
interested to know after unprojected, right?

984
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,800
I'm kind of interested to know if I just on Project.

985
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
It what does it look like?

986
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,500
Then if I don't do the subtract I kind of want to know.

987
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,200
I'm just for educational purposes.

988
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,500
I want to see what it looks like.

989
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,600
If I don't correct it.

990
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,200
Right.

991
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:59,400
And so there you can kind of see not correcting, it surprisingly makes

992
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,900
it in there in the right place and I'm wondering does unprojected,

993
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,800
take into account this.

994
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,700
It doesn't see em project never takes into account where things are.

995
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,500
So, I'm a little weirded out of why I don't have to do this subtract.

996
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,300
This subtract should have to happen.

997
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,400
Very peculiar.

998
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,700
Very, very peculiar.

999
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,200
I guess that makes some sense though because if you think about it,

1000
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,800
it's always gonna draw a relative to The Entity because that's what

1001
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,000
it's programmed to do, right?

1002
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,700
It's using that as its transform, so that's not that surprising.

1003
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,500
And so anything that you moved around the center of the screen, you

1004
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,500
know, it was but but even so

1005
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,200
Okay.

1006
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:57,900
Now so there it is.

1007
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,300
So is around the center of screen, okay.

1008
00:53:59,300 --> 00:53:59,900
So that's totally

1009
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,800
I'm just watching its motion, right?

1010
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,100
So if I Circle it like this I should see it kind of move you know,

1011
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,700
relative to the square towards the mouse cursor and I'm not seeing

1012
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,100
that.

1013
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,200
So that's what I want to be able to do right.

1014
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,700
Yeah, that seems a little bit more like it.

1015
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,000
I was going to say,

1016
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,700
You should have to do that.

1017
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,700
So when I do this on project and I take it back to the with the local

1018
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,900
Z like that, I feel like that distance from camera so I feel like if I

1019
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,800
look at what's going on here I feel like maybe our unprojected just

1020
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,900
kind of fundamentally busted because if you look at what it's doing

1021
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,400
it's never taking into account the actual offset P, it's as if the

1022
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,900
offset P doesn't exist, right?

1023
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
So really,

1024
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,700
This local Z really should actually contain the entirety of this

1025
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,300
transform, right?

1026
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,500
It should actually have this in it, which is kind of dumb.

1027
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,400
I feel like that's not so good.

1028
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,000
The way that works because you feel like unproductive on Project

1029
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,900
should probably take that into account.

1030
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,900
But anyway, so that's probably more correct.

1031
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,900
I think when we do that it should have that transform that offset p z

1032
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,000
in there and then you know, both of those have that the locals.

1033
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,600
He has that right?

1034
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,800
So I'm pretty sure that's, that's more correct.

1035
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,500
So the a distance from camera again,

1036
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,700
Yeah, I just I mean that seems pretty clear to me.

1037
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,300
So the at distance from camera

1038
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,500
should include the full Z of the object, whatever that is.

1039
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,600
And then the

1040
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,800
I'm pretty certain that should give us the correct scaling.

1041
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,300
And so I'm not sure the thing that that's kind of weird is why it's

1042
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,800
not giving us the correct scaling I guess.

1043
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:02,300
So after we do this this, unprojected local Z, that's the tricky part,

1044
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,700
is this push wrecked will actually use that.

1045
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,000
So it's actually only the volume Z.

1046
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,000
This is just nasty that you would use their.

1047
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,100
This is why I think our unprojected needs to be more symmetric

1048
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,500
Just it's simply a little too crazy at that point.

1049
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,500
Yeah, but that's still not scaled properly and I'm not sure why,

1050
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:23,700
right?

1051
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,300
Because I feel like it should be scaled, it should be moving with the

1052
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,200
mouse properly.

1053
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,100
So unless I'm doing something wrong with the m Mouse P here, where I'm

1054
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:38,700
doing something incorrect where I'm not properly preparing it with m 2

1055
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:43,000
pixels and I can double-check like we're just trying to do the inverse

1056
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,100
remember of our

1057
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,700
Get entity basis p.

1058
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,200
That makes sense.

1059
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Render is the speed was good, but the function called there it is.

1060
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:05,000
So yeah, you can kind of see what's basically going on here, right?

1061
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,800
So we're just trying to undo this.

1062
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,300
So we multiply m 2 pixels times.

1063
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,000
The projected X Y to get the location of it.

1064
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,500
We can ignore these probably this result scoffs Lizzie that's like the

1065
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,100
Y offset for Z, but you can see here, we've got sort of the screen

1066
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,700
Center.

1067
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,600
And then we've got that projected, why?

1068
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,700
Now that should be it, right?

1069
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,600
I mean, that should be pretty much the whole thing.

1070
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:39,500
You can see this projected X Y, distance 2pz thing that

1071
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,800
This is the p.

1072
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,400
Z is just the distance above Target.

1073
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,800
So yeah, that that all seems.

1074
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,700
Really reasonable.

1075
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,900
That all seems pretty reasonable to me.

1076
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,700
So you can see here, write the transfer m 2 pixels, the projected XYZ

1077
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,800
there, right?

1078
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,600
Whatever the Z is that Z value is what the scale would be.

1079
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,900
That's how much the mouse should be moving.

1080
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,800
So again, I feel like 1 over m, 2 pixels should have done it and I'm

1081
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,800
not sure why.

1082
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,700
It doesn't?

1083
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,400
I feel like we're probably going to run out of time here.

1084
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,600
I don't know when I started was probably like six ten.

1085
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,200
I feel like this requires a little more careful consideration.

1086
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,600
So I feel like like I said, I feel like we want this function to be

1087
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:37,800
more.

1088
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,700
Symmetric, I feel like we want it.

1089
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:45,400
Exactly undo, this transform and we're not quite doing that at the

1090
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,000
moment, right?

1091
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,200
Because if you were to take a look at what this is doing,

1092
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,100
if you just look at just this

1093
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,000
Like so.

1094
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,800
We're talking about this equation.

1095
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,000
And so if we got transformed m, 2 pixels, projected XY, like so we

1096
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:19,000
want to undo this operation and this is right.

1097
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,300
That.

1098
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,200
So if what we want to do is we want to get raw XY out of here, that's

1099
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,200
what we're trying to do.

1100
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,000
We you know, because we want to do the inverse, we've got this, you

1101
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,700
know, we've got projected, we've got we've got result.

1102
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,800
Bright and we want to get this solving this equation, right is going

1103
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,500
to do, you're going to divide by this to get that out of there, right?

1104
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,400
Oops, that was not a very good cut and paste.

1105
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,200
All right, so get that out of there.

1106
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,200
And then you just left with this.

1107
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:11,300
Yeah, and then I just actually just get rid of these two guys.

1108
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,100
and then,

1109
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,100
We want to solve for rho, x y.

1110
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:22,600
So we would move this guy over, right?

1111
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,800
So, we'd also be dividing by this.

1112
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,200
Which I think means this guy to the top, right?

1113
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:35,400
Yeah.

1114
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,600
And then the focal length again also oops.

1115
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:40,800
Yeah.

1116
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,900
Focal length is also going to get divided out so it's something like

1117
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,300
that.

1118
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,800
So, it's just itchin to pz X result over the focal length.

1119
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,200
And I'm pretty sure that's basically exactly what we had.

1120
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,400
The only difference is we left out the m 2 pixels, right?

1121
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,400
So there's that distance to pz.

1122
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,500
Right.

1123
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah, so there's that.

1124
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,100
Distance 2pz on the top.

1125
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,400
There's the focal length on the bottom.

1126
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,100
There's a result so that that is exactly what we do.

1127
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:28,200
The only difference is we left out m 2 pixels.

1128
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,500
So in theory, it just feels like if you get that back and you divide

1129
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,400
by m 2 pixels that should have done the inverse.

1130
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,700
So there's obviously something I said stupid that I'm just not picking

1131
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,800
up on because that does look like the inverse and although I don't

1132
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,900
like the symmetry of it, I'd rather just a bug this as it stands.

1133
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,000
Before making that modification.

1134
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:54,200
But you know, again dividing, that m 2 pixels, I guess.

1135
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:00,100
The thing is you do the divided by m 2 pixels, kind of, at the end of

1136
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,700
that, it shouldn't matter when you do it because it's linear.

1137
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,300
So I don't feel like that should matter at all.

1138
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,200
So that should be the the right thing I think.

1139
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,300
But obviously, it's not because if it was this would be working.

1140
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,700
And it is not working and so yeah.

1141
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
We'll have to test it more thoroughly tomorrow, I guess.

1142
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,500
Very strange.

1143
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,300
Don't really want to stop debugging this.

1144
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:47,200
I want to kind of go actually finish it because I feel like I never

1145
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,300
like not knowing why something is doing what it's doing.

1146
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,900
And these kinds of this kind of code is always very finicky because

1147
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,100
you can't see it very effectively while the reasons I kind of want

1148
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,000
debug diagramming in our system as well.

1149
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,200
But yeah, it's just one of those things where it's like, there's

1150
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,500
something simple going on here.

1151
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:09,900
That's not clear about what exactly is not being reversible.

1152
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,400
And I don't like leaving something like that, because it ends up

1153
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,000
bugging me.

1154
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But I can't think of anything in the shorthand, so I feel like I'm

1155
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,500
just going to have to because otherwise, yeah, I mean, we could we

1156
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,600
could be here for another hour of me looking at it and going through

1157
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,000
each individual part and verifying it and so on.

1158
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,000
So it's probably deserve something better done for tomorrow.

1159
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,300
So let me see.

1160
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:41,700
So let's think here offset, p- the dim Z

1161
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,600
Volume Jim, XY, outline color.

1162
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,900
So that's just kind of that all assumes the centering around so that

1163
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,000
that all looks like again look exactly like what I would expect.

1164
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,000
The M.

1165
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,200
Mouse P looks exactly what I would expect, right?

1166
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,700
Divides by the m, 2 pixels for the transform.

1167
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,700
Which seems totally reasonable.

1168
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,300
And

1169
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,600
The local Z.

1170
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,700
I guess, one thing I don't know is if distance from camera is supposed

1171
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,200
to be positive or negative there.

1172
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,300
But that wouldn't expect affect the scale, it would only affect the

1173
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,700
direction of movement, it would be flipped, right?

1174
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,300
And if I unprojected Intergroup that I'm on now, I passed the M Mouse

1175
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,600
p and the locals.

1176
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,300
Eat that should give me a point in the world.

1177
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:48,100
That is where that mouse was

1178
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,400
Relatively speaking.

1179
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,200
Yeah, I don't know.

1180
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,200
There's something scale.

1181
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,500
Scale wrong.

1182
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,300
Scaling wise about what we're doing.

1183
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,600
But I don't know what it is.

1184
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,200
Are we sure we don't know?

1185
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:31,700
on what order is the actual

1186
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,100
lack of scale.

1187
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,500
Like how far away from being correct?

1188
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,100
Is that like for starters?

1189
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,700
It's it's not centered around the correct thing, right?

1190
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,400
But the scale itself being wrong is kind of interesting.

1191
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,300
So let me try something here.

1192
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,900
I'm just going to try something a little bit a little bit crazy,

1193
01:05:59,200 --> 01:05:59,700
right?

1194
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,100
So in here, when we're always offsetting around the ground and the

1195
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,700
point like we were doing before, right?

1196
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,800
I'm going to I'm going to just see what happens.

1197
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,500
If instead of doing that we were to just go ahead and like

1198
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,600
You know like say okay the Rena group transform offset p is going to

1199
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,000
be set back to zero.

1200
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,300
So now all of the drawing is going to happen relative to just the

1201
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,100
regular old world.

1202
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,700
And so when I do this stuff here,

1203
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,800
In fact, what I could do is I can draw the mouse, I could even stop

1204
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,500
doing this.

1205
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,200
I could just a bug that Mouse transformed by itself, right?

1206
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,500
I could just say, oh okay, I'm going to do exactly what I was doing

1207
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,100
before where I take a look on Mouse.

1208
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,600
Be I do and I'm project.

1209
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,800
But I'm just going to make up a z-value, whatever it is.

1210
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,000
It's 10 meters away from the mouse.

1211
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,600
Let's say so at 10 meters away from the mouse and again we can also do

1212
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,800
this the same

1213
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:07,600
Right?

1214
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,300
So we clear off that transform.

1215
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,300
We say 10 meters away from the mouse.

1216
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:15,000
Where would it be?

1217
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,400
And then we just draw that we draw that world must be at 10 meters off

1218
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,600
out and that should again if we reproject it using the same local Z,

1219
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,000
we should

1220
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,200
We should see it right on top of our cursor and we're assuming that

1221
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,300
our transformed function is broken.

1222
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,400
So we won't see it.

1223
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:37,800
Yeah.

1224
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,600
And we don't

1225
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:44,200
right, I'm going to set the debug camera out a little bit just to see

1226
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,600
Where that draws.

1227
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:57,700
Sam.

1228
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:58,600
Even see that at all.

1229
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
How's that possible?

1230
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,800
Why am I not seeing anything?

1231
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,900
But that makes it pretty easy.

1232
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,300
We can just step in and see what's going on here.

1233
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,200
Right.

1234
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,400
I guess we should also set the scale to one just to be sure.

1235
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,200
But, I mean that should not affect it, right?

1236
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,500
All right, so let's see what's going on here we do m 2 pixels.

1237
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,899
We do the unprojected with 10 meters as the distance.

1238
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,000
I suppose.

1239
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:42,100
I don't see anything for their so it's not some weird thing about it

1240
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,100
being behind the camera.

1241
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,500
So let's figure out why this is not working.

1242
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,399
Well.

1243
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:54,300
That would probably do do it a little bit.

1244
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,300
Okay, so there we go.

1245
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
so, looking at that,

1246
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:11,000
You can kind of see that, it's okay, but not great, it's not really

1247
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
tracking the mouse.

1248
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:16,399
It's sort of where the mouse is but not really so something's wrong

1249
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,000
with that.

1250
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,100
And let's see what happens if I change the local z21.

1251
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,300
Yeah, so it's really just totally wrong because what should be

1252
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,200
happening when we do that on Project, is it should be scale-invariant.

1253
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:32,300
No matter what, local Z, whatever Z we pass here, as long as we pass

1254
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,399
the same Z here, the unprojected and the reproject should put it back

1255
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,300
in the same place.

1256
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,899
And the fact that that's not happening means it's obviously wrong,

1257
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,800
like, that's just, that's just flat-out bad, right?

1258
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,500
So that local Z

1259
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,300
That local Z no matter what.

1260
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,800
We said it to, we should get the same results and we're not.

1261
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:02,100
So let's look at it, one more time and see what what am I doing wrong

1262
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:02,500
there?

1263
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:06,600
That's causing that problem, because that is definitely not correct,

1264
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,500
right?

1265
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,800
So we've got transform distance above Target.

1266
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,700
And then we're saying the distance to pz is a distance above Target -

1267
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,200
whatever the Z value is.

1268
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,600
So, that alone.

1269
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,800
That alone could be our problem.

1270
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,900
We are not accounting for that at, all right?

1271
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,200
So the distance from camera in that unprojected

1272
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,800
Is not really.

1273
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,600
That was a little too purpose-built that looks like almost the

1274
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,900
entirety of the problem to me.

1275
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:50,600
Yeah.

1276
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,000
That's the problem.

1277
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,600
So when we're passing this Z, right that Z value.

1278
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:00,500
Yeah.

1279
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:00,800
Okay.

1280
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:06,700
So this Z value actually first, and you can see that there is that

1281
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:12,300
there we had, it just render entity basis P.

1282
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,600
The fact that Z actually looks like that distance above Target,

1283
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,800
- pz that is actually probably our problem, right?

1284
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,400
It's happening here but it's not going to happen in on project.

1285
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,700
So really what we would need to do is after we unprojected this thing,

1286
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:38,000
we would need to take that value.

1287
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,700
That we get back.

1288
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,800
Right?

1289
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,500
And we need to local Z instead of being 1.0.

1290
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:52,000
When we actually pass this in, it would actually, you know, the local

1291
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,600
see that we're talking about would actually have to be like the

1292
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
reverse of that.

1293
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,000
So it would have to be, it would have to take transform distance above

1294
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,600
targets.

1295
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:02,800
Right?

1296
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:09,800
And it would have to like have it be, you know, would it have to put

1297
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:10,800
that in there?

1298
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:17,200
Like, like this, if I'm not mistaken, right?

1299
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,400
It would need to be, it would need to have this be subtracted out.

1300
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,300
Oh, and I guess more like that because it's going to automatically

1301
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:24,800
subtract out.

1302
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,900
This is from Target and just be left with Peezy.

1303
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,700
I think that's correct.

1304
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:30,200
But yeah.

1305
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,900
That's just something we're going to have to.

1306
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,800
We're going to have to re-architect the way that works a little bit

1307
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,300
because that's just complete garbage.

1308
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,800
We want are two things to be symmetric there, right?

1309
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,500
And so I'm not even sure exactly.

1310
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:48,100
We have to get it to undo so that once it is pushed through here it's

1311
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:52,500
going to equal the total distance to be that local Z is so basically

1312
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:57,700
we have to make this equation come out to be local Z right?

1313
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,000
So

1314
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:03,300
We need to make, you know, whatever Foo is.

1315
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:13,200
Like this we need to make sure that distance above Target.

1316
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,500
This this whole thing comes out to be local Z is what we actually

1317
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,600
need, right?

1318
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,800
So food should be equal to local z+.

1319
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,100
Nope, I take it back.

1320
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,400
It's a - distance above Target.

1321
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,100
Right?

1322
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,600
And so then you that's the - Foo.

1323
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,300
So the positive food would be just as about Target - local Z.

1324
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,100
so, this is actually

1325
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,400
I guess what?

1326
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,400
The thing would be to correctly.

1327
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,500
Reverse that transform.

1328
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,500
If I'm not mistaken.

1329
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,300
I think.

1330
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,100
but actually, compile

1331
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:51,800
Yes.

1332
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,000
Okay, so I think that should have done it, although it doesn't look

1333
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,100
again, still, not quite right.

1334
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:05,100
But that's definitely like that's that's definitely a big part of our

1335
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,200
issue there in the sense that there's no.

1336
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:15,200
Yeah.

1337
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,000
So I think what we really want to do is just actually reverse this

1338
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,800
transform properly, and of course, we do have a slight problem where

1339
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,100
we're going to have to think about what that means for.

1340
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,800
Actually, the way we were using on project before, but basically I

1341
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,500
want to take this whole thing, right?

1342
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,300
And make this a little bit more specific, right?

1343
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,500
So if we were to do a complete unprojected, so let's say, I went down

1344
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,000
here and we've got a eject as it currently stands.

1345
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,100
If we were to do

1346
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,100
a complete unprojected, we need to do one.

1347
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,600
That actually takes into account all of these things, right?

1348
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,600
so, the first thing would be

1349
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,200
We would probably want to do this, if Transformer, if the graphic

1350
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,700
thing honestly, right, we'd probably want to do these so that we can

1351
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,500
do both branches, right?

1352
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,400
We don't want to use the debug camera ever, because we probably want

1353
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,900
that to keep it sort of its thing going on.

1354
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,900
I will though, we could actually, we could, maybe, I don't know, I

1355
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,400
don't know, which depends on which kind of, unprojected, we wanted to

1356
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:31,800
be doing.

1357
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,600
But so anyway, so what we would want

1358
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:40,200
Do curious a alright, the distance of p z greater than your clip

1359
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,000
playing test.

1360
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,200
We'll start inside there.

1361
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,800
Here's the result P.

1362
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,100
We don't care about the scale because that doesn't actually happen.

1363
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,100
So, this right here is our final pee.

1364
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,700
And this is what we did to it, right?

1365
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:01,500
So I'm going to undo, ignore this one part of it, because I feel like

1366
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,300
this part, we haven't settled on yet.

1367
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,200
So I'm going to leave that out for now.

1368
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,900
And then we're going to just do this part of it.

1369
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,800
So again, what we're trying to solve for here, we're going to try and

1370
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,800
solve for what the

1371
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,900
What this input p is this guy right here, right?

1372
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:25,900
So I'm just going to kind try and do these things roughly backwards,

1373
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:26,700
right?

1374
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,600
So if I want to do these things roughly backwards, then what I would

1375
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,800
need to do is say, okay, if we start out with this

1376
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:38,600
And what I'm getting passed in, is this final P?

1377
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,000
Then, in order to do this step, I would want to get this projected, XY

1378
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:44,800
back.

1379
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,700
So, the first thing I would do is subtract the screen center like that

1380
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,600
and then what the next thing I would do after that.

1381
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,600
if I divide by m 2 pixels,

1382
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,100
And then I would have my projected x y.

1383
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:02,200
Right?

1384
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:05,800
So that's my projected X.

1385
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,300
Y is y XY.

1386
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:14,400
Then I guess what I would do is say, Okay offset Z.

1387
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,500
That's not actually thing that we're using anymore.

1388
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,200
Like I said, we kind of got rid of that.

1389
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,200
We've got the distance above Target, that stays exactly as it was.

1390
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,000
We've got the distance to 2pz.

1391
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,100
The p .z is what we're actually solving for, right?

1392
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:29,900
In this case,

1393
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,000
And so we need to do that for our next step, which is this thing.

1394
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:53,500
So in order to back cell for this, we have the projected xyy here and

1395
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:57,000
we need to force them back through this thing, right?

1396
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,700
So this is like, sort of the next

1397
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,100
The next step of it.

1398
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:02,300
This is like the

1399
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:09,800
I guess what we should call, this is like decentered, it's like the

1400
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,700
decentered or scaled, I don't know and it will call this will just

1401
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:17,700
call this a DOT XY, right?

1402
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,700
And then here, when we get back to get back, projected, x y and write.

1403
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:29,100
That was something where we had this this raw XY, that was getting

1404
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,800
passed in here, which was the original key, right?

1405
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,900
We want to solve for that row.

1406
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:34,800
X Y.

1407
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,000
So what we want to do is again, we want to move this stuff over.

1408
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,100
So we've got our projected XY here, right?

1409
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,100
Which is going to be that that ax?

1410
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,000
Why we want to take this 1 over distance 2pz.

1411
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,000
We want to move that to the other side.

1412
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,200
So we want to divide by that, right?

1413
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,000
And dividing by a divided is going to be multiplied.

1414
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,300
And then we've got the focal length here.

1415
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,700
That's going to be a divide

1416
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,900
so there's that familiar part again, but we already had and then

1417
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,000
here's the raw x y

1418
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,100
Let me get past in, right?

1419
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,800
so basically,

1420
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,600
Don't need to know the near clipping plane.

1421
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:24,700
We do need to know this.

1422
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,600
Solving for the X Y there.

1423
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,600
Yeah.

1424
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,200
That just gives us the pxy that we actually wanted.

1425
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,700
So this is our results, x y.

1426
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,900
Again, that's exactly what we had before.

1427
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,100
But the tricky part here, is this distance to pz.

1428
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,100
So, our distance to pz.

1429
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,300
And I suppose, this part here, the final P.

1430
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,400
This is our, this is our input value, right?

1431
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,600
The distance to pz in that equation is distance of a park.

1432
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,500
It - peasy, right?

1433
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,500
So, this thing gets inserted in here and we know that p z, that's a

1434
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,200
given wheeler transferred Target, that's given.

1435
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:32,700
So this is actually entirety of it and I feel like that should do it

1436
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,400
right.

1437
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:36,100
Like that.

1438
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:40,400
Feels like it should be the long and short of it.

1439
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:53,100
At the end of it, after all that.

1440
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,800
I feel like all we have to do is inverse that sort of offset people.

1441
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,400
Part of it as well.

1442
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,300
So, whatever the result is,

1443
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,100
That would actually get transformed by the offset p.

1444
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,700
and I feel like that that should have been it, but if I take a look at

1445
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,000
what that actually does,

1446
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,600
You know, the actual things that that does, are the things that we

1447
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,700
already were doing.

1448
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:29,000
Right, we divided by m 2 pixels as a tech you know in our test code.

1449
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:31,800
Right.

1450
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:39,400
We set the thing that we were passing in to be the distance above

1451
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,500
Target - the local PC.

1452
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,700
And we have the offset and scale set to 0 and 1.

1453
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,900
So they're not in play.

1454
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,100
So, I do not understand why that.

1455
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:00,400
Right there did not successfully lineup.

1456
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:02,000
Right.

1457
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,700
Like why does that not successfully do sort of a symmetric lie?

1458
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,400
Reversed operation, you know I'm saying?

1459
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,100
Because I've kind of verified the logic to my satisfaction now.

1460
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,900
And so I think that like again like I said there's something much more

1461
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,600
complicated that we're just not accounting for.

1462
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,100
All right.

1463
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,800
Well, I think based on that.

1464
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:36,300
I would say.

1465
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,200
I saw some residual peanut butter here, leftover from the free stream.

1466
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,000
I would say that I'm not pleased with how janky that stuff is in there

1467
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,200
and I feel like I don't want to be in a situation where I'm going to

1468
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,200
have to constantly be like, looking through that stuff.

1469
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,000
So I feel like we would definitely want to go ahead and spend some

1470
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,400
time, cleaning up, what's happening in that projection and just do

1471
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,300
some tests where we can figure out like okay we can all we have some

1472
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,600
like well defined spaces, here's like screen space.

1473
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,400
Here's you know World space and the transfer between them should work.

1474
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,000
Like no.

1475
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,000
Vast like that shouldn't be a thing that we have to think about

1476
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,400
anymore.

1477
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,600
We should be able to debug that once and have it good and it seemed

1478
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,400
like we sort of had something like that for doing the camera bounds.

1479
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,700
And, and I guess for some reason,

1480
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:32,600
Whatever that reason is, it's something is, is amiss with how we're

1481
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:37,500
doing that calculation, and it doesn't line up with the forward

1482
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,100
transform, that makes sense.

1483
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,000
So I'm not sure again, what that is?

1484
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,500
It's going to bug me, but we'll have to do that tomorrow.

1485
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,800
If that makes sense.

1486
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,100
So let's see.

1487
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,400
We will do a little Q&A anyways, even though we're sort of out of

1488
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,800
time, that's not really a big deal.

1489
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,600
So we can see if anyone had questions on that, maybe people already

1490
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,600
figured it out, but I don't know if they did or didn't.

1491
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,700
And, yeah, there's always is, it does always seem like there's a lot

1492
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:28,200
of lag between when, when, when I see things.

1493
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,600
and and when people on the track and hear them,

1494
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:48,900
Cam locks, how will the focal length factor in will you have fov

1495
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,400
stuff?

1496
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,600
Well, we already do.

1497
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:56,900
So, you know, we did basically like when you do this sort of thing,

1498
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:02,400
when you go kind of up up and down the focal length determines like

1499
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,400
sort of how that transform happens, right?

1500
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,500
Because the focal length of the camera, determines what the Z, what

1501
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,800
the foreshortening actually is like

1502
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,300
Rapidly that happens.

1503
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,400
so,

1504
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,600
So yeah.

1505
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,500
I feel like that's just it's so annoying.

1506
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,100
I hate having a bug.

1507
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:42,400
I don't know so I don't like leaving it but something pretty basic

1508
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,300
pretty simple like it's going to be very simple in just the way that

1509
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,100
we're thinking this through is incorrect.

1510
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,100
And so, yeah.

1511
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:09,300
I do feel like if in sohbat had really gotten its deep learning on, it

1512
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:14,300
would just have known the answer, it would be like oh hey guys the bug

1513
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:15,100
is blah.

1514
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,200
So my related, what do you think about using different types for

1515
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,600
points and vectors?

1516
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:28,100
I don't find it to be very useful.

1517
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:34,500
I find it to actually be kind of more of a pain because fundamentally

1518
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,600
speaking Point versus Vector is not about storage.

1519
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,900
It's about usage.

1520
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,400
It's about like conceptualization.

1521
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,800
And there are plenty of times when you may want to conceptualize

1522
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:46,300
something as two different things depending on the circumstance.

1523
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:48,700
And now you're in this thing, we got to like cast or convert and it's

1524
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:49,600
just annoying, you know?

1525
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,000
Does the screen center need to be involved?

1526
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,500
It was using complete a projected.

1527
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:58,900
So as far as I know, the mouse is already centered around.

1528
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,900
That's why I check that before.

1529
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,400
Worse, the mouse already is centered around the center of the screen

1530
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,300
so that part didn't really need to happen.

1531
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,800
Sorry pancakes is part of the problem that the code isn't normalizing.

1532
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,000
The motion between the mass and the entity relative to the screen

1533
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,100
dimensions in World coordinates at different levels.

1534
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,900
So this transform in on Project.

1535
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,300
Is completely linear.

1536
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:47,900
Right?

1537
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,000
It's just a series of multiplies.

1538
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:56,700
So it should not matter when we transform the mouse from pixels to

1539
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:01,000
meters, we should be able to do it before or after the on project and

1540
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,200
there should be no change.

1541
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,300
Right?

1542
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,400
And I guess you know, since we're in bug land we might as well verify

1543
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,200
this fact.

1544
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,500
I mean that's what it looks like now.

1545
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,200
And if I was to change it to doing it after the fact, right?

1546
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:19,000
Where we did a transform first and then did the m 2 pixels, I should

1547
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,400
get the exact same result.

1548
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:22,000
Right?

1549
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,700
And I do so.

1550
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:29,900
Hey math still works, so that's something, but yeah, for whatever

1551
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,600
reason.

1552
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:37,400
We still have a problem in terms of how we're doing that.

1553
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,700
Now, one thing I should look for that, we didn't look for as well,

1554
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:41,300
right?

1555
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,800
Is in push wrecked.

1556
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,200
We do get render into basis P.

1557
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,800
I'm assuming we use it directly.

1558
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:50,000
Yeah, we do.

1559
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,300
So we do use it directly.

1560
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:58,300
And then when I actually render it render to rectangle, draw a

1561
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,600
rectangle PP entry dim.

1562
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,100
So it actually gets used very well.

1563
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,300
Make sure there wasn't any other transforms happening in there.

1564
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,800
America Embraces we have run out of questions.

1565
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,000
Well, I haven't run out of questions because I still have a question,

1566
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,500
which is what is the problem with this unprojected?

1567
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,200
Right?

1568
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,600
And that's a pretty good question.

1569
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:49,900
I feel like

1570
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,200
I feel like that's the kind of question I would like to have somebody

1571
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:57,700
answer.

1572
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,400
And I don't really know.

1573
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,500
I don't really know what the problem is.

1574
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,100
because that

1575
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:32,400
this the dis is my project - pz, so that's just going to end up being

1576
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,800
Local Z, right?

1577
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,600
And so it's going to use one over local Z times the focal length.

1578
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,900
X whatever we pump through what we're asking it to do.

1579
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:45,800
Right.

1580
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,300
And so,

1581
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:02,700
yeah.

1582
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,500
No, the questions.

1583
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:24,500
yes, it the problem is

1584
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,600
I think we should probably pick it up tomorrow because it's unbounded,

1585
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:28,800
right?

1586
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,800
It's like nobody has any idea what the bug actually is.

1587
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,900
So we have to kind of go through and and step through it and be kind

1588
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:42,400
of relatively meticulous about what we're doing so we can see what the

1589
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,300
situation is.

1590
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:51,000
So, you know, I don't really know.

1591
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,800
Unfortunately, I don't really know any any simpler way to deal with it

1592
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,500
than that?

1593
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,700
if we just do that quickly,

1594
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,500
let's see here.

1595
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,100
if I just do that quickly,

1596
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:22,400
and, you know,

1597
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,300
I should sort of make a meta Point here because I feel like it's

1598
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:31,400
probably warranted.

1599
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:41,900
So this is the kind of bug that costs you time typically right.

1600
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,500
We've kind of talked about some sort of programming

1601
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,100
like I don't know attitude or whatever like the you know the

1602
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,300
programming sort of like the Viewpoint of programming on handmade hero

1603
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,200
and you know this is this is kind of a disconnect.

1604
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,800
The fundamental disconnect I tend to

1605
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,700
Of with most software engineering stuff.

1606
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:09,600
It's like when you talk about languages or tools for programming, this

1607
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,000
is what cost me time.

1608
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:16,400
A lot of times in terms of bugs, I don't tend to have a lot of bugs

1609
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,300
that are about me, forgetting to free some memory or something, right?

1610
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,100
So like when people say oh we made this language and it's garbage

1611
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,300
collected, it's great or whatever, right?

1612
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,800
It's like okay, you know, maybe that's save some time occasionally,

1613
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
IE, it would probably save some time on handmade hero because I'm

1614
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,800
programming with no libraries at all.

1615
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,800
So I don't even have my own stuff that does like allocation anything.

1616
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,100
So I have to write, you know, a linked list or whatever on him, a

1617
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:41,700
hero.

1618
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,500
But in practice like, who cares that stuff?

1619
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,300
I write it like once and it's fine, right?

1620
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,300
But stuff like this because typically, you know, you write a lot of

1621
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,100
code like this.

1622
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:55,900
And even if you were using something like let's say, you, you know,

1623
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:58,600
you didn't have to worry about unprojected in particular because you

1624
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,900
use somebody else's 3D engine or whatever.

1625
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:04,500
So, you know, you've you can maybe take care of that with a library or

1626
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,700
however you we're doing it in your programming methodology.

1627
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:08,600
You didn't work with that.

1628
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,400
You still have the problem of you're going to write stuff like this in

1629
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,200
game code like you've got some things and you're trying to you know,

1630
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,600
compute something between them and it's just it comes out wrong.

1631
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,100
And you're like, what

1632
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,000
Ben Wright.

1633
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:25,000
The kind of stuff that I want in programming to make life easier is

1634
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,300
stuff.

1635
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,500
That makes the bugging things like this easier.

1636
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:30,700
Like I don't need something that makes debugging memory stuff easier

1637
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:32,300
because that doesn't ever happen.

1638
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,500
Like, that's like such a rare occurrence.

1639
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,100
Something this happens to me all the time and so like you could

1640
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,500
imagine like if a visual studio could just be like, draw this out,

1641
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:44,400
like draw, these vectors like show them to me, right?

1642
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,600
So I can see them and I can see the steps of the equation and how it's

1643
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,000
going, it would probably be.

1644
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:54,200
We'd probably all instantly know what the problem was.

1645
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,500
But now instead when I got to step through this, we're just looking at

1646
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,600
a bag of numbers that we can't even tell what they are or what they're

1647
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,800
doing or why, right?

1648
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,400
And so that's really the thing that's kind of frustrating is people

1649
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,200
always seem to be.

1650
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,200
They seem to work on these development tools.

1651
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:17,300
That actually are four problems that I just don't have or problems

1652
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:20,300
that I can solve in a very short amount of time with, not very much

1653
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,700
effort and very low stress.

1654
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,700
Right.

1655
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,600
But then problems like this that are actually hard get completely

1656
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,000
neglected and you typically have no tools for them at all.

1657
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,200
And so the only thing that you can possibly hope for is if someone

1658
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:36,400
already wrote the code for something like this that you could then use

1659
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,400
but assuming that you are trying to develop the code yourself, which

1660
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,700
is what you do if you're a programmer.

1661
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,100
So no matter what Libras unit, you're going to write something

1662
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:48,000
yourself, whatever that something is, will have bugs like this, and

1663
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,100
they're hard to find, right?

1664
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:55,100
And so that's really the thing where it's like you want this, you

1665
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,700
know, you want things that make this sort of stuff.

1666
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,100
You know, trivial like that you wouldn't really think you wouldn't,

1667
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,500
you know, just like, oh yeah, I immediately could see what the bug was

1668
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,200
and we were done, right.

1669
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:12,700
So yeah.

1670
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:16,100
But anyway, if we just take a quick look at this, here's our Mass P.

1671
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,100
You know, that's what it is.

1672
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,400
I want to be able to save this here, of course, there's like no way to

1673
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,100
do notes and visual studio in your debugging, because why would you be

1674
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,000
able to do that?

1675
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,500
So I got a copy it into an actual text buffer.

1676
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:35,600
So there's the mouse P that's we're starting with, right?

1677
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:38,600
There it is.

1678
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,500
And so we convert it to meters Mouse pee.

1679
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,500
Which is obviously, much smaller value.

1680
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:53,500
And there it is.

1681
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,100
And that seems sane, right?

1682
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:02,000
We were in this upper quadrant, I think so.

1683
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,900
That makes some sense, right?

1684
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:06,300
We then take the local Z which you already noticed.

1685
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:08,900
A fixed constant of 1 and we're going to unprotect it, right?

1686
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,100
So we come in here we're at a fixed distance of 1.

1687
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,200
So this is really just going to be 1 over the focal length.

1688
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,500
The focal length is .6.

1689
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,900
There's a projected X Y.

1690
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:21,200
So here is when we do that first on Project step, right?

1691
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:24,000
Here's what we got.

1692
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,200
Okay.

1693
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,900
That comes back.

1694
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,500
I've now got my world Mouse p and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

1695
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:40,800
go into push wrecked and I'm going to see what happens when we

1696
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,200
actually try to use this thing.

1697
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,000
Well.

1698
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,600
Step into pushback.

1699
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,400
Please God.

1700
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,900
Such okay.

1701
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,200
So inside push wrecked.

1702
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,400
The first thing we're going to do is make an offset here of this X Y

1703
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,000
value.

1704
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,700
And that's because we're drawing something of a dimension.

1705
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,400
I supposed to make this a little bit easier on ourselves, we probably

1706
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,100
should have made this Dimension, be 0.

1707
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:13,600
And I guess in fact, in this case, I probably can just do exactly that

1708
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,400
I can just reach in here and actually change these values.

1709
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:23,900
So that when we're doing this computation P Remains the Same, right?

1710
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:27,800
So when we do that computation, we end up actually.

1711
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,900
And this value, right?

1712
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,600
So now, our input value is exactly the same so that we're not even

1713
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,000
drawing a rectangle at all.

1714
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,200
We're just doing this.

1715
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:43,500
Okay, and we're passing in that Z, equals 8 value and that's because

1716
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,200
we're trying to account for the distance from Target thing.

1717
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,700
And so if I take a look to at the transform itself, the distance will

1718
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:53,000
Target was 8 and of course our Z was one.

1719
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,900
So I'm sorry it's nice and it was one so that be equals 8, which is

1720
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,800
what we would expect there.

1721
01:38:59,600 --> 01:38:59,800
ah,

1722
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:03,500
I meant to step into that.

1723
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,500
Let's try that one more time.

1724
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,100
Okay, so here we are.

1725
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,000
Here is our original P that's coming in.

1726
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:23,900
Which is what we expected it to be.

1727
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,100
We're going to transform it, presumably not at all.

1728
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:33,500
So it should be exactly the same and it is, we're not in orthographic

1729
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,400
transform.

1730
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,500
Our distance above Target is 9.

1731
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,200
So our distance to pz.

1732
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,000
What?

1733
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:48,100
Okay.

1734
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,400
oh,

1735
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,100
oh my God.

1736
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
How many times are we going to forget about this people?

1737
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:17,900
We took out.

1738
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:24,200
We took out Z movement.

1739
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,000
Relative to the basis B.

1740
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,900
We took that out.

1741
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:37,700
Remember we decided we didn't want that and we took that out.

1742
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,700
So this whole thing was probably working this fine.

1743
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,600
They're like never probably was a bug, get it at all.

1744
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:49,900
Oh my God.

1745
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,100
So basically like all we really actually had to do.

1746
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:55,800
Is this?

1747
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Hey, look at that.

1748
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:15,200
It's in exactly the right place.

1749
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:24,000
Well, at least it's good to have found it.

1750
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,600
Oh my God.

1751
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:39,900
Well, I hope you also had happened there.

1752
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:44,500
That was like by Design.

1753
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,900
That was like closed by Design with that bug report came in.

1754
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,500
We would have been like, nope, that's how it's supposed to work.

1755
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:55,900
Because remember, what we decided is, we didn't want to do anything.

1756
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,700
Since this is a stupid two and a half D nonsense again.

1757
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:04,300
Were you like don't use the offsets?

1758
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:11,800
Man, I think we should just go ahead and yeah we gotta like we got to

1759
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,300
figure out a better way to do the Z.

1760
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:17,000
That's so annoying but we tried and we couldn't figure out like a good

1761
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,600
way to do sort of like the two and a half D offset thing but that was

1762
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,400
all was we don't use the Z.

1763
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,400
So you pass in a z, doesn't matter what it is.

1764
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,300
It's not going to work.

1765
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,600
Lame.

1766
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:31,900
That is lame, dude, that is super lame.

1767
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:35,200
That is lame, lame.

1768
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,200
Lame stuff.

1769
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,500
To say, the very least.

1770
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:43,500
Alright.

1771
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:45,700
Chat did everyone understand that?

1772
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:48,200
What happened there?

1773
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,200
Hopefully everyone understood that.

1774
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:22,600
So, yeah.

1775
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:25,800
Unsurprisingly the bug was somewhere that we weren't expecting it,

1776
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,900
which is?

1777
01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:33,400
Yeah, I mean, if I had looked closer, I would have seen back but I

1778
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:36,800
never looked at that, that right there is the thing.

1779
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:41,400
And again, like I said, it was actually a feature that we implemented

1780
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,600
but I forgot that's how we did it, that's how we run to do it.

1781
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,000
Sorry, I don't know.

1782
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,400
Yeah, that's that's that's interesting.

1783
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,900
I think that's the first time on handmade hero.

1784
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:26,000
I can remember getting bitten by a feature.

1785
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:29,600
Where we were like, oh yeah.

1786
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,800
That's how it's supposed to work.

1787
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,100
Mmm.

1788
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:40,800
This two and a half D.

1789
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,200
Nonsense is so annoying.

1790
01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:46,100
But, I'm really not sure what's a better option.

1791
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:48,700
Right.

1792
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:49,500
I mean it's just

1793
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,900
That's just kind of the way it is.

1794
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:56,600
Just kind of how that stuff goes man, you know.

1795
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:08,200
All right, well, so surprised there was no bug but we were too dumb to

1796
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:11,400
know that and so the bug was was us.

1797
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:12,600
We were the bug.

1798
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:14,900
What you going to do?

1799
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,200
Well tomorrow.

1800
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
We'll go ahead and finish.

1801
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:20,400
What Iraq's?

1802
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,800
Well I guess not tomorrow because we're off tomorrow but Thursday we

1803
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,200
will go ahead and finish that.

1804
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:27,400
What should have been relatively simple?

1805
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:30,200
And what probably would have worked if we had remembered how our

1806
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,800
actual renderer Works which we don't but that's fine.

1807
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:34,800
All right, folks.

1808
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:37,600
The bug was us.

1809
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I will see you guys on Thursday for some more handmade hero when we

1810
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,300
will go ahead and finish what I actually wanted to do.

1811
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,000
And yeah and there you have it.

1812
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,800
So someone on the stream is asking if this bug would happen if you use

1813
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,200
a library.

1814
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:55,900
The answer is yes.

1815
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:59,700
Apparently because if the library was spec to work the way our stuff

1816
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:04,300
worked, we would have the exact same problem because we would not have

1817
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:05,100
known that.

1818
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:08,600
That's how they did things because we forgot apparently, even if

1819
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,900
Read the documentation and read about it, and then we would have made

1820
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:12,700
the same mistake.

1821
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:14,600
Oops.

1822
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,500
It happens sometimes, at least we found it.

1823
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,100
That's the important part.

1824
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,500
But it would be nice to maybe figure out some way to make it a little

1825
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:26,300
more intuitive.

1826
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:27,500
How those things work?

1827
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,400
Because in two and a half d, right?

1828
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,000
It's like

1829
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,700
I just wonder if there's some way of more cleanly, specifying two and

1830
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,300
a half D things in a way that we could.

1831
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:44,200
You know, that we wouldn't really forget the go be very clear from

1832
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,300
like a structure of it.

1833
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,300
What it meant, I don't know.

1834
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:49,900
But anyway, if you'd like to play around with this sort of stuff at

1835
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:54,700
home, you can certainly go to handmade here, a.org the source, code

1836
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,300
comes with the game.

1837
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,700
If you preorder it, so you can check that out if you want to.

1838
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:01,000
If you want to try finding some of these features on your own, you can

1839
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,900
certainly do that.

1840
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,500
But otherwise, that's all for today.

1841
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:07,200
You can as always support us on patreon.

1842
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,100
If you'd like to, you can go to the forums, ask questions.

1843
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:12,600
If you would like to you can also look at the annotated episode guide.

1844
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,800
You can check out the tweetbot which treats the schedule and yeah I

1845
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,000
think that's just about it until next time, which I guess.

1846
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,200
Will this this week will be Thursday at 5 p.m.

1847
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,100
Pacific Daylight time.

1848
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:29,400
Have fun programming guys and I will see you on the internet.

1849
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,100
Take it easy.
