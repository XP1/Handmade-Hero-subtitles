00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,100
The show we could complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:15,200
We are in the middle of enabling our game to sort of work in 3D, not

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,900
really for any particular 3D reasons because it is a 2-D game.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,700
But after going down the road of sprite sorting, I just decided that

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,500
it wouldn't really have the throughput that I was looking for even

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,300
though it was conceptually nice.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,800
And so, I wanted to find a way to use the GPU more effectively.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,600
Four more sort of heavy, heavy primitive counts and that sort of thing

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,700
that I thought we might want.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,000
So I decided even though I had not really wanted to go down that road

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,200
particularly much because I was trying to keep things focused on 2D, I

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,500
decided to switch to 3D just so we could have that.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,900
And so basically what we're doing right now is just finishing that

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,300
switch.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,900
I want to talk a little something that I did last week because I

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,900
realized after the fact that we probably don't really need to worry

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,300
about it as much as I thought we were going to have to worry about it,

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,400
because I was kind of thinking about things.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,100
In a way that I probably didn't really need to and I'll talk a little

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
bit about that in a second.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,800
But let me first explain what I did at the end of the stream last time

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
today is day 366 so you're going to want to.

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,000
You want going to want to grab that day 365 out of the source like

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,500
archive.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,400
If you want to follow along with what I'm doing, that is the code to

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,100
start with.

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,800
Let me go ahead and show you what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,900
So here is the build from last week and you can kind of see here that

30
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,800
what I'm doing is I'm just drawing.

31
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,100
These three Sprites so that they're always facing the camera.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
And I did that kind of at the end of last dream and I wanted to talk

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,100
about a little bit of that just in a second here.

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
So let me let me give you a little bit of a explanation of what I did

35
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,700
because I kind of threw it in, at the end of last week's dream just to

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,500
say, oh, we could do it this way, and I never really talked about it.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,900
So let me just talk about that really briefly, what I threw in there

38
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,600
because you notice I didn't really even do any math to do it.

39
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,400
I didn't have to write.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Blackboard, I just got typed it in in 10 seconds and it worked, fine.

41
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,900
So, you know, how did I do that?

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,800
What was that and why was it so easy or simple to do?

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,800
So let me go ahead and get some space here on the drawing board.

44
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
So, here's day 366.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,500
And so, this is camera.

46
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,900
Facing.

47
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,200
Cards.

48
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,200
So, the deal with this is the camera facing cards are sort of what we

49
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,300
need to do in order for Sprites, not to lie down flat.

50
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,700
Now if you take a look at for example the ground the ground right now

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,200
is lying down flat, right?

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
You can kind of see that you know those even I don't have it.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,900
Throw on them at the moment.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,800
So it's hard to maybe relate them back to the trees per se, but those

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,900
are just filled areas that could be filled with the texture.

56
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,400
And they, you know, form a flat kind of plane.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,700
When the camera moves around that plane is still the plane.

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Right.

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,400
And you can kind of see that the plane is behaving in 3D as it

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,500
normally would as if it was sort of a flat sheet and the problem if we

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
do that obviously,

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,200
with the Sprites that we have, and I'll go ahead and and just actually

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,800
make this happen here so you can see.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,000
So if I don't

65
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,100
If I don't allow any of the Sprites to stand upright, then you know

66
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,900
you can see what happens to the trees in this case, right?

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,400
They're just kind of stuck flat on the ground and you can see the

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,100
z-fighting care.

69
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,300
All of this stuff is stacked directly on top of each other.

70
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,100
So you end up with the Precision of the z-buffer, the iterator sort of

71
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,600
giving you random results as to who's in front of whom.

72
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,500
And so, if we look here, you can kind of see what happens if

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
everything lies down, right if I want these trees to appear, you know,

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,300
if this is the view

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Of the game we're going to typically take and I want these trees to

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,200
appear as they were probably intended by the artist.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,300
You know, I don't want them lying down flat.

78
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,800
So I want to have a way of having them appear as as if the artist you

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,300
know, exactly the way the artist drew them in a flat camera facing

80
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,200
way, right?

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,700
And so I want them to always be aligned with the screen and you can

82
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,400
see it leads to some odd effects, as I kind of, you know, flip around

83
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
here because the

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,900
Trees.

85
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,800
Look like they're always turning to face us because that's exactly

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
what they are doing.

87
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,800
We only have one view of the Sprite, so, no matter where we look,

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,900
we're always going to see that one view, but other than that, it

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,100
produces a very nice 3D version of this bright because you can see,

90
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,200
it's always providing the right aspect ratio and the right alignment

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,800
with the screen to give us that Sprites actual image to make that

92
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
Sprites image look correct.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Right?

94
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,000
So the question here is, how do I, you know, how did I do that?

95
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,200
And the answer is just that if I want to draw a camera facing card,

96
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,100
well, what do I know about my projection?

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Right?

98
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,600
Well, my projection Matrix is the thing that's going to take, right?

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,900
I've got a camera here.

100
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,300
And, you know, I've got an X and a z and a y of the camera and the

101
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,600
camera is, you know, looking out into the world, right and their stuff

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,000
out in the world, you know, maybe there's a cube sitting out here and

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,100
I'm viewing it, right?

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,400
And what we will know about this camera.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
Is that anything along the z-axis, right?

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,700
Is going to determine a certain depth information and it's going to

107
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,300
affect our perspective divide such that the further back you are, you

108
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,500
know, the further you are a negative Z relative to where the camera is

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,600
Remember this is in camera space here.

110
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,100
I'm talking about things on the cameras axis,

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
So, if I go along, Z the further, I go - Z the smaller things get so

112
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,900
things that are back here going to appear very small things that are

113
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,000
up here going to appear big and so the perspective Distortion is

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,200
happening along that z-axis.

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,100
However, if you think about what happens to the XY plane, so the plane

116
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,000
that the X and Y axes are in everything in one XY, plane,

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Has no varying Z component, right?

118
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
That's the definition of the XY plane.

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,500
In this case is that the Z component is the same everywhere and I

120
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
could move that plane anywhere.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
I want along the z-axis, right?

122
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,100
And as long as I'm still talking about a plane aligned with the X and

123
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,600
y-axes everything in the plane, has the same Z coordinate.

124
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,000
That means there's no Distortion as to the elongation of one part of

125
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,600
something in the plane versus another, this

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,500
Kurt right of the plane.

127
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
And this part of the plane are going to appear.

128
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,900
Exactly the same distance away from the viewer, okay?

129
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,700
It's not going to get elongated in some weird way where if I was

130
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,000
talking about a plane that was say, not that way like a plane that was

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
sort of this way, right?

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Then this part would appear much further away than this part which

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,700
would appear closer, right?

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,500
And so if I were to draw something on that, non XY plane,

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,300
And it would warp, right?

136
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,500
I would get you know if I was looking at it here's my screen and I'm

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,800
looking at these things, something aligned to the XY plane looks like

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,500
that, it looks like a Sprite card that's facing the camera, which is

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,900
what we would want something that's drawn on this plane would look

140
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,100
more like this, right?

141
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,400
This back part would get shrunk down, you know, because it's further

142
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,500
away in z.

143
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,600
So what that means is, if we want to draw things which retained their

144
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,100
rectangular, right angle nature, when pushed through the perspective,

145
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,600
projection, it's actually very simple.

146
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,200
We just need to keep them on the XY plane, right?

147
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,299
And more specifically any XY plane, it doesn't matter what the Z can

148
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,200
be, the Z can be anything as long as it's the same on all of them,

149
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,200
right?

150
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
So now comes the question.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,700
How do we produce points that are on an XY plane relative to the

152
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,200
camera, right?

153
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,900
Because remember, we're sending down these points in World space.

154
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,800
Right.

155
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,000
We're sending down these things in the same space as everything else.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,900
Including where, how the camera specified that world's face might be

157
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,700
some other thing that's like over here, right?

158
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,800
And has different axes.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
These are the camera axes, but the world axes.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Where everything else is specified in terms of and the origin of the

161
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,000
world and everything else.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,700
This is the cameras position, right?

163
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,700
These could be totally different, they don't have to coincide in any

164
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,000
way.

165
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
The axes don't have to point in any

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,700
Similarly, the position can be different whatever, right?

167
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,900
Even the scale could be different if we wanted.

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,000
So the question becomes if we're submitting things in World space, how

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,800
do we produce things that are on an XY plane in camera space, right?

170
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Because we don't know what the XY axes are in that space in world

171
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
space, right?

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,300
We don't, we need to be able to talk about XY planes in World space

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
that are XY planes in the camera space.

174
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,300
So the X and Y axis of the world, don't help us here, right?

175
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,700
They don't tell us the information but lucky for us.

176
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,000
We know the cameras, XY axes because we use that we passed the X and Y

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
axis down to create our camera transform in the first place.

178
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,000
So, what that means is we still have the camera X and Y axis, lying

179
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,600
around.

180
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
So all we have to do, if we want a Sprite card to be facing the camera

181
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,000
properly is, we just have to go ahead and make sure that the axes, we

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,600
use to construct the Sprite, or the X and Y, axes of the camera object

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,200
itself.

184
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,500
Those two axes will tell us exactly what a constant X Y plane would

185
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,500
look like in World space because they are the two spanning axes of

186
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,200
that space, right?

187
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,300
The Z axis of the camera is the thing that tells us the direction

188
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,100
along which we cannot move if we want our Sprite to remain in the

189
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,700
same.

190
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,200
In the same.

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,900
X, Y plane.

192
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:04,800
Okay.

193
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,900
So what I did?

194
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,900
Is exists.

195
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,900
It's not what I want.

196
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,500
What I did is exactly what you would expect.

197
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,900
You can see here, I took the x axis and the y axis of the entry that I

198
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,000
was trying to create.

199
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,600
And I just assigned to those the size that we wanted, the Sprite to be

200
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,900
an X and I use the cameras x-axis as the access for that.

201
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,800
And I took the size.

202
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,700
We want it in y.

203
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,100
And I use the cameras y-axis for that and that's exactly what we want

204
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,700
in order to create the sort of span for the Sprite.

205
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,600
In camera space, basically, rather than world's face, even though we

206
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,200
have to express it in World space, we can do that by just using the

207
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,700
cameras X and Y, axes as defined in World space, right?

208
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
That's what these are.

209
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,000
This is the cameras, x axis defined in World space, the cameras y-axis

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
to find in World space.

211
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,800
So we use those and we get exactly what

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
You want, right?

213
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,100
And so when we use those, we get our Sprite sort of standing up

214
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,800
exactly like we want them to always facing the camera.

215
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,500
So, that's exactly what we want to do there.

216
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,700
The problem here is that we need a little more than that.

217
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,200
So if you imagine this might be, you know, and this is probably a

218
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,400
little bit too steep so I mean not sleep enough.

219
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,900
If you imagine the game wants to look roughly like this and this is

220
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,400
like the dude kind of coming around here.

221
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,000
You know, if we want the game to look roughly that perspective?

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Then the question is well.

223
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Okay, what exactly are we going to do?

224
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
If the camera is at that perspective, what are we going to do about

225
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
sorting these Sprites?

226
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,900
Into the world because, you know, like I said, be kind of want them to

227
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:59,000
stick sort of layer together and it might be that this is non is this

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,200
is not a sufficient amount of of standing up for the Sprites.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Now, it might be, I don't really know.

230
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,200
It might be enough.

231
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,400
But what I want to do is First add a way that we can look at how much

232
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,500
they are standing up.

233
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
And then if we want to and we need to, we can go in and try to figure

234
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,900
out a way to add some more.

235
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Sort of puff them out further if that makes sense, the way that we

236
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,000
were planning on doing it before.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,500
Only, I realized sort of after doing this, that we probably want to

238
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,900
start with this construction rather than this construction.

239
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,900
Because we do probably want them to always do X and Y axis facing like

240
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,300
this.

241
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,700
So that's sort of a separate thing.

242
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,500
Anyway, so ignore ignoring this part for a second and just focusing on

243
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,100
this part.

244
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,000
What I want to do here is just introduce the again, the concept of a

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,100
deep debug camera.

246
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,500
We've used this in the past and handmade hero, we have the about

247
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,700
camera, but we don't really have support for the rotation.

248
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,500
It now only, you know, we're sort of had it for zooming out is the is

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
the thing we had it for.

250
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,200
So, if you take a look at this, the way we have it now,

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,500
We can move the camera around, but there's only one concept of where

252
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,400
the camera is.

253
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,700
What that means is that these Sprites right are always facing the

254
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,500
actual camera, I'm using to view the world even though what I really

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,200
want in this, you know, ability to rotate the world around, this is

256
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,600
not the game, will not let you do that, right?

257
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,800
So, the reason I have I put this camera in is so that I can use it for

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
debug in order to use it for debug.

259
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,000
I need these Sprite cards to remain fixed at their locations and

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,400
orientations in the world, while I rotate around because my rotating

261
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,700
around like that.

262
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Is the thing I'm going to use to inspect them for debugging.

263
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,700
So what that means is again we need that concept of to sort of

264
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,000
separate things.

265
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,700
We need the concept of a sort of the debug camera and the actual gain

266
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,800
camera and we need to be able to switch between those, right?

267
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,300
And so if you take a look at render group and we've got this sort of

268
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,100
notion in render group of, you know, here's some some information

269
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
about the camera and then here is the prescription.

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Section Matrix, this camera information here we're using to generate

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,100
our Sprites and so what we really want to do I think is say that this

272
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,200
projection Matrix here maybe is going to be the thing that that the

273
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,500
camera that's actually using the renderer but these gear can be set

274
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,700
separately so they can always be set to the game's camera and the

275
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,000
debug camera can be something else that overrides this right.

276
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,300
So if we were to do something like that, you can see in here.

277
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,600
We sort of have this set camera transform situation and you can see

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,900
how it's getting set.

279
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,500
Their what I want to do here perhaps is introduced to the September

280
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,100
transform call and I don't know, this might be a little bit.

281
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,100
Sort of janky at the moment so we'll see how it goes and we'll adjust

282
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,500
as necessary if we need something a little bit fancier.

283
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,400
But if I were to go ahead here and just adjust this so that I instead

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,300
of taking a Boolean for Ortho, I have like camera transform flag idea.

285
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,200
And so I could do like camera is Ortho is one of them.

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,300
Maybe orthographic camera is debug.

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,700
Another one.

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,400
and so now in here, instead of taking that Ortho idea, I'm going to

289
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,600
take flags and then we can say well okay if it's Ortho is just if the

290
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,900
flags and camera is or at the graphic is set, then it'll be Ortho and

291
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,700
I can say that it's a debug

292
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Camera.

293
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,700
If it's got his debug set and then when we come through here, I can

294
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,800
choose to not update certain pieces of information if it's a debug

295
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:33,700
camera, so I can say if it's debug, you know, maybe don't set these

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,200
things that I'm using for sprite generation because I want the Sprites

297
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,600
to be generated as if there wasn't any of that.

298
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,800
All right, so let's go ahead and jump into the world mode where this

299
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,700
is being set.

300
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
And we can see the set camera, transform call happening here and you

301
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,400
can see that it's going along and doing this Z rotation thing.

302
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,800
So, what I want,

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,100
here is I want to pass and I could, if I wanted to do a thing here,

304
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,600
where I do camera is perspective,

305
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I suppose I could do something like that even though there's really

306
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,500
not much need for it, but if I wanted to, I could, you know, I don't

307
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,300
think that's necessary.

308
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,700
Let's just say that's just a little more information, but it's just

309
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,400
not necessary.

310
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,900
So, here we can do to set camera transforms, right?

311
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
And what I'll do is I'll do one.

312
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,800
That's, that's the actual camera.

313
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,000
And one that is debug like.

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,500
So and what I'll do is in the one where we do set camera transform,

315
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,400
For the regular one, I'm going to forego the debug camera orbit, debug

316
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
camera pitch stuff, right.

317
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
So, basically, what I'll do is say, okay, you know, here's the debug

318
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,700
one.

319
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,200
What camera offset, z w, World mode camera all set.

320
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,800
So I guess what I want to do here is say

321
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,000
I guess what?

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
I really want to do here say

323
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,300
That the camera off set.

324
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,200
in this case is actually, oops is actually

325
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,500
I want to add to the Z.

326
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:47,900
So I guess I could just do you know, camera offset plus D3 and just

327
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,800
stick this in the Z component, right?

328
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,700
All right.

329
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,200
And so here, let me go ahead and put that down here because this is

330
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,300
actually where we want it.

331
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,700
So, what I want to do here is I'm going to go ahead and set camera,

332
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,400
orbit and Camera pitch as opposed to debug camera orbit and debug

333
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,200
camera pitch, and then we'll have a camera Dolly there as well.

334
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,900
So we can essentially have all of this stuff set up as we want, and

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,600
then we can do this twice one with debug and one without.

336
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,700
So if I go up here,

337
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,100
And I add those in.

338
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,900
what I can do it for now is to set those directly because right now we

339
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,400
don't actually need them to be anything other than prescribed values

340
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,000
and

341
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,800
put those in there.

342
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,600
So if I have these as prescribed values, I don't need the the

343
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,600
At this point and the orbit in the pitch I probably will never use the

344
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,100
orbit in the actual game.

345
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,700
So it's really just the pitch and the pitch is going to be I guess,

346
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,100
probably, something like I said fairly steep.

347
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm not sure exactly what it'll be.

348
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,900
We'll have to play with it but

349
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Yeah, something.

350
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,300
Whoo.

351
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,100
That's not exactly what I expected to see.

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,900
I think I did something slightly wrong there.

353
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,300
Oh, right, I did do something slightly wrong there.

354
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,500
So

355
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,100
I should probably also have some way of switching between these now

356
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,900
that I think about it.

357
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm not sure exactly how I should do that because I need to, I need to

358
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,500
be able to flip back and forth so they're effectively needs to be

359
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,400
something here.

360
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,700
Right.

361
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,000
And I'd like that something to be pretty quick, I guess I could use

362
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,700
maybe the right Mouse button for the moment or something like this and

363
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
see, I don't know.

364
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,400
But I will need something here.

365
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,300
Where it's like, use debug camera.

366
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,900
Yeah, and I want some way to switch really quickly between those two.

367
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,300
Let's take a look here.

368
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,300
I don't know if we have any useful Keys, really.

369
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Yeah, not so much.

370
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,600
I could decide to a debug variable later, although a debug variables,

371
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,300
a little cumbersome to go up and set.

372
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,300
So I don't know that.

373
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,600
That's really the best choice there.

374
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,500
But what I can do now is just say, if input.

375
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:09,800
Input Mouse buttons for Mouse button, right?

376
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Then we will do hold mode.

377
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Use the video camera.

378
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
And we're good.

379
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:31,300
So this is the actual game camera here and my like rotating around

380
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,300
doesn't do anything.

381
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,700
If I switch to the right Mouse button whoops, I need I knew that to be

382
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,300
went down because I don't want to constantly toggle between them.

383
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,300
Feel like we had one, something like that was pressed.

384
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,100
There we go.

385
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,600
So if I toggle between them, now I can switch between these two.

386
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,900
So here's the game camera and all the Sprites are.

387
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,800
Facing properly towards the camera itself.

388
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,600
If I switch to the debug camera.

389
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,900
Now, when I rotate around, I can sort of see how everything is

390
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,400
aligned, right?

391
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,400
And the thing that concerns me is what I was trying to get to before

392
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,700
is just that if you take a look at how these guys are sort of sloped

393
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,100
there,

394
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,600
You can see how they are really kind of steeply.

395
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:38,300
Angled they cross over into the next cell boundary really early and I

396
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,900
just worry about that as being potentially too much.

397
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know, the thing is I guess and you know, I don't really know but I

398
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,800
guess

399
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,400
It's okay.

400
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,300
Well, I don't know I don't know that it is because for example if we

401
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:06,500
were to have something in this location here that was, you know,

402
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,700
sticking up straight.

403
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,200
Like you know, if this Cube or kind of coming up here

404
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,300
This would interpenetrate in.

405
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,200
That would be bad.

406
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,500
And so, I feel like from back here, which is the game camera, right?

407
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So, from back here, I want it to look like this, but I want ways of

408
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,600
doing that, that will push it more up into its own square, right?

409
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,300
So I wanted to come closer to me,

410
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
But I need it to still retain its shape properly.

411
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,000
That's the trick right?

412
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,800
And you know I guess there's ways I could maybe do that with just

413
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,100
modifying what the Z coordinate actually is going to be because I do

414
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,500
have opportunities for doing that.

415
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,100
I suppose in ways that would make it so that the Z coordinate was

416
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
different but

417
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:03,800
What?

418
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Yeah.

419
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
I don't know that I want to go that route right eye.

420
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,600
I guess what I'm saying is so the Z buffer is going to operate on the

421
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,500
information that we tell it to, right?

422
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,800
We are providing the Z coordinates to work with for the Z buffer and

423
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,700
we could choose if we wanted to to provide different information from

424
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,500
the z-buffer than the actual Z coordinates were using to draw the

425
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,700
world right?

426
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,500
and they would, you know, that would essentially

427
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,300
give us the ability to prevent things from intersecting with each

428
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,200
other in those in those cases.

429
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,900
I don't know if we want to do that or if we want to do something that

430
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:57,200
pulls these things forward in a way that preserves their perspective.

431
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,800
It's kind of a tough call.

432
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,200
But to be honest, I do think that I probably I'm I'm leaning a little

433
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,100
towards just using an additional value there because it does seem like

434
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:17,300
that would be much simpler if we have the world looking like this and

435
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,700
we simply change the Z values so that they increase much more

436
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,700
gradually than they would given the actual Z values here.

437
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,200
So that

438
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,800
yeah, you get, you know, different results.

439
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,000
I feel like that that might be the easiest solution.

440
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,900
Because I guess there's, you know, I can't think of any real reason to

441
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,800
do sort of the more advanced math.

442
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,900
You know, we did the math out there for doing the intersection and

443
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,200
bringing the, you know, figuring out a way to preserve the apparent

444
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
size of the Sprite.

445
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,700
But, you know, do we really want to bother doing that math?

446
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,100
On every Sprite all the time when we could just fake the Z coordinate

447
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,800
by passing down as the different Z?

448
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
Nets at the corners.

449
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Then the actual Z coordinates were using to draw because that's one of

450
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,200
the things that we can do.

451
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,800
You know with modern programmable gpus is we don't have to confine

452
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:36,100
ourselves to just using Z as the Z that we use for rejection doesn't

453
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,600
have to be the Z that we use for the depth buffer we can use a

454
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,200
different value entirely for the depth buffer and the card doesn't

455
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,500
care.

456
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,300
It just needs to know where to get it from.

457
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,700
It doesn't have to be tied specifically, to where we are.

458
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,800
Placing the, the Sprite in the world so that does seem kind of

459
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,900
compelling and maybe that's a good way to go.

460
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,200
I kind of like that that seems pretty good to me so, so let's maybe.

461
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,500
Take that a little step further.

462
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,800
What I'd like to do now is say okay.

463
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,400
You know that's the Sprite cards.

464
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,600
Could just be the way that we do them exactly like that.

465
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,900
And we still have to deal with the alpha issue but otherwise the

466
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Sprites look like they should look.

467
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,100
And I can play the game the way that I want to play it at the roughly,

468
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,800
the perspective that I want, I would also mention that this is not

469
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,200
private perspective that I want I wanted to be even steeper than that.

470
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,500
I was looking for a very steep angle in the game.

471
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,700
Probably something more like this, right?

472
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,200
Maybe even.

473
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,200
Maybe even more, you know, I don't know.

474
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,800
It's hard to say, but a very steep angle and so, you know, at that

475
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:59,800
point, you can really see to these Sprites are just our only barely

476
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:07,800
You know, only barely rising up out of their area, but this is more

477
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,600
what I wanted.

478
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,700
You know, I really didn't want very much perspective there.

479
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
You know, that was not my intent, I just needed some.

480
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,100
I wanted a little bit of perspective since we're going to have the

481
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,000
ability to do that.

482
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,700
I want.

483
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,000
Maybe just a little bit of that.

484
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,900
And so as you kind of move through the world,

485
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,400
It's just that that little tiniest bit.

486
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,200
We could also I suppose go for one that's

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
that's directly flat on.

488
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,900
But of course, again in that situation, we do have to think about how

489
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,400
we're going to stand this rights up at, maybe that answer to how we're

490
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,400
standing those Sprites up.

491
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
In that case would be that we would just

492
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Again fake that that Z coordinate.

493
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,300
So I don't know.

494
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,100
The other thing is to we may find as we go a little further down that

495
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,400
that it does look a little nicer to have that sort of perspective be a

496
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,700
little bit different like it is here I'm not entirely certain that's a

497
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:15,100
good question and so you know I guess it remains to be seen because

498
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,800
the game is sort of played in in a tile-based fashion.

499
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,200
I feel like that gives us

500
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,700
Opportunities to maybe have a more oblique perspective like this

501
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,300
because it means that you're not so concerned about lining things up

502
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,800
precisely in 3D because the tiles, you know, kind of do that for you

503
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,600
and make it easier for you to do things in three dimensions that that

504
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,100
would ordinarily be a lot harder to do.

505
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:50,800
So I feel like that might be that might

506
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,000
That might be all.

507
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
We really need to do there, I don't know.

508
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
That's a good question.

509
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,800
The other thing though that I would point out is that, you know, we do

510
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,200
want to have sort of done Janee walls here so it wouldn't just be

511
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,700
trees.

512
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,900
And so like I said, we kind of need to take a look at sort of The Next

513
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,400
Step here, which is to to sort of get some 3D blocks in there.

514
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,000
All right, so let's postpone thinking about that.

515
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,500
Z for a little bit because we're going to need to pop over to the

516
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,900
opengl layer and do a bunch of stuff on that.

517
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,700
Maybe that'll be next weekend, but we're going to have to be able to

518
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,400
load shaders and be able to set what we want, our depth stuff to be

519
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,300
and that sort of stuff.

520
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,200
So we have work, we're going to have to do there, where?

521
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,100
Yeah, it's going to be a little bit more complicated, but

522
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,600
And we also need to do the multi sample anti-aliasing stuff.

523
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,800
So we just have a bunch of like literally nothing but opengl busy work

524
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
to do over there to just basically bring the GPU in line with the

525
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,800
stuff that we want to be able to do in terms of setting up.

526
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,500
The rendering, right?

527
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,600
So we do have to pop over there and do that at some point soon.

528
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,700
But I don't know that I want to do that quite yet because I would like

529
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,400
to also now start passing down some more 3D like Primitives.

530
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,600
And I think that for the most part will involve us having to set some

531
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,100
or provide some other options in our render pass.

532
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,000
so, the problem here,

533
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,100
Because we have to think a little bit about how we're submitting

534
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,000
things to the render in the first place.

535
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,400
Because we were doing things in the simple 2-D game before we really

536
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,100
just submitted things as Sprites because that is what we primarily

537
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,600
conceptualize our world to be is, you know, hey, we've got these like

538
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,200
2D images and they're on the screen somewhere and that's, you know,

539
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,000
whatever that is great.

540
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,400
But what I'd like to be able to do is I'd like to be able to in

541
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,700
addition to Sprites.

542
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,600
So you know I've got

543
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Things like that tree are a rectangle.

544
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,400
That's drawn.

545
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,199
Essentially with two triangles, right?

546
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,900
One here and one here and that is how we're drawing individual

547
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,400
Sprites.

548
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
This Alpha knocks out this area.

549
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,800
I would also like the ability to draw basically cubes.

550
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,800
So I would like, for those things on the ground, you know, to

551
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,000
basically cubes that kind of look like this to the viewer, right?

552
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,699
Because they're kind of at an angle here.

553
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,199
So this is, you know, the top of the cube.

554
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Looking down on.

555
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,000
And so the world as it stands is kind of this collection of these

556
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,800
cubes, you know, kind of like a, a Vox League game like a Minecraft e

557
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,000
sort of a thing has kind of more overtly, you know,

558
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,700
where you've got things that are kind of made out of these, like Cube

559
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,600
like pieces, you know, sort of a situation,

560
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,600
And I want the ability to do something like that and I need the

561
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,500
ability to map images onto those, right?

562
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,600
I want to be able to put textures on there so that you know when we

563
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,500
have a dungeon area whatever it can have dungeon imagery, you know

564
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,300
dungeon tile sets on the wall, if it's a house or something can have

565
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,200
wood, paneling whatever right?

566
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:39,200
Basically, whatever the artists are conceiving for what, you know, you

567
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,800
would want to put whatever an artist might think of that they want to

568
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,700
put on there, just being able to put stuff on there and we need to be

569
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,900
able to put different things on all the different sides of the cube.

570
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,100
We also need to have some way of being able to do some lighting on

571
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,600
here.

572
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,100
Meaning that like these kind of Corners, you know, we want to be able

573
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,800
to specify information at the corners probably.

574
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,400
They would allow us to do some sort of a darkening, you know.

575
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,900
So we can kind of in here make it get darker when we get in areas that

576
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,600
are like lower down and less visible or you know

577
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,900
Who knows any number of things?

578
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,100
We may want to put Lighting in there.

579
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,600
We may want to do all sorts of stuff like that.

580
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:33,200
So the problem with that is right that really breaks up our notion of

581
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,300
what we are sending down to the GPU because now not only are we

582
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,500
sending down this notion of these sort of textured cards that are

583
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,100
facing the viewer or doing whatever else.

584
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,200
But we also have this concept of

585
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Of a little bit more of a structural thing.

586
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,400
Now, it's not a complicated structural thing.

587
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,900
It's not the Utah teapot or whatever.

588
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
It's just

589
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,400
Very simple Cubes but we're still going to need some way of

590
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
communicating that information.

591
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,300
And we're going to need some way.

592
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,700
Of efficiently specifying stuff like what image goes on each side of a

593
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,500
cube and where the cube is that sort of stuff.

594
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Now, the simplest way to do this would be to just specify each Cube as

595
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,200
an element, as a render element, and that may be what I do first.

596
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,500
But,

597
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,300
We may find that to be an adequate going forwards and we may have to

598
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,100
adjust things to accommodate for it.

599
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:36,900
but,

600
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,500
Let's see here.

601
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,400
That's Ed.

602
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,400
I need to buy my nose.

603
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,700
It's going to be allergy season here.

604
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Case anyone was wondering.

605
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,000
All right.

606
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,700
So, you know, if we want to do just the basic version of this, you

607
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,500
know, we've got these sort of different render types here, so maybe I

608
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,600
would just say like, okay we've got bitmaps and I also in addition to

609
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
bitmaps want to be able to draw cubes.

610
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,400
Right.

611
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And a cube is just a thing, which specifies the data on the corners of

612
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,100
the cube that I need.

613
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:54,300
So maybe I've got a render entry Cube and the cube, you know, could be

614
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,200
specified, I guess is just like

615
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,300
I mean I guess I don't really want a cube per se because I want it to

616
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,300
be an arbitrary height.

617
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:14,300
So I need a height value for the cube but otherwise I just need like a

618
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,100
radius value for the cube because it's a cube and it can't really

619
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,900
elongate

620
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,500
they're supposed to be tile shaped.

621
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,600
So I've got a height and I've got a radius and that specifies, pretty

622
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,700
much everything there is to specify about the cube other than just

623
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
the, you know, the point in three dimensions, where the cube is

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,700
centered about.

625
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,800
And I think what I might do is say that's the like, you know,

626
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,500
Oops.

627
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:53,200
You know it's like the the middle of the top face of the cube just for

628
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,700
now I'm going to say that that's what that is so you know, that's a

629
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,100
cube we can specify and I don't know if we want to specify like an X

630
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,900
and Y axis, kind of a thing for it.

631
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,400
You know, it's it's do.

632
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,900
We want to have cubes that spin around.

633
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,300
I don't know for now, I'll just say no but because we can always add

634
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:18,900
that later.

635
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,400
And so really that's all I need other than the fact that I'm going to

636
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,100
need a loaded bitmap there to draw my cube right.

637
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,900
The texture for it basically,

638
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,300
and I guess I'll probably put a Primo color in there as well because

639
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,900
that's obviously something that's going to need just like, you know,

640
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,300
the

641
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,600
just like the bitmaps can be colorized, so you can tint whatever you

642
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,100
have for the color of your of your Sprite.

643
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
You can do the same thing in the case of the cube.

644
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,900
So, in order to do the cube, again, it's really not going to be

645
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:01,500
particularly complicated inside handmade render group, we have to do,

646
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:06,700
essentially the same thing that we were doing before know where my

647
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,700
pushed bitmap call is.

648
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,700
It is

649
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,200
so um inside my push bitmap call essentially I'm doing the exact same

650
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,400
thing and kind of see here,

651
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,500
We've got the the version that has the bitmap loaded in the version,

652
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,900
that doesn't have the bitmap loaded yet or at least doesn't know if it

653
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,300
at the book map, loads just using the ID, we pretty much want to have

654
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,600
a push Cube call that I guess is going to do roughly the same thing.

655
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,000
So you know we've got pretty much the same parameters.

656
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,900
I think for the most part, I don't know that we really need an object

657
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,300
transform here for any particular reason, because the object transform

658
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,500
kind of just has a bunch of stuff.

659
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,000
We don't really

660
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Need right.

661
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,000
And to be honest.

662
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,400
We probably don't need the object transform.

663
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,800
For the bitmaps anymore, either.

664
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,800
About that separate issue.

665
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,600
Anyway.

666
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,200
so,

667
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,000
here we are in our first view.

668
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,400
Let me get rid of this for now.

669
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,900
We've got a group, a bitmap ID, or height.

670
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,800
IR p and I need the radius there.

671
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,600
I'll just make these in roughly the same order they come.

672
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,200
And and then we've got that color as well.

673
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,600
The alignment is not here.

674
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,800
We don't have any of this, that's all gone.

675
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,300
So we need to do the same thing we're doing before, right?

676
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
And I renders in background is not a thing that groups do anymore.

677
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,500
So I'm not sure that should even be there.

678
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm pretty sure that's never set for anybody under any circumstances.

679
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,100
Yeah, I don't think it is so let's go ahead and take that out.

680
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,700
Here, there we go.

681
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
so, if I were to get rid of renders and background,

682
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,600
does anyone care?

683
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,800
Nope.

684
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,300
And because I think that was just for ground chunks so that she can go

685
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:05,800
away.

686
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,600
So in this case, renders in background,

687
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
Those are going away.

688
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,600
And in this case, I've got my push Cube call.

689
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,600
I'll just weld this in at the moment here.

690
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,800
And will separate them out only if we actually need to later.

691
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,000
all right, so what I want to do here is I want to push one of these

692
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
render entries

693
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,500
and the render entryway want is render entry Cube.

694
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,700
If I get one back successfully, I will push on the bitmap that I'm

695
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,500
expecting.

696
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,200
The p is going to be this p.

697
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,700
and then, I've got

698
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:20,900
height.

699
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,100
Radius.

700
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,700
And I'm good.

701
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,500
So my store color here still take sort of this lerp situation.

702
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:42,700
And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to kind of get rid of this as

703
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,200
well.

704
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,800
I feel like this T color color thing was this was only for fog and the

705
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,500
fog is irrelevant now because we can do the fog in the actual back

706
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:53,900
end.

707
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,000
So what we want to do is is I think just get rid

708
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:04,800
this entirely and make it so that this is, you know, just directly

709
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,200
taking what we would expect.

710
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,500
Here we go and doing that multiply

711
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,200
We go.

712
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,000
Let's get rid of that in this case as well.

713
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:48,100
Okay, and similarly I suppose while we're at it while we're cleaning

714
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,700
things up here, we can take a look at the object transform and we can

715
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,000
get rid of that.

716
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:55,500
Right.

717
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,100
And so now really nothing should happen.

718
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,100
I mean, all we did was add a new primitive, we just added push Cube,

719
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,400
and that's that's it.

720
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,300
So you know, we don't need anything else there for the moment.

721
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,200
But now, if we actually want to use the push Cube information, we need

722
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,800
to actually add it in here to the render.

723
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,400
Now, in order to motivate that I should probably actually make one of

724
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,600
these things because otherwise you're going to add it and nobody is

725
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
going to use it and that's not very exciting.

726
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,200
So what I'm going to do here is we're taking a bunch of these

727
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,800
rectangles to draw these traversable.

728
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,700
As you can see that,

729
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:39,200
Happening here, where I've got this, like, push rectangle thing that's

730
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,700
happening and you can kind of see to when I'm doing that.

731
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:50,100
You know, I'm I'm sort of if I remember correctly and World mode, we

732
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,900
were creating our standard room, it could have variance and Z, but we

733
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,700
turned it off.

734
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,600
So, you know, you could have like, sort of these, these Heights and

735
00:47:59,600 --> 00:47:59,800
and

736
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,600
Just in in various things.

737
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,400
So if I wanted to, you know, I can get this this offset Z here I think

738
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,600
and I believe that'll just, you know, oh,

739
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,200
evidently not.

740
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,500
Well, again, that's you know what, though?

741
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,600
That may just be because of

742
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,000
Setting up where the person is in the game.

743
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,300
We do have a weird thing right now with when we actually create the

744
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,200
player.

745
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,700
I'm kind of interesting interested to know.

746
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,900
In check for joining players when we call get closest reversible.

747
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,300
We never really went in and looked at what was happening in here.

748
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,800
Let me quickly debug that because I feel like that's a problem.

749
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,500
Let's see here.

750
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,700
Because we should be able to tweak the Z by something and not have it

751
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,500
create a problem, right?

752
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,100
Okay, don't see why that would be an issue in any particular way, but

753
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,300
it obviously is and I do think that's because we're currently, we've

754
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,800
got some stuff with our way that we're doing those.

755
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,900
Collision things.

756
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,200
You can see like for reasons that we never bothered to debug our hero

757
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,400
starts over there.

758
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,400
We do not know why he started over there, right?

759
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,600
We were in the middle of a bunch of changes.

760
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,800
We never looked at what was going on there, so I want to do a quick

761
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,400
check.

762
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,400
I have a feeling that where were actually placing him is totally bogus

763
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,500
at the moment,

764
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,600
And it probably has to do with the fact that we're not placing him

765
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,000
anywhere in particular.

766
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,000
In any particular smart location.

767
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,700
So let me take a look here.

768
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,200
Because the order in which things happen when you enter the game, is a

769
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,000
little janky the way that we did.

770
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,600
It was just yeah it's not great and it is probably something that will

771
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,200
have to

772
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,100
Fix it some point.

773
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,900
But anyway, if we come through here, you know, the way that this works

774
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,700
is the first time through we call check for joining players and we do

775
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,200
get one, it's the player who is automatically joining.

776
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:07,000
And so the I think we actually stuff that start value in a forced way,

777
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:07,900
right?

778
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,600
You can see here that if one this in which we have, we basically

779
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,600
forced the player to be pressing the button so that they would enter

780
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,300
the game as if they pressed it.

781
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,000
So what?

782
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,200
Because so we don't have to start at the title screen every time.

783
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,000
So if we look here where we got that pressed, start that

784
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,700
That means that we are actually working with the same region that

785
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,700
we've set up here and we're not actually we don't know where the

786
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,500
camera is yet, right.

787
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,000
That's kind of the busted part about this is the first time through

788
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,400
the camera hasn't actually been set because the camera is not going to

789
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,100
get set until we hit n Sim.

790
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,400
Right.

791
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,600
And Sim is the thing that actually sets up the camera for us in terms

792
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,500
of figuring out where the camera should go.

793
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,000
And we're not even, you know, we're not really doing that.

794
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,400
So I think part of the problem here is, you know, the location of the

795
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,800
guy, you know, 000 should be right in the middle of the same region,

796
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,100
but it's probably not.

797
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,800
And so, we'll have to see what happens there.

798
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,000
Anyway, we look at the traversable here.

799
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,200
Let me actually step into that.

800
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,800
I want to see.

801
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,500
Yeah.

802
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,100
So here is get closest reversible because look at the closest distance

803
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:59,800
squared so the closest distance squared is 2 meters squared away.

804
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:05,600
So not actually that far away looks like

805
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,100
So that's interesting, but let me go ahead and check now too.

806
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,300
What happens if I make that change?

807
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,300
That I want to make before.

808
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,100
Like so.

809
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,900
So it finds the same location to stand, so that doesn't seem to

810
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,900
actually be the problem, so that's good.

811
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,500
And when we add a hero, you know, everyone's happy.

812
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,800
And let's take a look inside the world mode camera because I want to

813
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,200
know where we actually are.

814
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,600
So there's no offset to the camera in particular.

815
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,500
And these are relatively sane values.

816
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,000
Right.

817
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,300
We're at 76.

818
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,200
In both cases.

819
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,100
And that stays pretty with no offset.

820
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,200
And that stays pretty

821
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,100
pretty much the same.

822
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,200
Right now, let's take a look.

823
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,700
We all that looks pretty reasonable to me.

824
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,400
Yet we get nothing on the screen.

825
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,900
Do that.

826
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,800
That's a little weird.

827
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,000
Get two of those for some reason.

828
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,400
No, okay.

829
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,700
So I'm not sure why we end up with the nothing on the screen.

830
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,500
This and I want to know why that is

831
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,100
I was expecting it to be something with.

832
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,900
With the camera but I'm not sure that that's actually the case.

833
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,000
And there we do get more of an offset.

834
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,800
All right, I'm going to take a look at what.

835
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,400
We're what our camera is in the case, where we don't do that.

836
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,800
and I do not know why didn't feel the need to break their but I'd

837
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,500
wanted it to

838
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,500
All right.

839
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,000
So it looks like the problem is pretty simple.

840
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,800
Actually, it looks like the problem is just because we're not doing

841
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,800
the room.

842
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,600
Sizing stuff correctly at the moment.

843
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,100
Anyway,

844
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,800
because we're not doing that correctly, it looks

845
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Picking a room below where we should be picking.

846
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,900
In fact, I suppose now with the debug camera, I should be able to

847
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,900
verify that though.

848
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,200
So here's the version where we're actually using kind of scattered

849
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500
stuff for the cubes, right?

850
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,200
And if I

851
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,800
reset it to just use this one and I should get

852
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,000
again, a screen with nothing.

853
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:47,500
If I look up, you would think I would see, but I still don't.

854
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,600
It's very strange.

855
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,800
So yeah as far as I can tell, we're definitely getting something odd

856
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,600
where it's like we pick the room below.

857
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,900
As you can see that the Z offset was pretty substantial.

858
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,400
The other one.

859
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,500
So we have to figure out what is going on there but I'd like to pause

860
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,400
that for a second to finish what we were doing with the cubes and then

861
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,700
go from there, you can kind of see here how I've got all these

862
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,600
traversable 's

863
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Rendering us, these little Jimmy.

864
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,700
Rendering us these little Cube shapes.

865
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,300
But I'm sorry rendering is the these little rectangles that are flat

866
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,300
but I want them to cubes.

867
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,900
And so what I should be able to do here.

868
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,700
Is change this from a push wrecked, which is what I was doing before.

869
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:11,900
Triple H Cube.

870
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,300
And while I'm at it.

871
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,200
I may get rid of the automatic outlining, we had

872
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,300
There we go.

873
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,700
So the push Cube function.

874
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,300
we need to pass the parameters to it that we specified from for and

875
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,000
those are

876
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:56,100
the group, the bitmap ID, which in this case

877
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,800
I guess, we'll just get.

878
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,700
From The Entity.

879
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,900
I'm not 100% certain how we were doing that.

880
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,500
I guess, he'd here, we had these Peace Index things.

881
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,700
And you can kind of see in here, we got this like piece count.

882
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,100
Right.

883
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,400
And then it looks fairly reasonable.

884
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,100
The question is, do we want to use the piece count in some way for

885
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,500
this?

886
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,900
If we look at the Envy visual piece, it's got a color and offset and

887
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:57,000
asset type the height and flags, it's probably more than me really

888
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:57,700
need.

889
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,400
So it seems like kind of Overkill in this case for something like

890
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:04,800
that.

891
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,100
So I don't know that we actually want that.

892
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,400
We probably want something a little more straightforward where we're

893
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,400
just specifying.

894
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,800
More of a an image here.

895
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,200
But I don't know.

896
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,200
So we could just say that, you know, if it's got a traversable like

897
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:23,600
this

898
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,300
I guess I'm just going to say, you know what, maybe we just get rid of

899
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,600
this and we say, sure.

900
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,600
Go into the Peace Index stuff that, you know, can do what it's going

901
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,200
to do.

902
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,800
We have the bitmap ID situation.

903
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,200
And we can then say, all right, instead of a pushpin map called

904
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:03,900
doesn't have to be pushed up that call if we want to, it can be peace

905
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:05,800
type, you know, Cube

906
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,100
and if it is a cube,

907
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,100
Then we'll just use some of this information to derive how big the

908
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:33,000
cube should be.

909
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:37,900
In this particular case we sort of have a situation where I guess

910
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,300
we're over specified.

911
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,000
You know we have this notion of the offset and maybe we can just use

912
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,600
the offset as the three values that we want.

913
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,600
And I guess we could make it so that the cube actually takes each

914
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,300
individual Dimension separately as well.

915
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,100
Since we if we are always passing that down and we don't really need

916
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,900
the height in this case for anything in particular.

917
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,300
There.

918
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,100
So I think we can just do

919
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,500
something more, like,

920
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,600
Well, I guess we do need the offset there.

921
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:18,000
Now that I think about it because we do we do actually need to say how

922
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,100
How its offset from The Entity potentially, so that's not actually

923
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:24,400
true.

924
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,600
So we do want that in there.

925
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,400
So we're going to have to figure out another way to pass that

926
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,000
information.

927
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,000
So we've got the height.

928
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:38,100
And I guess we need kind of a radius value here that we don't have,

929
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:38,900
right?

930
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,800
And of course color we do have

931
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,300
So that's a good question and I'm not sure exactly where I want to get

932
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,700
that information from.

933
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,700
It seems like that's something that just wants to be in there

934
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,200
separately, because you can see here, when you're passing that height

935
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,900
down with push bitmap, you know, that's the kind of thing that you

936
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,900
probably in the future want to be able to control separately, the both

937
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,200
of them.

938
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,400
So I feel like that's just something that in general, we would want

939
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,100
So I feel like we want something maybe more like that where that's

940
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,700
actually specified as a dimension.

941
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,100
And in this case, we could do, you know, height equals Jim one or

942
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,100
whatever dimmed out.

943
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:31,700
Why?

944
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,200
So when we do in it, when we do a bitmap, will use that.

945
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,000
And when we use

946
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,200
It in this case.

947
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:53,900
We passed it like that.

948
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,100
So then we're doing at peace and we specify a height like this that

949
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,900
would you know translate into something like this.

950
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,800
I don't know exactly what we want that to be, but something like this

951
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,700
and then if we're adding a cube, we would add it slightly differently,

952
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:15,900
right?

953
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,100
And we could have, you know,

954
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,800
This parameter could just be passed through, I suppose.

955
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:34,700
And then when people call AD piece, in this case, you know, they

956
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,900
would, they would pass the V2 course, there's so many people that call

957
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,300
that I feel like we want to keep it the way it is.

958
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,400
So I feel like I want one of these that does do that translation for

959
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:46,700
you.

960
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,100
And it's literally just a thunk.

961
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:58,700
Does nothing.

962
01:05:58,700 --> 01:05:59,800
But wrap it for you.

963
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,800
so, I think

964
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,100
I think that's reasonable and that way we can have cubes that are kind

965
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:20,000
of mixed in here with everything else as part of an empty, anytime we

966
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,400
want.

967
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,600
And that seems good.

968
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,400
The cube render Cube call.

969
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,000
I do feel like maybe taking the height as the second thing makes a

970
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,200
little more sense there.

971
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,400
So we'll maybe leave it like that but otherwise I think we're good.

972
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:46,300
So we run this now and you know we took out those those perfect calls

973
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,200
so those are gone but now you know we can verify at least that

974
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,900
everything else is working just fine.

975
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,100
And all we need to do now is actually put in some for of the things

976
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,700
that have traversable is like those ground points.

977
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,400
We just need to give them individual pieces that they can actually

978
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:05,200
We work with.

979
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So if I go to the world mode, where we create this,

980
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,000
Inside a standard room.

981
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:20,200
We've got these places where we're making these entities, right?

982
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,600
With floor collision and in here, they just they never have any actual

983
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,900
pieces to them.

984
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:30,500
So all we really need to do to finish that off, is we just need to

985
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:34,100
actually add a piece and

986
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,000
If we take a look at how we call this, we just need the entity.

987
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,200
We're trying to add the piece too.

988
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,000
We need the asset type.

989
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,600
which in this case,

990
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:22,899
There we go.

991
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,000
In this case.

992
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,300
I'm not sure what we're actually adding here, but, you know,

993
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:37,399
I guess maybe rock or stone.

994
01:08:37,399 --> 01:08:41,000
We need to actually put in some real art soon because now this stuff

995
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,100
is going to make any sense.

996
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:50,000
Unless we do but, you know, all right, so maybe there's maybe there's

997
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,500
grass.

998
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:14,800
There we go.

999
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,800
So the asset type, in this case, we'll just put something in there

1000
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,700
random for the moment, we need the height and the radius here.

1001
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:30,500
And in this case, since we have in the entity, we kind of know what we

1002
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,399
were doing with that before.

1003
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:39,200
Just because we happen to have it here, it was 14 for the radius for

1004
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,600
whatever reason for the height.

1005
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,700
I don't know what we want.

1006
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:47,399
Probably like, you know, three, we want these to be fairly tall.

1007
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,000
Maybe not, maybe just one meter is fine, who knows?

1008
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,700
and then,

1009
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
We need the offset, the color, and the flags.

1010
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,000
So the offset in this case is actually it's a little tricky because

1011
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,300
I know I said before I was like well we'll just make it the top of the

1012
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:15,900
cube.

1013
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,000
But now that I think about it, it's like if we're going to allow this

1014
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,400
to be sort of a general thing where entities can just have Cube pieces

1015
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:28,300
to them if they want, that makes it probably a little more compelling

1016
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,900
for us to make it be the center of the cube.

1017
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:31,600
Probably.

1018
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,500
I don't actually know that that's true.

1019
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:38,100
It may actually still make more sense for it to be pivoted at the top

1020
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,000
because, you know, if you imagine it was sort of like an appendage or

1021
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,600
stuck to something that make more sense.

1022
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,500
So I'm not sure that's a really tough question as to how

1023
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,100
It should be constructed.

1024
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,700
As to whether it should be centered or not.

1025
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,300
And so,

1026
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,300
I guess I'll leave it with top for now and maybe we'll live to regret

1027
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,200
that quite a bit.

1028
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,400
It's really hard to say.

1029
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So let's find out.

1030
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,000
Offset in this case, we'll just be 3000.

1031
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,800
The color can just be white for now, really do anything with that and

1032
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,000
the flags can be like peace type Cube.

1033
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:24,100
Then off you go.

1034
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:32,100
So the piece type Cube situation is now in theory, in full effect, it

1035
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,900
should get actually execute upon and so my assumption is now we'll get

1036
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,700
in assertion in the renderer hopefully.

1037
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,200
Yes, which tells us that.

1038
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,000
Now we're actually getting cubes seen down in the render it.

1039
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,500
So we just need to have the cube primitive.

1040
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Be something that actually is understood by the opengl renderer which

1041
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,800
in this case we can do, we're not going to do anything fancy.

1042
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,700
We're just going to do very, very basic.

1043
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,600
And we'll base it here on.

1044
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:03,100
We go.

1045
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,900
I honor render entry bitmap.

1046
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,700
So, okay.

1047
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,200
We've got our render entry cubed here.

1048
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,700
And that's really it.

1049
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,500
And oops.

1050
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,400
We then need to actually output this Cube.

1051
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,600
We're going to go ahead and bind the texture.

1052
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:43,200
And then we need to do essentially the same thing as we were doing up

1053
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:43,600
there.

1054
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,200
But with a little more

1055
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,200
I guess I should say a little less fussing because we don't have to do

1056
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,900
as much work in this particular case.

1057
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:03,000
So what we want to do now is output the triangles of the cube, we

1058
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,600
could do this with a little more finesse.

1059
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,300
then we're about to, but

1060
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,200
Maybe start somewhere.

1061
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,000
So

1062
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,600
Here's mr.

1063
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,100
Cube

1064
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,900
and we just need to generate some points and triangles that will

1065
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,100
Define this Cube soap in jail can draw it, right?

1066
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,100
And we know we've got eight vertices in a cube.

1067
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:07,500
Right.

1068
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,900
Eight corners of the cube.

1069
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,600
And we know that every side of the cube is a face.

1070
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,200
There are six phases and each face has 2 triangles in it, right?

1071
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,100
Because each square has 2 triangles

1072
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,400
So, if we want to, we can imagine creating this pretty

1073
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,700
straightforwardly, right?

1074
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:33,800
We just need to talk about these points in terms of the axes that

1075
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,800
we're thinking of here.

1076
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,400
And so, you know, you can imagine.

1077
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Here's my y.

1078
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,300
Here's my X.

1079
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:45,200
Here is my Z same, as we normally draw, and we've got each of these.

1080
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,600
These are sort of the positive Z ones.

1081
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,600
These are the negative Z one's right.

1082
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,300
The positive y ones would be up here.

1083
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,800
Of why ones down here.

1084
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,100
Positive X here, Negative X over here, right?

1085
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,400
So we can kind of think about those all of those things, all of these

1086
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,700
Corners essentially in that way, right?

1087
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,000
This

1088
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:11,700
Corner.

1089
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,900
Right here is negative X, right?

1090
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:19,000
Positive y - Z.

1091
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:19,700
I'm sorry.

1092
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,400
Positive Z.

1093
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,400
Right.

1094
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,300
So in fact, if I just labeled them Negative, X positive, y, negative,

1095
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:38,100
Z this is - x - y - Z, sorry positive Z.

1096
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:39,900
And then why keep lying like that positive Z?

1097
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:45,300
This is positive x - y positive Z.

1098
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,000
This is positive x - y.

1099
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,300
- Z.

1100
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,000
This is positive.

1101
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,600
X positive, y negative.

1102
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,400
Z, this is negative X positive.

1103
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,100
Y, negative Z.

1104
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,100
This is negative X.

1105
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,600
- y - Z.

1106
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,800
And now we've got all the different points.

1107
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,100
So if we want to create each of these individual faces, oops, forgot

1108
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:13,700
one here.

1109
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,600
This is positive X.

1110
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,100
Positive, why?

1111
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:20,900
- Z.

1112
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,600
Positively rather.

1113
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:32,600
So if I have all these points, now I can just think about actually

1114
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,400
just putting in what the cubes should be, just manually.

1115
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,800
It's pretty easy, right?

1116
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,700
You could imagine saying, all right, I've got a bunch of points.

1117
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:48,100
Let's say here in three dimensions and maybe I use like lower case for

1118
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:51,400
- and uppercase for positive.

1119
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,800
So, you know, I'd have XYZ

1120
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,100
XYZ.

1121
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,700
XYZ.

1122
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,600
Right?

1123
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,300
And in fact, I guess, I could do this a little more systematically may

1124
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:09,400
be very easy.

1125
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,500
Each time it's a little hard to see.

1126
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,400
I don't know how good of an idea that actually is wish the Z's were a

1127
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,900
little bit more clear in this font, but they're not.

1128
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:30,600
So you can see here, I've got the Z lowercase.

1129
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,000
So I've got negative, Z positive Z, then the Y goes positive, negative

1130
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Z positive Z.

1131
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,900
Now, let's go make the X+ same thing.

1132
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,000
And there's all my eight cases, right?

1133
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,600
Since that's a little hard to see.

1134
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,300
I don't know.

1135
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,900
I think that's maybe not such a good idea.

1136
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,900
So here's another way I could do it.

1137
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,800
I could do like, you know, PA

1138
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:07,800
Py pz and like, an X and Y and Z or something like that.

1139
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:08,400
Right?

1140
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,600
Is a little easier to see.

1141
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,800
so, if I'm going to do it that way,

1142
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,300
I bet - C+ Z.

1143
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,100
And then I've got the positive y versions of those too.

1144
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:33,400
And then we just make the positive X versions of all of those.

1145
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,700
So that seems reasonable enough I suppose, right?

1146
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,300
And so, all these are going to be is they're just bundles of the

1147
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,000
values.

1148
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,600
And I could literally bundle these values exactly as they are written,

1149
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,100
right?

1150
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,500
So it can just be

1151
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,300
this sort of thing.

1152
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,500
I suppose now I think about it, if I want to I could just use the

1153
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,100
opengl immediate for this even.

1154
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,800
Why can I not do that?

1155
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,800
So, I can just specify the - see the positive x - x to the positive x

1156
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,000
negative y, the positive wire the negative, to the positive Z.

1157
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,400
And then in here,

1158
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,900
I can just do.

1159
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,700
This sort of thing.

1160
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:48,400
All right.

1161
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:56,500
So what we will see a lot is if I want to do this and in specifying a

1162
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:03,100
GL triangle in order to specify the face of a cube, I'm going to have

1163
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,900
to do something like this.

1164
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:17,900
If I've got point zero, one, two, three, and I want to draw a quad.

1165
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,800
What I have to do is I have to specify one triangle that is 012,

1166
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,400
right?

1167
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,900
This triangle right here.

1168
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And then I will have to spend another three vertices to specify

1169
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
another triangle zero to three

1170
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,100
rather than type that out.

1171
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:47,400
I will just make a utility function for that.

1172
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,400
I don't have one already.

1173
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,300
I don't think I do.

1174
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Yeah.

1175
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:52,700
So

1176
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,500
You can see here, we have opengl rectangle, which is basically the

1177
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,800
function that we want.

1178
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,200
Problem is that the function itself has this kind of nasty habit of

1179
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:11,800
specifying the begin as part of it, which we don't really want, but

1180
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,300
this is mostly what we want.

1181
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,600
So I can make another one, which is just like,

1182
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,300
GL quad.

1183
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,500
And in this case, I can go ahead and and

1184
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,800
I can go ahead and be a little more specific here but we're specifying

1185
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,100
in terms of

1186
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,600
In terms of the points as well, because you can see here that it was

1187
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,700
not actually giving me the freedom specify these points because it's

1188
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,500
assuming The Main PX and py that sort of thing.

1189
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:55,900
So I guess in a sense, this wasn't really exactly what I wanted.

1190
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:57,300
But what do you do?

1191
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,800
All right, so I'm going to have a GL quad call here.

1192
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,600
I'm going to be able to pass it a female color.

1193
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,400
I think what I actually want to do probably is say, you know, I've got

1194
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,900
P0 which is you know the point out the bottom there I've got the

1195
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,400
texture coordinates for it and I've got the color for it.

1196
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:19,100
Let's say so I can pass all four of I mean all three of those in and I

1197
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,800
just passed four of those.

1198
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,100
So it's all of the, the actual information that I need we'll just be

1199
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,800
over explicit there and we can always simplify it later.

1200
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:34,200
so in this case now I know what I want to do is I want to specify like

1201
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:40,500
field color 4fv and I'm going to pass that color zero and I'm going to

1202
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:44,300
specify the texture coordinate and I'm going to specify

1203
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,300
The point as well.

1204
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,800
So that's an example of how to specify one point.

1205
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,100
We just for the color, the texture coordinates and the vertex data.

1206
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,200
And like I said I want to do 0 1, 2 and 0 to 3.

1207
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:05,600
So there's 0 1 2.

1208
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,300
And zero.

1209
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:20,500
23.

1210
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,200
And you'll notice that when I did this, I was careful to always keep

1211
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,800
these wound the same direction so you can look and see.

1212
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,400
I've got, I said 012 that's wound counterclockwise relative to the

1213
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,500
facing Direction and the same is true here, 0 to 3 again wound

1214
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,100
counterclockwise, and the reason that I wound them both in the same

1215
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,000
direction that way.

1216
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,800
And also both counterclockwise is just because if we ever want to use

1217
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,900
back, face culling, right?

1218
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,800
Backface culling is a concept that just indicates that.

1219
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,500
Hey, if I'm looking at a closed object, right?

1220
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:58,900
Like, let's say, I'm looking at this fear, I'm sorry, this fear this

1221
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,900
Cube that we're talking.

1222
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,200
About the one we're actually building.

1223
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,000
Well, it's closed.

1224
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,700
You know, there's no holes in it.

1225
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,200
There isn't like a hole in the top.

1226
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,100
I can use to see into the inside and what that means is that you can

1227
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,400
only ever see the front of the faces of the cube.

1228
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,200
Right.

1229
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:18,400
You'll never see the backs of the faces of the cues because if you

1230
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,100
turn the cube around, you'll just see the other side of a cube, you

1231
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,600
won't see the other side of one of these faces.

1232
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:28,100
You'll see the other face of the cube that's on the corresponding

1233
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,400
opposite side.

1234
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,200
So given that what it means is that the hardware, the gravis Hardware

1235
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:39,100
can actually early out anytime it does a transform and finds that the

1236
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:43,500
points for a given face are wound in the incorrect order relative to

1237
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:46,800
the screen because what it knows is that if you always specify them

1238
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,500
wound up particular way, you know, if I always specify zero one two,

1239
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,600
And they're always around in that that counter clockwise fashion.

1240
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,600
Then what it knows is if this Q Bert is spin around such that.

1241
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,900
Now this face, you know,

1242
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,000
Is my Cube again such that.

1243
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,300
Now, this face is actually in the back here, right?

1244
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,100
It's one of the back faces of the cube.

1245
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:14,700
So it can't actually be visible because we know we can never see that.

1246
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,600
It's a closed object would never see in there.

1247
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,600
It's not possible.

1248
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,700
We know we can eliminate that, that face right away.

1249
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,400
Because look what happens.

1250
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,100
This is zero point is now here, right?

1251
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,600
This one point is now over here.

1252
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,500
And this to point is up here and what you'll notice is 012, it's now

1253
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,300
wounded the other way, right?

1254
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:42,300
And that's exactly what happens as you spin something around as it

1255
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,700
flips, as it goes from being front-facing, to you as facing you to

1256
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,000
being back facing to you.

1257
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:52,800
It flips its orientation and so I was careful to wind them that way,

1258
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,200
so that if we want to turn something like that on, we can.

1259
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,200
And so, you know, that was sort of a little something that was

1260
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,100
implicit in what I do.

1261
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,600
But that is why I did that.

1262
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,800
It wasn't arbitrary, it was intentional.

1263
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,900
Just so that's clear.

1264
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,300
So, if we take a look at the cube situation here and now, and I come

1265
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,800
Through and put in this, this GL quad situation here.

1266
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:24,400
So what I can probably say is if I use this thing and now I'm back to

1267
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,300
what I was thinking about before to where I actually do need to pack

1268
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:27,800
them in.

1269
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,400
But anyway, so if I go through my GL quad here, what I'm going to need

1270
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:37,200
to do is I'm going to need to specify all the faces of this Cube here,

1271
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:37,900
right?

1272
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,100
Every last one of them.

1273
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,300
And so, you know, I'm going to want to specify

1274
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,400
Item in this way.

1275
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,600
So here is one face like that.

1276
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,100
Let's see what it is.

1277
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:56,600
It's going to be a positive X, right?

1278
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,800
Positive x - y.

1279
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,900
Positive Z, and the next one's going to be.

1280
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,900
Positive x - y - Z.

1281
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:16,700
Next one's going to be positive, X positive, y, negative Z and the

1282
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:20,700
last one is going to be all positive, positive X, positive y, positive

1283
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,400
Z, and then the same thing is true.

1284
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:30,000
For all of these.

1285
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,400
I guess it's also now.

1286
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:38,200
I think about it.

1287
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,900
I wonder if I just want to do it.

1288
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:50,000
A little simpler to say, okay, if itís do 0, 1, 2 3.

1289
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,300
So as I didn't see, it might be a little clearer.

1290
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,700
So let's say

1291
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,500
0 1, 2 3.

1292
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:05,000
Four, five, six, seven.

1293
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:06,700
Something like that.

1294
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:11,400
So let's try that again because again that's I think that's going to

1295
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,600
be a little simpler for us.

1296
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,200
So, if we do this deal quad here and I want to do, let's say this

1297
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,400
front face right here.

1298
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,900
That's just 0 1, 2 3.

1299
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,300
Then this is the entire code for that.

1300
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,800
If I wanted to do the back face, it be four, five, six seven, right?

1301
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:41,300
But again, I want it to be facing the correct direction.

1302
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,400
So rather than four, five, six, seven, it would actually go the other

1303
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,500
way round, right?

1304
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:50,300
It be four seven six, five or seven, six five four, right?

1305
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,400
Because it needs to be wound counterclockwise relative to somebody

1306
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,900
looking from the back.

1307
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,900
That makes sense.

1308
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,700
So 76-54 is really what that should look like.

1309
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,400
And we do have a little bit of a concern here, too.

1310
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:22,400
With the texture coordinates, these are not really going to be correct

1311
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,600
because we're going to want probably different texture, coordinates in

1312
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,000
a lot of cases for these.

1313
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:32,000
So that's a little bit harder to Envision.

1314
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:37,100
In fact, for the time being, I might actually leave these as just

1315
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:38,200
always this way.

1316
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,900
And we'll play with those later, I think.

1317
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,900
So, I'm just going to focus on just the positions instead.

1318
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,100
So now, I've got this face, right?

1319
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,700
I've got this front face and this back face, and I need to do these

1320
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,800
ones around the side.

1321
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:58,800
Let's do the ones the bottom and top faces next.

1322
01:29:59,500 --> 01:29:59,800
So the

1323
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,300
I'm face is just 0 15 for right.

1324
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:07,300
But again that would be if it was facing us, it's not, it's facing

1325
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:07,700
your way.

1326
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:11,100
So I need to do it the opposite direction, right?

1327
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,500
So that's going to be for 510, right?

1328
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,800
It's going to be wounded this way, so that when we're looking at it

1329
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,400
from here, it'll be counterclockwise, right?

1330
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:29,800
So we want it clockwise to us basically, 4510 we

1331
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,600
Then want the top face to be wound the way we would expect.

1332
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:38,100
So 2673 right, would be the correct whining for that.

1333
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,700
And in addition to 2673 and those two, we need these final two phases

1334
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:55,000
here which are these guys.

1335
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,400
So that's the one we originally started with 1562.

1336
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,400
And then finally, the back one again, it would be zero, four, seven

1337
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,000
three, but we're not going in that order because it's facing the other

1338
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,500
direction.

1339
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,200
So it's actually going to be 7403.

1340
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:23,100
And that's actually all of the faces of the cube.

1341
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,900
So what we need to do now and I guess I probably want to leave those

1342
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,400
in place.

1343
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,900
There is, I want to create these actual things.

1344
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:42,000
So I'm going to for the time being actually just have the color, be

1345
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,700
the color

1346
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,800
Although you know what to make it easier for us to see to maybe, I'll

1347
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,700
just do this.

1348
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:18,500
So that way, we'll be able to see the corners of the cubes very nicely

1349
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,100
before we start playing around with any other information about them

1350
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:23,700
for these.

1351
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:27,300
I'll just set them something.

1352
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,700
Pretty basic, and we'll leave it at that.

1353
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,500
The other thing we can do here, if we want to is we could turn off

1354
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,700
texturing, just for these.

1355
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,300
So we could see them a little bit better.

1356
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,200
I don't know if we have any particular.

1357
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,800
I don't know if we have anything particularly useful.

1358
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,100
For textures that we would really apply here.

1359
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,000
so, what I might do is just say

1360
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,700
Let's just turn that off temporarily so we can see our Cube and we'll

1361
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:07,800
deal with the rest of it later.

1362
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:12,100
Alright, so we have some more work to do here.

1363
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:13,900
Obviously we have much of the work to do here.

1364
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,900
I guess these just want me to hand, hold it.

1365
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:26,600
So it knows how to find the text the float in there.

1366
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,400
That's fine.

1367
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:29,500
Yeah.

1368
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,900
and so, if we take a look at this here, we've got these

1369
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,900
These Cube points and we just need to generate what they actually are.

1370
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,700
So in order to generate the cube points,

1371
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,800
I'm just going to go with what we correspond in the diagram.

1372
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:17,500
And so you can see zero is negative negative positive for whatever

1373
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,000
reason.

1374
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,000
That's what we did.

1375
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:24,700
Not sure why positive negative positive is one.

1376
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:31,800
Two is all positive.

1377
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:37,500
And three is.

1378
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,500
Negative positive positive.

1379
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,400
We then did the exact same thing on the back.

1380
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,400
So 4 is negative negative negative.

1381
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And then we did positive negative, negative and positive positive

1382
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:53,600
negative.

1383
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,300
So those are our points.

1384
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,100
And all we really need to know.

1385
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:05,100
Now is what those sort of positions, actually.

1386
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:09,700
We're and so, if we take a look at how our Cuba specified, right?

1387
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:17,200
We have our Cube p and obviously, the exes.

1388
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:21,000
We'll start with that, which is the centered and then they're just

1389
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,800
going to subtract or add the radius.

1390
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,200
Oops.

1391
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,600
And the same would be true of the, why?

1392
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,200
so, again, just subtracting it or adding the radius

1393
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:52,500
Finally, the Z is a little bit different in this case, instead of

1394
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:57,100
subtracting adding anything, we were saying, we were going to have the

1395
01:35:57,100 --> 01:35:59,500
top, which is the most positive part.

1396
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:04,100
Be at zero and then we're going to have the height.

1397
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:09,600
So to get the - the minimum value, we have to do a subtraction app but

1398
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,400
those are all of them.

1399
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,600
So now in theory we were actually drawing cubes.

1400
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:18,200
I mean, assuming that we didn't screw something up and they're not

1401
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,000
going to be pretty right there.

1402
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,700
Going to be real ugly and you can see that they're actually really

1403
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:28,700
ugly, they're there is our Cube and everything looks good about this

1404
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,400
except for the fact that they're all in the same place with.

1405
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:35,700
So we must not be setting the offset of our Cube properly.

1406
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:40,100
So I got to go double-check that but otherwise you can see our cube is

1407
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,000
kind of what we wanted it to be.

1408
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,200
And so,

1409
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,500
It's good, you know, yay for our Cube.

1410
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,100
That's all fine and dandy.

1411
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,900
So, let's go ahead and take a look.

1412
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,600
I think that we just when we were specifying the pieces here, right?

1413
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,500
We specify the offset is 0.

1414
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:03,800
0 0, I think we never actually in entity offset that by the

1415
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,500
traversable position, or whatever.

1416
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,200
It was that we were trying to do there.

1417
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,000
I don't think we actually managed to do so in push queues.

1418
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yeah, we just passed the piece offset and we didn't use the entity

1419
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,200
transform at all.

1420
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,500
So the edit transform, in this case.

1421
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,600
We want that offset to be baked in there, right?

1422
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,600
So now we've got all our cubes, I don't know.

1423
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,300
Since we're subtracting the radius, I guess the rectangle was a

1424
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,400
straight Dimension.

1425
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,600
So the fact that we are we're using this as a radius.

1426
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
Now we would have to have the value.

1427
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:49,200
So our cubes are too big but otherwise our cubes are correct.

1428
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,800
Looks like for the most part.

1429
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,900
That looks pretty much right to me and those look like they're drawing

1430
01:37:56,900 --> 01:37:57,700
in the right place.

1431
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,400
And so all of our cubes are kind of happy and that's all good.

1432
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,400
But obviously we still have the problem that I was talking about

1433
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,300
before which I need, well, we got a couple different problems.

1434
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,100
One is now, we have to deal with how our stuff intersex or does

1435
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,500
intersect as the case may be.

1436
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,000
So we're going to have to take a look at that.

1437
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,700
But like, you can see, for example, this tree here, and this Cube and

1438
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,100
how they interrelate

1439
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,300
That's going to be kind of a problem for us and we're going to have

1440
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,700
to, you know, have a sane solution for how we're doing with that

1441
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,100
stuff.

1442
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:34,500
Like probably what we want in most cases is we want Sprites for things

1443
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:39,600
like trees to, you know, always be in front if they started in front,

1444
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,600
you know, and we don't really want to deal with the interpenetration

1445
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,000
right.

1446
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,400
But you can see with how these things are lying.

1447
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,300
And again, you can see why I wanted the debug camera stuff, you can

1448
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:51,000
see with how flat those are lying.

1449
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,800
We just have this problem with how they're going to

1450
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,900
date with each other is going to cause problems for us.

1451
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:58,300
And so that's just something that we're going to have to deal with.

1452
01:38:59,700 --> 01:38:59,800
Oh,

1453
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,200
It's so let's just take care of some, some house keys being here.

1454
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,500
we have some time left in the Stream, although I don't know how much

1455
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,200
started at 10:30.

1456
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,400
Right.

1457
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,900
So we'll be done at 12:30.

1458
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:27,000
I think we have about 15 minutes left so we got some more stuff.

1459
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:27,800
We probably want to do.

1460
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,200
Okay, so taking a look at this.

1461
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,700
For example, first of all, we could try to find that bug because we

1462
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,600
know we have a bug with the way that the world rooms are working.

1463
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,200
That might be a little bit too much to start to the with your now.

1464
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:44,700
So, for the moment, I'm going to ignore that guy and we will tackle

1465
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:48,100
him probably tomorrow, I think would be the best time to take a look

1466
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:48,600
at that one.

1467
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,500
To do instead, here is just say, okay, what I can do is I can reduce

1468
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:57,600
the variance of some of these to produce a more reasonable set of

1469
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,600
ground positions.

1470
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,800
Like so, which is a little more indicative of probably what we would

1471
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,400
be doing in the game anyway.

1472
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:07,900
Here is, you know, the hero will have the hero kind of come down the

1473
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:08,500
screen here.

1474
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:09,800
Well, that was very strange.

1475
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,200
I think this monitor is getting confused with, I don't think I'm

1476
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,400
varying anything.

1477
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,200
Maybe I am

1478
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,600
That's very strange.

1479
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:28,200
All right anyway.

1480
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,600
So this is yeah this is more or less.

1481
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:38,300
What I wanted you can tell though it's going to get pretty rough in

1482
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:38,600
here.

1483
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:41,600
If this is actually how we were drawing all of our cubes in this weird

1484
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,000
psychedelic crazy way so we probably don't want to be doing that at

1485
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,500
the moment, even just for to buy produce this.

1486
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:51,100
So now that I know that are cubes are correct.

1487
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:54,200
I'm going to go ahead and and switch to drawing these cubes and

1488
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:57,600
Slightly more sensible, in terms of their colors.

1489
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,900
Something that we can actually use.

1490
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:05,300
So, if I come in here and set the colors to something that actually is

1491
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,000
representative.

1492
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,100
So, here's the cube Colour itself,

1493
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:19,100
and if we set the thing to the cube color,

1494
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,900
sorry, Primo color.

1495
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:31,600
We should be able to.

1496
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,100
Get sort of something that's that's going to be a little more stable

1497
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:40,700
for us here.

1498
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:46,600
So, first off, if we set a texture on it like I said, I don't know

1499
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,500
that we have any textures.

1500
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:51,500
I'll try to find one here that I can use as a starting point.

1501
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:55,100
But I don't know.

1502
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:56,300
It's going to work particularly well.

1503
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,300
Let's go ahead and start that off so you can see like that's now each

1504
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:09,300
face of the cube has one of those little dudes, one of those little

1505
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,400
grasses on it.

1506
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,100
Unfortunately, all of those were made when I thought, you know, those

1507
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:17,300
are just some test textures that we threw in there that were made when

1508
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:20,800
I thought we were going to do stamping and I don't really want to do

1509
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,200
stamp anymore because the point was to make things more much more Cube

1510
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:28,300
like and so we kind of need some way of making those.

1511
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:29,900
We need something that's going to

1512
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,700
be more usable there.

1513
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:33,700
I don't know that we have anything at the moment.

1514
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:36,000
We should probably update to the new our pack.

1515
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,900
I guess that's something that we probably should do soon.

1516
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:40,000
Just so we have the right stuff to play with here.

1517
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,700
I'll have to go talk to an about that.

1518
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,200
And get the latest effort / so we can do that.

1519
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:49,800
But is there anywhere to go?

1520
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:51,500
Here I go.

1521
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,200
Out of here.

1522
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:07,300
But otherwise that should be okay, the thing about it is again, we

1523
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,500
probably want some way to do some lighting there which we don't have

1524
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,400
at the moment.

1525
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:15,400
We really don't have any way of distinguishing those.

1526
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,800
So we all sort of have this problem of wanting to be able to specify

1527
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,900
some of those Cube colors.

1528
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:25,400
A little more independently so that we can have them sort of reflect

1529
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:29,800
their where they are roughly and how they should be colored

1530
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:30,400
differently.

1531
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:31,700
So there is a little bit

1532
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:32,600
That.

1533
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:39,700
So, I have to think about how we want to deal with that.

1534
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,500
Oh and here you can see, this is the case I was talking about so good.

1535
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,600
Let's go ahead and get in there.

1536
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:51,100
So this was the case that I was talking about that.

1537
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:55,400
I wanted to have sort of a an answer for you.

1538
01:43:55,400 --> 01:44:00,700
Can see here there's this Cube and it's a little obviously difficult

1539
01:44:00,700 --> 01:44:04,000
because wonder if there's any what if we have anything at all?

1540
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,600
That's an asset we could use in that location.

1541
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,500
That would be more just want a flat lie.

1542
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:12,100
Grass texture.

1543
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,600
That doesn't have soft edges.

1544
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,300
I just don't know if we had one in that pack.

1545
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:17,300
I don't think we did.

1546
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,600
Yeah, I really just don't think we did.

1547
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:33,000
I'll try a couple things here to see if there's anything.

1548
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:49,500
I could try some things and see, I don't think there is

1549
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:01,700
Oh God.

1550
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,000
Yeah.

1551
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,100
I think we are.

1552
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,400
SOL my friends.

1553
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:44,000
so yeah, I guess I couldn't say

1554
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:54,000
I guess I'm going to leave that till we have something better for it,

1555
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,100
but all I'm trying to all I was trying to point out as you can see

1556
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:02,200
here that you've got a cube and the tree is sticking directly into the

1557
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:03,100
cube, right?

1558
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:05,900
And so, when you view it from above, you're going to get that

1559
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:06,400
artifact.

1560
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:10,700
Now, that artifact is not necessarily an incorrect artifact in certain

1561
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:10,900
senses.

1562
01:46:10,900 --> 01:46:14,400
Meaning, you know, we're again because we are still a 2-D game.

1563
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,500
I'm just using some 3D rendering to, give us some nice effects, and

1564
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:20,200
some better performance than what we would have.

1565
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:23,600
If we had to do Sprites sorting and stuff like that, that I wasn't

1566
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:24,200
happy with.

1567
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:27,600
So it's not necessarily that that's wrong.

1568
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:31,500
It's just that you know, when we're creating this world that doesn't

1569
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:32,300
quite exist, right?

1570
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:37,100
Because we've drawn 2D assets, but we're using them in a 3D way to

1571
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,900
produce a 3D sort of effect.

1572
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:41,500
You do have to sort of figure out how you're going to account for the

1573
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:46,000
fact that sometimes you will end up with 3D problems with that 2D

1574
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,200
fakery and you need a way around them.

1575
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,000
And so that's what I was talking about in the

1576
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,500
And we're because these things actually are leaning like this.

1577
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:57,300
When you look at them from the side, they can interpenetrate with

1578
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:03,300
relatively low stacked, things behind them, and that's bad, right?

1579
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:12,300
so what we need to do there is we need to have some sort of a

1580
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,300
A way to combat that.

1581
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,900
And that's why I think one of the things that we probably want to do

1582
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:26,600
is is have that sort of fake Z, so that things that are upright cards

1583
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:31,400
get fake Z buffer values to allow them to sort differently than they

1584
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:35,100
would otherwise and I don't know again like I said if that's a good or

1585
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,100
bad idea but it seems like the right idea.

1586
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,500
For the time being we're about out of time.

1587
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:47,200
So I will go ahead and go to the Q&A for now, but that's roughly what

1588
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,300
I wanted there.

1589
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,800
So I think we're good.

1590
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,100
We need to do.

1591
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:52,200
Oh.

1592
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,200
Well, you know what, in the five minutes what I can do to though, I

1593
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,900
can also go into our Sprite code and re-enable the

1594
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,500
Because that's really easy for us to do now.

1595
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:09,500
So, you know, right now you can see our hero is not cheering or doing

1596
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:12,600
any of those sort of things that you see L do.

1597
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:16,200
The reason for that is because inside the render group, when we're

1598
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,800
pushing down these axes, we're just using the camera action camera,

1599
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,700
why directly?

1600
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:25,300
And we're not ever using the x-axis y-axis that were actually getting

1601
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:30,000
past here but what we can do pretty easily there is we can

1602
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:36,000
Defy the code that we were placing here?

1603
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:43,200
So we get our x axis Y axis, we can actually produce those axes by

1604
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,500
doing the, by reinterpreting long, the cameras X and Y axis itself,

1605
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,100
right?

1606
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,900
So we know, for example, the x axis is X is talking about something

1607
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:57,300
that goes along the camera x-axis, and we know that the x axis Y is

1608
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:59,300
now something that goes along cameras y-axis.

1609
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:05,300
So we can actually reproduce what those axes those rotated Axis or

1610
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,100
sheared axes depending on what we got.

1611
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:10,200
Last weekend just reproduce what they would have been in the camera

1612
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:14,300
plane by using the cameras, two basis, vectors for that purpose and

1613
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,600
then you can see that we re enable the shearing that we wanted exactly

1614
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,400
like it used to be in 2D.

1615
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,700
It's now in 3D in that plane of the camera, right?

1616
01:49:28,700 --> 01:49:31,000
And that's exactly what we wanted.

1617
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:39,300
So again getting closer to a regular 3D version of the world here and

1618
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:43,900
you know, when we go ahead and fix Alpha and get some real bitmaps in

1619
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:51,100
there, we're getting very close to a proper, you know, a prepper thing

1620
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:56,000
that you could actually show someone and say here is, you know, a

1621
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,500
reasonable looking screen.

1622
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,100
We do have quite quite a few little things to take care of before we

1623
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:02,000
get there, right?

1624
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
All right, so let me go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1625
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:29,400
Mansfield asked any particular reason for using counterclockwise for

1626
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,500
front faces as opposed to clockwise at?

1627
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,900
No, not really.

1628
01:51:33,300 --> 01:51:35,200
So, the choice is arbitrary.

1629
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:43,500
And in fact, not only is the choice arbitrary, but you can also pick

1630
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,000
this.

1631
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,500
So, you know, 3D apis and graphics cards.

1632
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,500
Let you determine which faces are called in which faces are drawn,

1633
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:53,300
whether you want counterclockwise faces drawn or clockwise faces

1634
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:53,700
drawn.

1635
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:58,500
The choice is purely arbitrary and up to the programmer in all

1636
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,600
practical senses.

1637
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,100
As to why it is typically used as counterclockwise in modern circles.

1638
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,400
The reason is, you know, math.

1639
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,700
And so I talked about the concept of right-handed coordinate system.

1640
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,500
And a right-handed coordinate system.

1641
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:28,900
Again is one where if I was to draw the coordinate system and I was to

1642
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:37,300
take my hand and put my fingers so that they curl from X to y.

1643
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:39,800
Right?

1644
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,100
And I look at what direction.

1645
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,900
My thumb sticks out.

1646
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:43,600
That's my thumb.

1647
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:44,400
Apparently.

1648
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,000
My thumb sticks out along the z-axis.

1649
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:52,700
Right.

1650
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:59,800
So if you take a look at at just that, you know, right-handed curl,

1651
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,500
it's a right hand.

1652
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:05,100
If you take a right hand, you curl it from X to Y and their thumb

1653
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,100
points out along Z.

1654
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:09,500
That's a concept of a right-handed coordinate system for whatever

1655
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:14,500
reason, the majority of math favors, right handed coordinate systems.

1656
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,800
It favors coordinate systems where Y is up

1657
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:25,700
And access to the side and Z comes out at you right comes out of the

1658
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,700
page of the math book, if you will and that is the right handed

1659
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:30,600
coordinate system.

1660
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,600
The cross product is and geometric, algebra is typically written in

1661
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:36,500
right-hand terms.

1662
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,200
So, when you're talking about things like sheets and you have vectors

1663
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:43,600
that point out of the sheets, it's usually right handed in that the

1664
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,400
winding of these sheets is that way and the thing goes out that way.

1665
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:48,500
So,

1666
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:53,600
the reason that we tend to order vertices counterclockwise is just

1667
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:58,100
because if you tend to be favoring right-handed, as your standard for

1668
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,400
how you're doing math,

1669
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,400
You think of a face?

1670
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,100
As if you were to curl your fingers in, counterclockwise your thumb

1671
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:14,600
points out in the direction, the face is facing.

1672
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:21,200
And so again that's another just example of right-handedness there.

1673
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,500
And just to be clear, this has nothing to do with actually being

1674
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:29,700
left-handed or right-handed because it doesn't matter what your

1675
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:30,700
dominant hand is.

1676
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,600
Obviously you can curl either one.

1677
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,000
So a left-handed or right-handed person.

1678
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,400
No one is that it it wasn't like the mathematicians got together and

1679
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,800
decided they liked it right handed people better than left-handed.

1680
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,700
People are something for whatever reason, that's just the orientation

1681
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:44,500
of the coding system.

1682
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,700
It has nothing to do with whether you're right-handed or left-handed.

1683
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:50,800
It's just saying which hand tells you the winding and the axis

1684
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,100
Direction that's about it.

1685
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:58,600
And in some sense you would think if you know I suppose there's

1686
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,200
there's certainly more right-handed people in the world than

1687
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:01,900
left-handed people.

1688
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:05,500
But oddly enough if you think about it mathematically speaking this is

1689
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:08,000
actually made more for left-handed people than for any other people.

1690
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,500
Because if you are doing math you probably have a pencil in your

1691
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:14,700
dominant hand and your dominant hand, in the case of a right-handed

1692
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:18,000
person is their right hand, which means they cannot actually curl that

1693
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,700
hand to check.

1694
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,100
So it's actually a left-handed person holding a

1695
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:29,300
And or a pencil doing math who can actually invoke the right hand rule

1696
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,000
fastest, not a right-handed person.

1697
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,000
So I don't know why they picked it.

1698
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:37,800
It clearly wasn't to favor, right handed people.

1699
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:43,700
If anything it's sort of favors left-handed people, I don't know if

1700
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,200
there was a deeper reason.

1701
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:48,100
Why counterclockwise is important.

1702
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:51,600
It could be in that math way that like there's some weird nonsense

1703
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,100
about like quantum physics is right.

1704
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,600
Handed by nature or something weird like this where this the windings

1705
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:56,700
are?

1706
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:57,100
That way?

1707
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,900
I have no idea, you know, sometimes stuff like that comes up and

1708
01:55:59,900 --> 01:56:01,600
you're like, oh no it's not arbitrary.

1709
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:06,000
It's here for a reason that could be I have never heard of one though.

1710
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,700
Like no one's ever told me.

1711
01:56:07,900 --> 01:56:12,100
Oh yeah, it's because of this fundamental physical principle.

1712
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,100
So, it makes sense.

1713
01:56:13,100 --> 01:56:15,600
That mass should always be, you know, this way.

1714
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:18,300
So, I don't know why it's that way.

1715
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,100
That's just what it is.

1716
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,300
The size of a debug camera pan control.

1717
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,200
Might be a good idea.

1718
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:27,700
I do agree.

1719
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:28,800
That's probably true.

1720
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,500
Probably wait till we actually need it.

1721
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:31,100
But yes.

1722
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:37,100
Correct tivities.

1723
01:56:37,100 --> 01:56:39,800
Why have everything slightly tilted?

1724
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:42,500
Wouldn't it make more sense to sort the assets according to their

1725
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,100
bottom or if you're using 3D space go for Ortho camera and using the Z

1726
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:46,900
position for sorting.

1727
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,400
So I think there's kind of two questions in there.

1728
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:55,000
Because why have everything slightly tilted is is an aesthetic

1729
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,700
question.

1730
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:59,800
Right now, to programming question, whereas the second part

1731
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:00,800
A programming question.

1732
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,400
So I'm not sure if those are supposed to be related, they don't sound

1733
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,300
like it, so I'll answer them separately.

1734
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,300
But if they're supposed to be related, you can let me know.

1735
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:13,600
So, the reason I kind of like having everything slightly tilted

1736
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:17,400
potentially is it just adds a little bit more visual interest, right?

1737
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:19,400
It adds a little bit more depth to the scene.

1738
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:23,200
So you know if I've got the debug camera here, I can I can play

1739
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:28,200
certainly with various ways of keeping this scene oriented and if I

1740
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:29,800
want to let you know, I can have it be

1741
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,200
The straight up and down the problem with having to be straight up and

1742
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,600
down, is I would lose a little bit.

1743
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:41,700
Perhaps, potentially of that sort of ability to harmonize the Sprites

1744
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,200
with the background, right?

1745
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:49,300
And what I mean by that and you'll kind of see, you can actually see

1746
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:53,700
this in the way that we are doing the handmade hero art, which we

1747
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:54,300
should probably.

1748
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:55,800
Like I said, we need to put it in sometime.

1749
01:57:55,800 --> 01:58:01,200
Soon, let's go ahead and go to Molly rocket.

1750
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,200
So if you take a look at the way that we're doing, the handmade here

1751
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:11,800
are here, you can actually see that we're taking a pretty top down

1752
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:16,400
perspective to it to try and keep it closer to the actual perspective

1753
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,200
of the action.

1754
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,400
And so part of making those Sprites be

1755
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:27,100
Part of harmonizing them with the background is perhaps reflecting

1756
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:29,800
that tilt a little bit in the perspective of the background so that

1757
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,500
your is to do less work to sort of harmonize those and understand

1758
01:58:34,500 --> 01:58:36,300
things spatially, right?

1759
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:41,000
We could have made it so that you were directly top down but then you

1760
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,900
lose a lot of the character of the Sprites.

1761
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:45,900
Because if you're directly top down, you can't really even see

1762
01:58:45,900 --> 01:58:46,700
someone's face.

1763
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:50,900
And so there are games, you know, like Hotline Miami for example, or

1764
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:51,900
something like that.

1765
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:53,300
Where you take a look?

1766
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:58,100
At the way they did it and it is directly top-down, right?

1767
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,400
And so that's not necessarily because I can't actually get a bigger.

1768
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,900
There we go.

1769
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:08,100
So that's not necessarily a bad idea because you can see games that

1770
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:13,500
have done it and you know, they work but it definitely it definitely

1771
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:17,900
has the effect of distances saying you a certain amount from the

1772
01:59:17,900 --> 01:59:20,000
character of the game.

1773
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,700
And in some cases like hot my light Hotline Miami that may be very

1774
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:26,300
appropriate.

1775
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:31,500
I mean this is a game about kind of a lot of, you know, Mass Slaughter

1776
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:36,200
and some you know, Crazy Action sequences where everyone is dying,

1777
01:59:36,200 --> 01:59:39,600
including you all the time and there's blood everywhere and it's you

1778
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:44,900
know, a giant sort of essentially desensitized thing.

1779
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:49,200
It makes some sense to go, you know, we don't really necessarily want

1780
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,400
this game to be about seeing the characters expressions or

1781
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:55,300
Because that, you know, there's a lot of reasons why he wouldn't want

1782
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:55,700
that.

1783
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:59,500
But you know, in a game like handmade hero, it's a little bit

1784
01:59:59,500 --> 01:59:59,900
different.

1785
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:04,400
Where we kind of have these characters that you did want to see their

1786
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:05,000
faces.

1787
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,200
So, you know, it's a little bit more.

1788
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:09,600
Angled like that.

1789
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,700
And so that's why I think I might like it to be, you know, it might

1790
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:17,200
not be this angle but it might be a little bit.

1791
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:26,400
Angled, in terms of the way in which the camera is is placed relative

1792
02:00:26,900 --> 02:00:28,900
in terms of tilt relative to the world.

1793
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:32,100
That's just my gut feeling.

1794
02:00:32,100 --> 02:00:35,000
And again you know these are not that's not some kind of a

1795
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,900
prescription or saying you have to do it that way because every game

1796
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:41,800
is different and the appropriate thing to do in any particular game is

1797
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,300
is definitely different.

1798
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:49,700
So you know something like this is probably what I would be looking

1799
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:49,900
for.

1800
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:53,900
But I again I'm not quite sure yet exactly what I want there but

1801
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:59,500
that's the basic idea as for your other questions which was

1802
02:00:59,700 --> 02:01:03,900
Sort of more about programming that the Aesthetics of it, I you said,

1803
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:06,600
would it make more sense to sort the assets according to their bottom?

1804
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:11,400
And the answer there is that you actually can't do that.

1805
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:16,000
So we spent some time on him and they're looking at that and that does

1806
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,600
not actually work for any kind of complex sort of seeing that you

1807
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,700
might want to create.

1808
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:23,600
There's a bunch of cases that don't work.

1809
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:28,900
If you sort that way and there a lot of cases that we wanted, you can

1810
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:29,500
go back and watch.

1811
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,200
The episodes on sorting where we talked about this in a little more

1812
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:32,800
detail.

1813
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,700
I would also recommend you

1814
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:38,800
Let's see here.

1815
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:43,400
Retro City Rampage.

1816
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:49,900
I would refer you to

1817
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,300
not that one.

1818
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:58,700
Is it?

1819
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,200
It's not, right?

1820
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,800
Is it Retro City?

1821
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,000
What's the new?

1822
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:05,000
There's a new one.

1823
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,700
I can't remember the name of the new one.

1824
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:14,700
It's not Retro City.

1825
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:17,300
Rampage, it's Retro City.

1826
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:18,600
Something else.

1827
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,800
River City Ransom, that's what it is.

1828
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,400
Sorry, I got that wrong.

1829
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,800
So I would I would highly recommend reading this because it's laid out

1830
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,200
in a nice concise blog format and basically

1831
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:54,000
this is a case where Andrew Russell took some stuff we were talking

1832
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,200
about and handmade hero and he was like, oh hey, I've already had to

1833
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:59,800
deal with this in the game that

1834
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Working on, which is River City.

1835
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:07,800
Ransom and let me tell you more about how I did it and sort of like

1836
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:11,100
what we're going to do here, right?

1837
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:16,400
And so, he points out some really obvious when you think about them.

1838
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:21,100
But not obvious until you've actually gone through the work cases

1839
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,400
where you need to do relatively complex things.

1840
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:27,200
If you want sprite rolls to start properly and they all have to do

1841
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,800
with the fact that perspective is kind of baked into Sprites when

1842
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:30,700
artists draw them.

1843
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,300
And you can kind of see here.

1844
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:36,300
This really simple example that you wouldn't think twice about where

1845
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:39,900
for example you've got this car here and that's you know all you

1846
02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:40,900
really needed to know, right?

1847
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,000
Is there's a car and I got some

1848
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:45,200
Writes well just sort them by the Baseline like you said, but of

1849
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:48,800
course, it doesn't work at all to do that because you may find that

1850
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:54,200
depending on where they are logically relative to these things, it may

1851
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:56,600
be that sometimes starting by the Baseline works and sometimes from

1852
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:58,600
the Baseline does not work, right?

1853
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:03,700
And so what he found is that the only real way to do that particularly

1854
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:10,200
well is to actually do use some logic about, he actually has some

1855
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:11,600
voxel information in there.

1856
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:15,700
Use logic about how the perspective is encoded in this, right?

1857
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:20,300
And use that, which is pretty hardcore, right?

1858
02:04:21,700 --> 02:04:28,100
So, hopefully that blog entry, I don't know, the easiest way to get to

1859
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:32,600
it, but let's see what the minimum Search terms are.

1860
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:50,400
So River Sprite.

1861
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,600
Sorting seems to be the quickest way to get there.

1862
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:59,700
Maybe I don't know if that'll actually work or not but I would highly

1863
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:04,800
recommend that blog entry as a good way to just kind of be like okay I

1864
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:09,200
see why this is a little bit harder if you actually want to have some

1865
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:10,200
complex cases.

1866
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:15,200
Obviously you can design your whole game around avoiding these, and

1867
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:18,000
then and then sort by the Baseline sir.

1868
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:21,400
We, you know, you can special case stuff, and sort of hack together,

1869
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,200
something that works.

1870
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,000
But I was kind of more interested in something that would be a little

1871
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,700
bit more expressive and not require a lot of special casing.

1872
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,100
And so, this is what I felt like was the most logical thing.

1873
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:38,100
In terms of your final question which was wouldn't it make more sense?

1874
02:05:38,100 --> 02:05:42,000
I'm sorry if you're using 3D space go for an orthogonal camera using

1875
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,500
the Z position for sorting and the answer is I'm not sure.

1876
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:47,100
I really want, orthogonal camera.

1877
02:05:47,100 --> 02:05:50,100
I like we've done some stuff with like room stacked on top of each

1878
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:52,200
other and I kind of like having the perspective in there.

1879
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
So I don't know that I really want an orthographic camera.

1880
02:05:56,900 --> 02:05:59,500
So we're probably going to stick with the protect the camera even if

1881
02:05:59,500 --> 02:05:59,800
we only

1882
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,100
It's relatively subtle camera effects.

1883
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:04,300
That's probably still going to stay that way.

1884
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:09,700
And it's not particularly hard for us to deal with, really, I don't

1885
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:14,700
think because like I said, the only real artifact that I'm thinking

1886
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:19,700
of, is the one where we just is, the one where things are very sort

1887
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:22,600
of, because they're very slanted, they interpenetrate things behind

1888
02:06:22,600 --> 02:06:22,800
them.

1889
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,300
And all, I really have to do is modify the Z value for the depth

1890
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,000
buffer.

1891
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:29,900
And I think I'd probably be okay.

1892
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,900
Are, I don't think it's gonna be too bad.

1893
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:41,900
That's the old.

1894
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:45,200
I noticed the camera in hand made here is defined by camera x y z and

1895
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:45,500
P.

1896
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:49,600
Can I get x y z kind of get x y and C from a quaternion?

1897
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:50,800
Is that a good idea?

1898
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:53,900
I mean, if you had quite turn Ian's on handmade hero, would you define

1899
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:56,000
the camera using A quaternion and P?

1900
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:57,200
The answer is yes.

1901
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:00,700
If I had quaternions and handmade here right now, I would use A

1902
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:05,400
quaternion and P and I would generate the XYZ axes from the

1903
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,100
quaternion.

1904
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:14,600
It's not particularly difficult because a quaternion one of the first

1905
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:15,800
things that you will learn to do.

1906
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:18,900
If you learn quaternions, is how to turn a quaternion into a matrix

1907
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:23,300
and if you turn a quaternion to a matrix as I've sort of gone over

1908
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:27,000
multiple times on handmade hero, you know how to extract the axes from

1909
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:27,500
that.

1910
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:34,000
So you can just look at the math for turning country into a matrix and

1911
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,900
it's very clear just from looking at what the terms are of that

1912
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:37,500
Matrix.

1913
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,300
Exactly what the

1914
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:39,700
Terms would be for the axes.

1915
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:44,200
So it's very, very simple to turn a quaternion into a set of three

1916
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:46,000
axes if that's what you would prefer.

1917
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:50,200
And so in cases like these, when we want to be able to access those,

1918
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:52,400
there's no mystery to it.

1919
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,300
It's really no different.

1920
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:56,100
It's very straightforward.

1921
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:20,100
All right, let's see, the last question.

1922
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:22,300
What is the X and B, 32 x and use rejects?

1923
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:26,200
Those are there just to specify that I don't actually care.

1924
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:30,700
If there are 32 bits, just as just that they are, as long as 32 bits

1925
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
or rather can store 32 bits, but they could be 64 bits or anything

1926
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:35,400
else.

1927
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:44,300
I go back and forth on some of these things, one of the big problems

1928
02:08:44,300 --> 02:08:45,300
that you end up with.

1929
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
So, so, so there's there's a lot of issues, right?

1930
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:53,800
And I don't want to go down a huge Rat Hole on this because it

1931
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,200
literally has nothing to do with.

1932
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:59,200
You know, anything that we're going to have to really think about it

1933
02:08:59,200 --> 02:08:59,800
all here.

1934
02:09:00,300 --> 02:09:05,400
You know, so it's not critical to handmade hero but I'll just point it

1935
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:11,100
out and that is that there's usually two things that you need to

1936
02:09:11,100 --> 02:09:18,500
specify in when you're when you're talking about a variable or a

1937
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:19,900
member of a structure, whatever.

1938
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,600
There's like, exactly.

1939
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,200
You know, n Bits.

1940
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,000
and at least,

1941
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:44,500
So when you think about these cases, why do you need them?

1942
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:50,200
The answer is that if I'm doing something like structured, use of

1943
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:55,900
memory or reading from a file, then exactly n Bits may be important.

1944
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:59,200
The reason it may be important is let's say I've got something like a

1945
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:03,100
bitmap header on disk and the specification for the bitmap header is

1946
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,100
like it's got a u16, right?

1947
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:07,400
So it's got an unsigned 16 bit value.

1948
02:10:08,700 --> 02:10:10,700
That's like, you know, the

1949
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:14,000
The width or something.

1950
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:16,800
NAU 16.

1951
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:17,700
That's the height.

1952
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:21,800
And this is in my header.

1953
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:25,900
Well, I can't very well tell the compiler.

1954
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:30,600
You know, there's a width value and it's got to be at least 16 bits,

1955
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,200
but I don't really care how big it is.

1956
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:35,300
And then another one, that's a height value because I'm reading these

1957
02:10:35,300 --> 02:10:36,100
out of the file.

1958
02:10:36,500 --> 02:10:40,000
And so if I expect to read them in a block, and then look at them

1959
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,200
right in the file, in memory, as they were in the file, their can't.

1960
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:48,800
It has to be exactly 16 bits because the next value starts right there

1961
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,200
after 16 bits worth of information.

1962
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:53,400
Was the height.

1963
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:58,400
So I need to be able to say, for laying out things in case, they're in

1964
02:10:58,400 --> 02:10:59,400
file formats.

1965
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:02,300
Or in case you're getting transmitted over a network where they're

1966
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:06,300
going into a data format that has to be understood by multiple

1967
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,000
machines, that maybe have code working on different compilers of

1968
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:10,800
different languages.

1969
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,200
This has to be specified.

1970
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:12,900
Exactly.

1971
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:16,300
And so one thing you're doing is specifying exactly, n Bits.

1972
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:22,300
And so in my parlance, I use like you 16, you 32s, 16, whatever, I use

1973
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:22,500
these

1974
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:23,600
For exactly.

1975
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:28,700
But there's other times where you don't actually need things to be

1976
02:11:28,700 --> 02:11:29,500
exactly.

1977
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:35,100
And in that case, I try to use a syntax, I didn't really do it on

1978
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:37,600
handmade here originally and then I started doing because we're just a

1979
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:39,500
force of habit so I apologize.

1980
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:40,300
It's in there now.

1981
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:44,000
But my intention was to skip it because I didn't really want to get

1982
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,300
into it but I ended up doing it anyway and at least in bits is like

1983
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,700
you 32x.

1984
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:52,700
You 16 x Etc.

1985
02:11:54,900 --> 02:11:59,400
These are saying well I need 32 bits of space because the

1986
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:01,800
Requires that much.

1987
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,600
But if your operations are faster.

1988
02:12:07,600 --> 02:12:17,200
On 64 bits instead, use it because some CPUs are faster when they

1989
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:20,200
don't have to downshift to smaller than their native sighs.

1990
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:26,400
Sometimes it's more expensive it takes more operations for example you

1991
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:31,100
know on something let I don't know probably like I think a powerpc had

1992
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:36,700
this at one point certainly Intel had it I think at one point with you

1993
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:37,300
16s

1994
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:41,300
Can't quite remember though, where there were cases where using the

1995
02:12:41,300 --> 02:12:45,200
32-bit values, it's faster than using a 16-bit value.

1996
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:47,200
So, forcing the compiler to the 65.

1997
02:12:47,200 --> 02:12:49,600
You can slow it down right, again.

1998
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:53,700
Not always the case on Modern Intel CPUs, like the ones in this

1999
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:57,600
computer right here, I don't know that there's any penalties of that

2000
02:12:57,600 --> 02:12:58,200
nature.

2001
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:10,700
Well, the top of my head, I can't think of any penalties for using a

2002
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:15,200
smaller type than a larger type at the moment.

2003
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:16,800
But doesn't mean there aren't?

2004
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:20,900
I just can't think of them but that is not always the case.

2005
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:24,400
And on different platforms, you will encounter this problem.

2006
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:29,200
And so I try to notate my code at least to a certain extent with that

2007
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:29,700
information.

2008
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:33,400
So it makes it easier for me to tune it later on platforms like that.

2009
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,900
How much time and effort, do you spend preparing for each episode?

2010
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:57,500
01 of the requirements I had for doing the series, as I wanted to

2011
02:13:57,500 --> 02:14:00,300
basically have to do everything on the stream with no preparation.

2012
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,200
So there's never any preparation.

2013
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:06,300
I just sit down and do the series programming.

2014
02:14:06,300 --> 02:14:10,400
What I would, you know, as close as possible doing what I would

2015
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,400
normally do in whatever the programming situation is, I just try to

2016
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:14,400
explain it as I go.

2017
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:32,900
Oh, and Mansfield asked why be 32x and not be 1X or b8x?

2018
02:14:33,700 --> 02:14:34,900
That's another good question.

2019
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:41,400
So you know I use B to indicate a Boolean, right?

2020
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:45,000
And so the question is why not be 1X?

2021
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,800
Because a Boolean only needs one bit.

2022
02:14:47,900 --> 02:14:52,700
Surely you don't need 32 bits for Boolean so isn't 32x, you know kind

2023
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:53,100
of wrong.

2024
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:57,400
The answer is because that's not actually what I use that syntax.

2025
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:59,700
for, when I use,

2026
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,500
A bee is just letting me know.

2027
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,300
That.

2028
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:09,100
I intend the value to be used in a billion fashion.

2029
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:14,500
So 0 is false and any other value is true, that's all the be means for

2030
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:14,900
me.

2031
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,300
So what the actual size part means is what I expect it to harmonize

2032
02:15:21,300 --> 02:15:26,300
with because I'm going to be using those values intermixed with other

2033
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:27,200
integer values.

2034
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:32,600
So the answer is I pick the Boolean size based on whatever the size is

2035
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:35,100
of the stuff around it, that I'm using it with typically.

2036
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:39,400
But that's it.

2037
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:41,700
If that makes sense.

2038
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:50,300
And dude, and baseman, who is asking, can I can we do cubic spline?

2039
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:56,900
Sometimes we probably will do a cubic spline on here at some point but

2040
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:59,400
I would I would just point out the fact.

2041
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:10,200
That that's actually up here somewhere.

2042
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:12,300
Here it is.

2043
02:16:14,600 --> 02:16:21,000
So, if you go to this stream, this is an hour long stream.

2044
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,800
That explains cubic spline interpolation, really explicitly, right?

2045
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:31,300
You can kind of it's It's it has everything.

2046
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:34,799
From start to finish on cubic splines.

2047
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:36,500
So, you know,

2048
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:45,000
If you want to check that out, that's everything that you we would

2049
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,299
cover on this, if we get there.

2050
02:16:50,299 --> 02:16:51,500
It's already in that video.

2051
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,799
All right, so that's about it.

2052
02:17:01,799 --> 02:17:03,600
I'm going to go ahead and close it down.

2053
02:17:07,299 --> 02:17:09,000
Alright everyone, thank you very much for joining me for another

2054
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:09,700
episode of handmade here.

2055
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,700
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

2056
02:17:10,700 --> 02:17:14,100
As always, if you want following series, you can always prayer to the

2057
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,700
game on handmade hero dot-org.

2058
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:19,400
It comes to the source code so you can play around with it and

2059
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,200
experiment.

2060
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,200
We also have a forum site.

2061
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:21,799
You can go to.

2062
02:17:21,799 --> 02:17:25,200
If you want to ask questions, we have a patreon page, you can use to

2063
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:26,400
support the video series.

2064
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:29,600
We have a schedule bot, which treats the schedule at you, if you want

2065
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:33,000
to know, what days and what times were going to be live?

2066
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,200
And then you have an episode guide, you can go to if you want to catch

2067
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:36,900
up on old episodes.

2068
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:38,799
That's about it for this week.

2069
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:39,500
I'll be back.

2070
02:17:39,500 --> 02:17:41,400
I'm sorry, not for this week for today.

2071
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:45,400
I'll be back tomorrow when we can.

2072
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:47,299
I think just we just need to do some debugging.

2073
02:17:47,299 --> 02:17:50,100
Now there's a couple bugs in there that we need to take care of.

2074
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:57,700
And you know, I don't know, maybe go ahead and do the split sorting

2075
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,799
for things like Shadows that are going to have.

2076
02:18:00,299 --> 02:18:03,600
Be drawn in a second pass so we can probably do those two things

2077
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:04,000
tomorrow.

2078
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,200
And then next weekend, we'll start on the open gel stuff that we need

2079
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:14,900
to do in terms of putting in some Shader code and multi sample

2080
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:16,200
anti-aliasing resolves.

2081
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,799
So that we can clean up the artifacts that we have in there like the

2082
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:24,000
sort problem and the fringy Blinky Edge stuff which needs to get taken

2083
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,400
care of.

2084
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:29,100
So I hope you'll join me for those.

2085
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:34,100
That's about it until tomorrow have fun programming and I'll see

2086
02:18:34,100 --> 02:18:35,100
everyone on the internet.

2087
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:36,000
Take it easy, everybody.
