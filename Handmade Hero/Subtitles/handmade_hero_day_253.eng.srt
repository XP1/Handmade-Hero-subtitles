00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,000
Start recording.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero in a tree today.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
We are going to be finishing up a little bit of our debug edit code.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We got it working actually yesterday, but we are still using like old

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,800
guids.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,700
We're using some old style stuff in our debug system from when we were

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,800
still exploring options.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,300
And so we got some cleaning up to do to make sure like highlighting

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,600
works properly and then we probably want to also try to re-enable some

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,300
editing for other kinds of values.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,700
Like we had anything in there for me.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,200
Any twos and stuff, but I don't know if that's still enabled, so we

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,400
want to just kind of go through clean out the old debug ID system,

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,600
which we don't need any more.

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,700
We can just use the quiz now.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,600
I believe and that should just be, that should be about it.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,600
So,

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,400
Today is day, 253 and day.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,000
253 comes after day 252.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,900
So if you are following along at home with the source code, you want

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,200
to unpack day to 52s Source here because that's what I'm starting with

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,800
and you will be in a weird place if you start with different code than

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,300
that.

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:19,400
So yeah, if if I remember correctly coming through here with if we run

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,700
things,

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Everything is now working properly.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,600
We can edit our values in that sort of stuff.

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,200
I don't remember too much about what these deeper values are actually

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,000
supposed to do, but I think they just only move when somebody

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
actually, yeah, like we had like this, so you could set it to whether

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,400
you were the cameras following or whether it would only update when

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,800
when the hero kind of moved into a new area, this was not actually

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,000
code be overusing, but we use it for other tests debug value.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,900
So that's all good.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
And we also have this

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
Mode from the from a while.

37
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,700
Back that's just used for testing.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we have a bunch of stuff in here and it looks like that's working.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,300
Okay.

40
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, so we should probably go ahead and and just sort of clean this

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
stuff up.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,500
Get highlighting working for these again and also now, because we

43
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,900
decided to leave those squids as full strings.

44
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,700
What we probably want to do is clip so that when we print them out,

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,700
we're actually printing them out in some kind of a reasonable fashion.

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:19,900
Like, we

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,800
We want to actually cut it down to some, you know, some reasonable

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,000
amount of of some reasonable.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
Like, we don't need all of this stuff on here, right?

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
We can just parse to the end of that.

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,700
So we want to do just a couple things like that and I think that's

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,700
basically it.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So we've got oh right?

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,400
I forgot.

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,700
We even did this little thing here where you can view and of these.

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,500
So we don't really know at the moment.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We actually I don't think ever went back and re-enable, the ability to

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
view bitmaps either.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,300
I could be wrong about that.

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't really know if we select an entity.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,700
We don't see the bitmaps here anymore.

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,600
So that's also something that probably should be working.

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
And the fact that it's not working, suggest that maybe we introduced a

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
bug there somewhere.

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
At least I would assume we did.

66
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,100
Like I said, don't really know, but just assume so yeah.

67
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,500
So I think we're pretty good and

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,600
Don't really know why I'm still talking.

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,600
I think I'm still sort of hung up about the fact that there was guy in

70
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,000
a tree.

71
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
Anyway, here we go.

72
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,200
Let's go ahead and launch the editor and again like I said, I think

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,900
I'm just going to try to focus on cleaning up this code because I want

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
to sort of get it down to a nice place where we can sort of say that

75
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,500
the debug code is you know, reasonable and we're okay with it.

76
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
Looks like we're still building in release mode there which we don't

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,100
really need at the moment.

78
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,900
So I'm going to turn that off and just continue to build in debug

79
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,300
mode.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Just about bills.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
Tend to be a little bit faster.

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,500
Usually that tends to be the case.

83
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,600
As you can kind of see there at, sped it up a bit after it's used to

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,800
building and everything's in the cache.

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
So let's go ahead and take a look here at

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,900
And handmade debug.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So we've already got this thing here.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,300
That was start last /.

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,300
And start at, lash lash is just going to be like started last pipe,

90
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,800
really?

91
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,200
And then we could use that to clean up those names because we already

92
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
word sort of doing that before.

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
And then we decided we didn't really need to do it.

94
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,100
But it turns out we really probably should because we sort of want to

95
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
get rid of that bit.

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,700
So I now need to pass that when we're printing things, I think

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,100
possibly this maybe should be the default to be honest.

98
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,400
So

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,800
I think this should probably be like, you know, don't start at last

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,200
play for like, use entire Grid or something like this or print show

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
entire grid, something like that.

102
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,500
I don't know.

103
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,700
Let's, let's just say that.

104
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
That was the case.

105
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,100
And that way, just by default, we just assume that nobody wants to

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,200
print out that grid information.

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,300
Because why would they it doesn't seem to make any sense.

108
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
And so we'll see if we can make that work.

109
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,100
Why is that not working?

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,700
I know why it's because this is supposed to be a not we're trying to

111
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,700
say if it's not set to show entire grid then we scan for the end of

112
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,900
our little grid thing there.

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,000
And then we hopefully

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,000
There we go.

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
So now our names are what the actual variables are, which seems like a

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,900
good idea and now we just have to go through and make sure that when

117
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,800
we sort of mouse over these things, they actually highlight the reason

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
that they're not having right now, I believe it's just because we have

119
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,500
this extraneous.

120
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,800
Debug ID stuff.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,400
There's potentially interesting reasons for having it.

122
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,000
so, I mean, I don't want to pretend that it was useless because the

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,500
idea behind the debug IDs is if we wanted to sort of have ways of

124
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,800
identifying sort of more

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,300
Are sort of more stuff.

126
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,200
And I think, the key thing that I that I kind of want to to consider

127
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,700
here is really the only part that I think we need to care about for

128
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,100
having debug IDs that are not just the grid, is really just when we do

129
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,700
those open, debug block, close, debug block things.

130
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,600
If that's supposed to refer to, like a particular entity or something,

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,900
then, you know, maybe that's important in some way, but

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
But even then, I don't know that it is because the, debug IDs for

133
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,000
editing purposes are really only important on that particular frame.

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,600
So, I don't even know if that makes any sense.

135
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,900
So, I'm not sure that we care really about these debug IDs at all.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,300
So, I'm going to just exercise them for now.

137
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,100
And just assumed that, that was an experiment.

138
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,100
We just don't need to really keep anything from and wherever we were

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,600
using debug IDs before we can just use the grid right.

140
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,000
Which is or rather even not even the grid.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,300
We can just use the debug element pointer because those debug element

142
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,800
pointers never go away.

143
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,700
We always keep a debug element for everything so we should be able to

144
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
do something more like that.

145
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
I think, let's give it a shot.

146
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,000
We'll see what happens.

147
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,600
So if I am to delete debug IDs entirely from the system, you can see

148
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,300
them here.

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,900
I'll go ahead and just ice that out.

150
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
So we don't care about this.

151
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,500
I don't also know.

152
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
I'm not sure what this is actually used for.

153
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,800
Completely honest with you.

154
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,300
So I may also just get rid of that temporarily just to see so it

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,100
because I don't really know why it's there and I'm not sure it should

156
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,600
be there.

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
So I'm going to get rid of this as well.

158
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,000
Like so and I don't know, debug you, I enabled.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,600
Not sure what that's about.

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,500
We'll take a look at that as well at some point.

161
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,200
So let's recompile debug ID, so the debug hit stuff.

162
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
So I think for this again,

163
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,200
with, with, with this debug ID thing, what we can do there is probably

164
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,800
just

165
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,500
Well, honestly, you know, we could even save the debug ID only for

166
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,700
debug hit me if we wanted to, if we want to just keep that path

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,400
working the same way.

168
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,900
It was, we could just have debug IDs or strictly for that purpose.

169
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,100
They don't do anything else, I'm not sure if that's necessary or not.

170
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,500
It feels like the answer is probably not.

171
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,100
So I think what we could probably do is sadiebug IDs.

172
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Maybe just aren't important and maybe we just always use

173
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,400
Well now you know what?

174
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm just going to leave it.

175
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,800
I'm just gonna leave it because why not?

176
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,100
So I think all I really need to do is just get like I'll leave debug

177
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,400
ID in here and it can be used for people who external And all I'll do

178
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,200
the only place.

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,800
I'll actually

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It is inside the debug system itself because those don't need to do

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,700
anything anymore other than use other than be used by the hit system.

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,900
So something like this, where we have a debug view, for example with a

183
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,300
debug ID that says what it's actually tracking we can just get rid of

184
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,800
that concept and use the debug element directly.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Now, the other thing we can do is everywhere, we would have generated

186
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,500
a debug ID for something, we can just generate a debug element.

187
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,800
Instead are we can just

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wrap the debug element in a debug ID and still use it, but I'm not

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,300
sure that there's any reason to do that.

190
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
it seems like just unnecessary complexity, so,

191
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe we'll just do that.

192
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,400
And of course at that point I am also not sure.

193
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah, you know what?

194
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,500
I keep saying we'll get rid of it and then I'm like, well do I really

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,300
need to get rid of it?

196
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,000
It seems like, after all that really, I can just leave it in there and

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
all I have to do is just use the debug element as the pointer from now

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,400
on.

199
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I think that's it.

200
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,900
Because it seems like that just works.

201
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,700
I think that would just be fine.

202
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,700
So like for example, when we're tracking all this stuff with, you

203
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,300
know, what's selected and and taught values and all that stuff, I feel

204
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,600
like we can just I feel like the debug I systems probably fine maybe I

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,200
was overreacting, maybe it's actually reasonable, like all this stuff

206
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,500
would just work and when we do debug ID from grid, it would just you

207
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,700
know, do it like this and it would be fine.

208
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,200
So I think the only problem probably is when we're doing this, we

209
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,000
should just make sure which, which grid we're looking at here.

210
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Looks like we never actually generate that value though.

211
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,900
So, let's just take a look.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,100
I guess I'll be really need to see.

213
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Is why look, what are we using for the debug IDs right now?

214
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,900
And why, you know, why isn't that sufficient?

215
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
So here's like, looks like we're never really building them.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,300
Hmm.

217
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:16,700
All right.

218
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,100
Well, so maybe this will be a lot easier than I thought, to maybe that

219
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,300
whole system could stay in place.

220
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,500
Maybe it's totally reasonable.

221
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,700
And all we need to do is just go fix this one part where we're

222
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,600
printing it out.

223
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,800
Okay, so that's fine.

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,200
I'm down.

225
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,500
That I apologize.

226
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,200
Debug IDs are saying your extraneous but really you seem pretty sanely

227
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,300
designed and I don't think there's any reason to get rid of you

228
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,700
because it looks like you're doing a useful thing.

229
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,400
So let's see.

230
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,500
We need to track back to wherever we would actually be using this.

231
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,100
We've got the debug event to text thing here, so that's where we're

232
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,700
actually printing out our stuff.

233
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,100
And when we're doing our default interactions,

234
00:11:59,400 --> 00:11:59,900
When we?

235
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,500
When we do this, we need, I assume the default interaction stuff does

236
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,300
wrap up.

237
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Well, wouldn't it?

238
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
It would have to wrap up what the debug ID was.

239
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,600
So here, is that what we call debug draw that we passed the debug ID

240
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,200
in.

241
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,400
And so the question is, why is that debug event not matching up with

242
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,100
anything?

243
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,800
Because interaction is hot, should be returning to

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,500
True.

245
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,400
If we're actually, if this actually worked so there's debug draw

246
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,500
element again with the debug ID.

247
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,400
Let's take one more look here.

248
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,800
So here is a sort of accessing all the elements as we go down and get

249
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,300
looks like

250
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,400
The debug ID is just made from the link, so it's made from this.

251
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,100
Variable link here.

252
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,500
The thing that's inside the variable group, that's what it's actually

253
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,100
made from.

254
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't see why that's a problem, though.

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,200
I mean that should be fine, right?

256
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,900
We made like,

257
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,100
We made the debug idea from that.

258
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,400
And when we actually come through here, it does work to toggle.

259
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
So we know the debug ID can't be completely wrong.

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,700
So the question is just Why aren't we getting any highlighting, right?

261
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,400
And I would assume that since debugged element is getting past this

262
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,500
debug ID here.

263
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,100
I don't understand why the why we're not seeing a difference in color

264
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,500
when we come through because here's like our is hot call for debug

265
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,200
draw event and

266
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Can see here is that it's just testing to see whether that interaction

267
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,700
is hot or not, and I'm not sure why it wouldn't be.

268
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Let's take a look to see if there's a reason why maybe the

269
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,500
interactions not getting set to hot properly.

270
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,300
Maybe there's something we're not doing in here that we should be

271
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,700
doing because you can see we do begin element, rectangle, default,

272
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,400
interaction and element.

273
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,500
So in here in theory that should be setting the hot interaction as

274
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
necessary, right?

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
At least I believe so.

276
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
So let's take a look.

277
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,900
So element interaction.

278
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Yeah, on and element, here we go with end element, right?

279
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
This does whatever it does here.

280
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

281
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,500
So this if it's in the rectangle the next hot interaction equal-sized

282
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,300
interaction.

283
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,900
Right?

284
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
That's for scalable things.

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,600
We've got next time.

286
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,700
Interaction equals element interaction, which is the the default one.

287
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,200
If we're inside the bounds of the element

288
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,800
And that all just seems like it should work because I can't see why it

289
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,400
wouldn't.

290
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,800
If we are able to click, you would think that it would be able to

291
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,600
highlight properly and it doesn't.

292
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,300
But that doesn't really make sense.

293
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,400
So, let me just check interaction is hot and make sure that there

294
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,100
isn't something about that.

295
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,200
That I don't understand.

296
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,400
So, let's go ahead and go to interaction is hot and just see

297
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,000
So interaction is hot goes to see whether to interactions are equal,

298
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,500
the one in the debug State and the one that we're testing which is

299
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,900
what you would expect it.

300
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,600
Test to see if the to debug IDs are equal, the types of interactions

301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,400
are equal.

302
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,800
And whether A and B are generically the same is that just like, is the

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,600
generic.

304
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,500
I think that just is is a different type.

305
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,800
That's just the test.

306
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
That one value part of it, right?

307
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,500
Let's verify that.

308
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,200
That's just generic is just a way of comparing two things for

309
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,600
equivalence when we don't really know which one we're talking about,

310
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,100
right?

311
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,200
So all that is is, is let's see here.

312
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Where is it?

313
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,800
Where is it interaction?

314
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,100
It's just testing like, basically all of these, right?

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So yeah, I don't know why that would be busted.

316
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,400
So I'm going to have to step through that.

317
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,700
I think I can't think of any way not to to be honest because it just

318
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,200
seems like that always actually pretty reasonable.

319
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,200
So if I go here, that'd be the first one.

320
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,900
That I would come across.

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,300
And so I'm just going to set a breakpoint now live as it's running to

322
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,800
sort of figure out when it does interaction is hot.

323
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,500
I just want to take a look at to see why it's not considering itself

324
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,800
hot, right?

325
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,900
So let's see here, and let's see if this is the correct one.

326
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,000
First of all, this is

327
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,300
Stored event Loop stored event.

328
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
There's the event.

329
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,200
It is global rendering type.

330
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,900
That does sound like a reasonable one.

331
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
That would have been first, right?

332
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:54,500
So let's take a look and see what we ended up with here in interaction

333
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,100
is hot.

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,900
So we test interactions are equal, we get 0, which is

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,800
We expect because it's obviously not drawing as hot.

336
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,900
Let's took a look at A and B and C.

337
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,400
What we see here, a is the hot interaction.

338
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,100
So this is the hot interaction and the values of these.

339
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,500
I look basically the same up here, right?

340
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,800
Those are the same pointers both of these totally the same pointer.

341
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,600
So, the ID should compare the same.

342
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,300
They are both Auto modified variable requests.

343
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,000
So the only difference is the generic is different and I'm not sure

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,400
why the generic is different.

345
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,000
So I'm going to go ahead and take a look.

346
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,400
It's probably because the story event is perhaps getting used rather

347
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,300
than the element.

348
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,900
So it's the hot, I think, probably what's happening, right?

349
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,500
Is we record the values over time and we're probably

350
00:18:59,600 --> 00:18:59,900
Bleep.

351
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,300
Talking about the only the latest value instead of talking about all

352
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,400
values because we only care about the element being hot.

353
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,000
Not a particular instance of a record.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
Now, I particularly like frames value for that.

355
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,600
So I think that must be the only problem that we have.

356
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,300
So that's my suspicion.

357
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm going to see if I'm correct about that.

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,300
So let's take a look.

359
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,700
So that's going to be in debug bra.

360
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Element actually over here.

361
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,300
So in debug draw element, we passed the debug ID in.

362
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,200
So it's going to be created right here and if it's created from the

363
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,800
link, it feels like the link should be correct though, right?

364
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
Because that should be stable the entire time there.

365
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Should, it should not be recreating the link over and over and over

366
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,800
again because it was we'd be seeing the tree change.

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,500
No.

368
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,200
So that seems not quite logical to me.

369
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,800
I can't say I have any idea.

370
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,700
Why that would be true.

371
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,600
Hmm.

372
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,300
Hmm.

373
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
Let's check this one more time.

374
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
Oops, didn't quite need to go there yet.

375
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,000
So, Global rendering type is, in fact, the one we were talking about.

376
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,200
And what I would like to do here is, I'd like to just go ahead and

377
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,800
stop on this multiple times to see if the debug ID itself changes,

378
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,900
right?

379
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,800
And so, what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to

380
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Going to oops not that.

381
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm going to open up stored event, I'm sorry not start event.

382
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm gonna open up.

383
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
Debug State hot interaction.

384
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,400
And I just want to see if this value.

385
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,900
In fact, I guess I can just even just look at one specific value

386
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,200
because I only care about generic.

387
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,600
So I'm just going to look at that value and I want to see if over time

388
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
that value is changing for some reason.

389
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,400
So if I come in here and I'm now clearly over this one, I want to see

390
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,600
what I get in here.

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,600
So it is changing every time.

392
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,900
So now I'm going to walk back up the chain a little bit and I want to

393
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,800
see why that's happening.

394
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,400
So in draw main menu, where I make the debug ID to begin with, I would

395
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
like to know.

396
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,400
I want to see what I want to verify.

397
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,800
That that's happening here as well, right?

398
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,000
So yeah, let's stop in here.

399
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's take a look at debug ID.

400
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,600
So what we should here, see here.

401
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,500
Is that a deal?

402
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,500
I d.

403
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,100
Oh wait.

404
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,700
Wait wait, wait.

405
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,100
Wait.

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Debug ideas, not where generic comes from, right, right?

407
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,700
so, when we actually go through here,

408
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,800
And draw the value.

409
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,800
Where's that at?

410
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,200
I scrolled right by you, didn't I?

411
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,800
Sorry man in the tree right, there we go.

412
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,700
So when we come through here, when we make the item interaction, this

413
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,000
is actually the problem.

414
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,900
So that is the problem.

415
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,400
I for some reason, forgot, I was like, oh, right the debug idea was

416
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,600
wrong.

417
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,900
No, no.

418
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,400
The debug idea was right.

419
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
It was the generic that was wrong.

420
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,700
So it's this.

421
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
And so this has to be, we don't actually want this to be the event

422
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,900
value because that's changed over time.

423
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
We want this to be the

424
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
And value, right?

425
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,300
And so what has to happen is the element that we're talking about.

426
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,000
When we call debug draw event, we want to know what that one actually

427
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
is, so that we can use it and talk about it.

428
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,800
So that was really all that that had to happen.

429
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
So it was exactly what I thought it was.

430
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,700
I just tricked myself into not seeing it.

431
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,200
So, this is like, the element that we're in, and so, then when we come

432
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
here, we can just say, like, oh, it's in element, right?

433
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Like that.

434
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,500
So now we have to take a look at anywhere that we might do a draw

435
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,100
event.

436
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,800
And yeah, that's true.

437
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,000
We would have to change event interaction.

438
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,400
We need this to be like element interaction.

439
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,500
Oops.

440
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,000
And then when this person calls, we need to pass what?

441
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
That element actually was.

442
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,600
So then event interaction, we could still leave a round, although it's

443
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,300
unclear that we ever actually want to have that happen.

444
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
I guess I should check to see if anyone else is calling it.

445
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,000
Somebody is calling it.

446
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,000
Just to tear off a bitmap for some reason.

447
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,900
All right, fine.

448
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm going to still change that to an element interaction.

449
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,500
Cuz I think that's usually what we actually want, that makes sense.

450
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,800
So event interaction.

451
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,600
I think we're just going to say that that is not a thing.

452
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,500
Actually and it's only element interactions at the moment.

453
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,900
And maybe that's like something we would that I'm missing why we might

454
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,400
want something else, but for the moment I think we only want to talk

455
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,500
about interactions that happen for an element and then which one of

456
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,200
those you're operating on is going to be picked out for you based on

457
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
the situation because otherwise you could never edit element.

458
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,600
You're always like targeting an element that's older or something.

459
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,500
Right?

460
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,100
So yeah.

461
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,400
So

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
And interactions.

463
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,200
That's all fine.

464
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,300
So now, this is just going to be like, you know, element

465
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,200
Element like that and and that should be fine.

466
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,000
All right.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So in here, when we're checking the hot interaction for the type, this

468
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
would have to be an element.

469
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
And I don't really remember the Ridiculousness.

470
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,800
It's in here for storing these guys, it's pretty crazy if I remember

471
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,400
correctly because we've got a store all kinds of things.

472
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:09,900
So yeah, in here we have like most recent event that that is a pointer

473
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,000
chain for you, right there.

474
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,800
Sorry, there we go.

475
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Cross cannot access the file because it would be all right event.

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,600
And so to get the when we do a toggle value, presumably we're talking

477
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,500
about the most recent one, right?

478
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,100
I mean, I guess, I don't know that we always want the most recent one,

479
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,200
but it seems like what we would normally do.

480
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,100
And same here.

481
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay, so I think that is all we really needed in theory, anyway.

482
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,400
Of course, it looks like maybe event doesn't always have to be that.

483
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:30,300
Like this debug interaction might not actually have one of these, I

484
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,900
don't really know.

485
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,400
So it assumes up front that we

486
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:44,300
Yeah, we would need to say, you know, if this thing was actually

487
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,700
there, then do it.

488
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,400
Otherwise, you know, we don't actually want to try and grab that out

489
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,900
because we don't know if we even have that kind of an interaction, I

490
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,200
guess.

491
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,000
All right.

492
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,100
So that's good.

493
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:08,200
Now at least that's working properly and I don't know if there was

494
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,500
also this thing and I don't know if we can drag, it looks like that

495
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,900
Dragon is not working either.

496
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,400
So I would like to I thought we had some stuff for that.

497
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,600
Yeah like this thing right here.

498
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,200
So what we should probably do here is just to stem it Systema.

499
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,600
Sighs systematized we

500
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,200
Already like fixed this thing and you can see how it works here,

501
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,500
right?

502
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,500
You do this edit event, edit event grid nonsense, right?

503
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,400
So we probably don't want to have that all over the place, so we

504
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:46,500
probably just want to do something like, you know, debug edit Event

505
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,300
Event.

506
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,300
So we just, you know, we know that thing is going to get edited and

507
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,500
then it creates that that edit operation for it and we could do that.

508
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,900
You know, we could even do that sort of like that, you know, at the

509
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,600
after we do the toggle value for the event.

510
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,100
So that anyone else who's in here, we don't have to write it the same

511
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:13,900
way or maybe we'll call this like debug Mark edited event.

512
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,600
Like that.

513
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:19,800
So yeah.

514
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,900
Let's go ahead and put this in here.

515
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,600
Debug Mark, edited event, you know what edited only has like one t,

516
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,600
pretty sure about that.

517
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,300
So if I'm going to mark one of these, I just need to have the event

518
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,900
itself.

519
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,500
It looks like that's actually it, right?

520
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh.

521
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,700
And the debug state.

522
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
And I think I know why.

523
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
The indentations not working there.

524
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,800
Nobody knows, but nobody cares.

525
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,800
So that's all good and then if we drag a value we probably want to

526
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:15,900
edit the value and we could actually make this a little safer by

527
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,200
saying like oh if you pass it annul we just won't do anything which is

528
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,300
also good.

529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,000
Yeah.

530
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,100
And what are you complaining about?

531
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,700
Left of original grid.

532
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,500
Must Point get them at a venture far not found.

533
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah.

534
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,600
Well you know why?

535
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,700
That's because the pre deck needs to be right there.

536
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,700
Mark, edited Valley events, rather, you stick a debug state.

537
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,400
And that's it.

538
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:06,900
So now I think this probably work, if I turn on the debug camera, I

539
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,100
should be able to like

540
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,100
Zoom around.

541
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,400
Right so that's pretty good.

542
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,600
So that's all fine.

543
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,700
So now we can edit those values live and that's like suppose good.

544
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,500
I mean, who knows.

545
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,000
So all of that stuff works good now and I guess technically to we

546
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,100
could take a look to see whether we can re-enable some of the other.

547
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,300
Oh my God, I always forget that that's going to happen when I click on

548
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,800
that.

549
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
But that's exactly what happens when I click on that.

550
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,300
all right, so yeah, turns out

551
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,300
This dude is like got a lot of heads coming up all over the place that

552
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:54,800
was not my intention so I sorry about the heads that they're just

553
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
they're just kind of doing their thing.

554
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,400
Okay, so I think that is all I really want to do with that.

555
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,000
What we should probably focus on now is actually getting some of these

556
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
other things working properly.

557
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,500
So, let's I, I want to see where we're at with that are values the

558
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,600
tear off values.

559
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,400
I don't really care too much about them, but I just want to see where

560
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,700
where they why they are currently disabled and just see if there's

561
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,900
anything in particular.

562
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,400
So here's here's an example of where the tear value stuff happens.

563
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,200
I don't know if this actually works.

564
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,000
I don't even remember how terrible he was working.

565
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,800
The first place.

566
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,200
Is it right Mouse button?

567
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I think possibly

568
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,500
I've no idea none whatsoever but I'm going to go ahead and re-enable

569
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,800
it and just see what happens because I mean I don't have anything

570
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
better to do so there we go.

571
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,200
So if I want to do at are value, it looks like

572
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
it looks like what happened here was.

573
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,200
There's a hot

574
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,800
And that happens.

575
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Well you know what, I should probably look to see what we're storing

576
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
for tear values.

577
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,900
Let's see.

578
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,000
Debug interaction tear value and tear value.

579
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
It's an element interaction.

580
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,200
So that the value parameter is is a debug element.

581
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,500
And that I don't know if that helps us or not.

582
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,700
Probably not, let's find out.

583
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,500
yeah, so if we tear off a debug element,

584
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,800
That doesn't really help because tearing off a debug element.

585
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,500
Doesn't tell us what the tree looked like, at that point.

586
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,700
So really what we want to tear off at that point, if we're going to

587
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
process, something that was torn off.

588
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,900
It would have to be one of those links.

589
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:48,600
Right.

590
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,700
We need to be a link interaction and I don't know if we get the link

591
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,200
down here, we don't really I guess.

592
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,700
But that's where that would have to happen.

593
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,600
Looks like that's the only place that that happens.

594
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,199
Yeah, so I don't think we want this here on the bitmap anyway, that

595
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:25,100
doesn't seem like a particularly useful thing to do anyway so I don't

596
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,500
know what it should be.

597
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
I have no idea what the default interaction should be.

598
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,900
So I'm just going to leave that blank for now.

599
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,800
And then I'm going to go ahead and well, you know what, you can just

600
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,800
pass the item interaction, which I mean, it's automatically variable,

601
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,699
which is whatever it's going to do, right?

602
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,699
And then in here,

603
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
This chair interaction.

604
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm going to actually grab that and I'm going to move that down for

605
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
when we're doing the main menu.

606
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:57,900
And so in the main menu, what I would say is that when we do this item

607
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,000
interaction here,

608
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,900
that I am interaction is built off the

609
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,000
off the link.

610
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,100
Right?

611
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,000
So it's a toggle expansion, it's built off the link.

612
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,000
And so I think what I would want to do is say, okay, if

613
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,300
If you do at are expansion, that are Terror.

614
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,400
Yeah.

615
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,500
if you do a toggle expansion,

616
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Then it's always doing this thing but the view, right?

617
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,800
But if we try to do a tear off, what I want to do is I want to make

618
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,000
sure that the parameter to that or what we would tear off, what we

619
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,700
would tear off.

620
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,200
I want to be to me.

621
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
What we would tear off.

622
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,500
I want to be a link and so the hot interaction variable there.

623
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,300
I need to figure out some way.

624
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,700
That that could be set to the tree.

625
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,100
So let's take a look see here.

626
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,400
I want debug state so you can see here.

627
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
We've got debug interactions stacked up.

628
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,500
These would have they would never have a debug link.

629
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,800
So how what is actually getting passed for that when we're going down

630
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,000
here?

631
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So we've got the toggle expansion and we pass the ID.

632
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,500
So it's just an idea, it doesn't take any additional information.

633
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,600
I feel like we would want that to be a link interaction because that's

634
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,000
what we're actually hovering over at that time is a link, right?

635
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,800
So and in either case, you sort of, there is a link to be had

636
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,100
If that makes sense.

637
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,800
So it seems like we want some way of having that that link get pushed

638
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,400
on there.

639
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,100
And perhaps I'm going to go ahead and see where that alt interaction.

640
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,000
Thing happens.

641
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,900
How do we set up?

642
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
We set that up.

643
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,100
Alt you.

644
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:24,500
I

645
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,000
so I think what I want to do is I think I want to just actually change

646
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,200
the way this is being handled so that alt UI is just set and then we

647
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,300
we don't handle the change in interaction.

648
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,700
Here we handle the change in interaction up top, right?

649
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,300
So we would say like where we're actually doing the processing so we

650
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,800
would do something like all you.

651
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,100
I would come in here and then when we do debug

652
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,800
When we actually do our debug processing before we start we set all UI

653
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,500
to that value.

654
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,600
So you know debug interact in here, right before we actually do

655
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
anything else.

656
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,000
We like set that stuff up so we just say like oh yeah all you I

657
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,900
Is set based on whatever happened with the right Mouse button, that

658
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:29,100
makes sense and and then we don't have that happening anywhere else,

659
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,000
right?

660
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So

661
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,000
See.

662
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,400
Where is that actually used.

663
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Begin interact if alt you I set the only place.

664
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Yeah so I'm just going to get rid of that.

665
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Entirely.

666
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,500
And I think I can get rid of it here, too.

667
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,100
so all you, I input Mouse buttons ended down

668
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Don't care about that.

669
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,200
I don't care about this.

670
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,800
Alright, so now, I think we're sort of where we need to be.

671
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,500
So if we do a terror value then, what we need to do is create one of

672
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,600
those variable groups, right?

673
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,000
So, we've got handmade debug dots groupie, we've got ad or something

674
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,600
like, debug ad group.

675
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,700
I remember.

676
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
What it's called.

677
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,500
Add tree.

678
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,700
So we need to do both of these.

679
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,100
So, we've got a dead tree, add tree.

680
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,500
Looks like it would still work.

681
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,800
So we just need to do.

682
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:54,900
See here.

683
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,300
We just need to do.

684
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,700
However, you add things to a group or create a new group, rather.

685
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,800
No, where is it?

686
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,400
It should not be this hard.

687
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
There it is.

688
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,700
Create variable group is what I actually wanted.

689
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,700
So create variable group.

690
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,300
Like so returns a debug variable Group, which is, you know, pretty

691
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,900
sensical if you ask me, and then we've got the debug state, which is

692
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,400
fine.

693
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:59,400
We have what we're going to name it and I don't really know what we're

694
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,300
gonna name it.

695
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,500
So I'll just call it for the moment, I guess, you know?

696
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Name.

697
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,300
Equals something.

698
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,800
So if I was to do that, then I can just pass the name temporarily and

699
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,600
I can say that whatever the size of the name is is what we pass.

700
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,200
And we'll figure out what to name it in a second I guess because I'm

701
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,700
not sure.

702
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,100
So then we will add an element to the group, right?

703
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,900
Add element to group and we need to, well, actually, I guess what.

704
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,000
We need to do here is let's just do that.

705
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,100
What we really want to do here is actually clone, right?

706
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,100
So what I really want to do is I want to do like cologne

707
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,300
Variable group.

708
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,200
You know what I'm saying?

709
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,700
So that's probably going to be something that I write right now.

710
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,200
Then we would add the tree using the route group that we made and then

711
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,300
I don't really know if there's anything else that we actually need to

712
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,600
do.

713
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,800
I don't know why we wouldn't be passing, why would we pass?

714
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,200
Like why wouldn't we just pass the mouse key right here?

715
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,800
I don't know why.

716
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,000
So I'm just going to do that.

717
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,200
That seems like the most logical thing to do and then

718
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,600
We're going to create a move operation.

719
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,000
So let's see where we're at with this create variable group,

720
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
identifier, not found because these are all below here.

721
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
I suppose create variable group.

722
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,100
There we go.

723
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,300
So if that's true.

724
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,200
There we go.

725
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,600
I probably need to sort of copy these in here.

726
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,600
So create variable group.

727
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,600
Go.

728
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,000
We'll have our clone variable group.

729
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,600
and yeah, so that would take

730
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,700
first thing to clone from,

731
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,000
Seems like it.

732
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,200
And that's, that's about it.

733
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,200
Pig.

734
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,200
All right, so we don't really care about this just yet.

735
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
So I'm going to go ahead and pause that whole situation.

736
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,000
I'm going to run this and see because I don't actually know.

737
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,400
We're going to have to figure out a way to actually test the fact that

738
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,600
we even can clone.

739
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
So the idea is we're going to right-click on this thing and move it

740
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,100
over, right?

741
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,500
And so to do that, what I want to do is say, oh okay, when we're doing

742
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,000
debug draw event,

743
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,800
if we wanted to have or actually I guess it's actually in here when

744
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,900
we're doing this interaction here where we do toggle expansion, what

745
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:35,300
we can do is say like oh actually you know what if

746
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,700
We're using the alternate UI for this thing.

747
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,100
Then what we actually want to do is instead of item.

748
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,900
Interaction being what this one is.

749
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,800
We'll do a different one.

750
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,100
That's actually going to be.

751
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,700
Tear value.

752
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,300
It really should be called territory or something like that, but

753
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,800
that's beside the point.

754
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,900
So then we just overwrite the item interaction and then we still use

755
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,800
it right?

756
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,700
And so debug ID interaction it's actually going to be a debug link

757
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,100
interaction and we're going to pass the link that we are and that is

758
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,500
what I actually was trying to set us up for to do here.

759
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,500
So in here this would be like oh we're passing, you know?

760
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,000
One of those.

761
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,800
And so when we have like debug ID, interaction or whatever,

762
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,700
We can just make one of these.

763
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,400
Oops.

764
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,200
And that's all I was trying to do.

765
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,600
Is it what is it called?

766
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,800
Its debug like variable link.

767
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,100
Debug variable link.

768
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,000
and so if we do one of those, then when we do the tear value now, are

769
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,900
the actual value that we get,

770
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,400
So when we do this, the actual value that we get in here, as the

771
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,300
parameter is the the group that we would want to clone now, we don't

772
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,600
actually have to do that just quite yet because we should be able to

773
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,500
get this working without actually cloning the tree first.

774
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,000
But I want to, I got to get that part to work.

775
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,300
So, let me take a look at Tara value here, and let me set a break

776
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,800
point, so I can do to me.

777
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:58,000
Am I set a breakpoint so I can see if we ever successfully do it.

778
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,900
And you can see, we're not actually getting any tearing there.

779
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,200
So now I'm going to check to see whether we actually ever go through

780
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,000
this path, so they all uipath and we do.

781
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,000
So, you can see a setting this thing to tear value here.

782
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,400
And then we go through and set that as the default interaction

783
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,100
potentially.

784
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,100
Let's find out if that actually happens.

785
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,600
So it looks like the problem is actually not that there's anything

786
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,200
wrong here.

787
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,800
It's that we're not.

788
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh, you know what?

789
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,700
I forgot.

790
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,200
We never really implemented.

791
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,300
It any kind of alternate, any kind, of course, clicking for it.

792
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,400
So it's actually you hold down the right button and then click the

793
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,800
left button.

794
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,700
So it does work.

795
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,800
That was so weird.

796
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,800
You I think so it is working the way.

797
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,700
To work, so that's good.

798
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:10,100
So yeah, so now I can drag out new ones of these which is good.

799
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,500
And so now if I just clone that tree I should be able to do what I

800
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,500
wanted to do before with the tree cloning right now.

801
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,000
What I don't know is whether that should be drawing a name or not.

802
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,800
I would have thought that it would but it might be that we never draw

803
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,400
the initial name because you know, like this guy doesn't have an

804
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,600
official name for example.

805
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,300
And so we'll have to just go double-check how that's supposed to work

806
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,500
as we're cleaning this out.

807
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:36,800
All right.

808
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,700
So what we actually want to do here is say okay, well there's actually

809
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,000
a thing called clone variable group as well.

810
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,100
And clone variable group, we'll just do whatever create variable

811
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,500
group, where is that?

812
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,200
Actually create variable group.

813
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,800
There we go.

814
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,600
So if we have internal,

815
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,400
Debug variable group.

816
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,800
And we say clone variable

817
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,000
Group.

818
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,600
What I do not know.

819
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,400
Is that any of this stuff works?

820
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,900
So let's just go take a look because we got a page it back into the

821
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,500
brain, right?

822
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
So let's see.

823
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,800
We've got debug

824
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,900
variable link.

825
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,100
So debug variable group is literally just a title and a linked list

826
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,400
and a debug variable link is like one Link in that chain.

827
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,400
so we might even say that we always clone groups as opposed to

828
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,500
individual values, but I don't know,

829
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,500
Let's just let's just see what we want to do.

830
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,900
So, excuse me, so what we would do, if we pass the variable link here,

831
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,700
if we pass instead of a group,

832
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,600
I guess we would need to know whether we were supposed to Cologne.

833
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,000
Yeah, I'm just not I'm not totally sure.

834
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,200
Whether we would always be cloning a group, whether it's clone

835
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:26,900
individual value.

836
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,300
So if we pass like I guess if we just passed a value which is be

837
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:32,700
about.

838
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,100
So I guess, you know, this is just the source, right?

839
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,200
And we would do something like,

840
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,700
Well.

841
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:52,700
Probably want to do this for cursive like debug variable link.

842
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,500
Dest equals add element to group.

843
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,000
And we do like, whatever the desk group is.

844
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,000
And then we'd add the source.

845
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,600
So, we'd add an element.

846
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,000
and then we would say if the source itself was a group

847
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,700
Then what we would want to do, is create a new group.

848
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,800
To hold those.

849
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,200
And we would just have it point to the exact same stuff, right?

850
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:47,900
So whatever the source is information was and right, so it's literally

851
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,500
just

852
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,900
Whatever the source has children, dot name length is and the sources

853
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,800
children dot name are.

854
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,100
That's the subgroup.

855
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,000
And then we would just do a for I Loop here through all of the

856
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,900
children that it actually has and adding them to the subgroup.

857
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,900
So I guess it's actually clone variable link is this function it would

858
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,800
take what the group is.

859
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,900
And then we are clone variable group call would actually create a

860
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,400
group and then call this for that it into that group.

861
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,100
So we would just say all right we got the subgroup here.

862
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,400
We're going to say Source children.

863
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:39,900
Hmm.

864
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:40,800
Was it first?

865
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,000
Whereas it should be like a first next kind of thing.

866
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:44,900
Sentinel

867
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,300
Sentinel next.

868
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:55,300
So we would just say, Okay, debug variable link child equals the

869
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,400
Sentinels.

870
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,400
Next pointer, know why I have not put arrows on this.

871
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,500
Okay, we would say as long as the child is not equal to the Sentinel

872
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,200
we're good.

873
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,900
And then we just chase the next pointer the whole time.

874
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
We clone.

875
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
Because we care.

876
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,400
That child and off we go.

877
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,100
So then

878
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,800
We return, the link, I guess there is no real reason to have this

879
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,500
thing.

880
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,300
Well, I guess because, yeah, we can't just create this freestanding.

881
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,200
All right, so that's fine.

882
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:57,900
It's not exactly.

883
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,600
Probably, if not probably how I would

884
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,500
Preferred it precisely but it's not really any real reason to change

885
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:05,600
it.

886
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,100
So I'll leave it like this for now.

887
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,400
So that would clone one of these variable links and return it.

888
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And then we could also do the same thing.

889
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,600
For clone variable group.

890
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,500
And in that case we would just say like okay for cloning from one of

891
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,100
these then we need to create a variable group.

892
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,800
We don't know what the name is.

893
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,400
Maybe we'll just call it cloned.

894
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
So there's a name, it's cloned.

895
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,500
We probably want to push that string on so that if we go across

896
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,100
reloads it doesn't pose a problem.

897
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,000
So I would probably want to do a push string.

898
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,200
For this actually.

899
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,600
Right where we would say like okay, debug State debugger Arena.

900
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,200
You know, go ahead and save that name.

901
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,500
So that we don't have a constant string that would get unloaded with

902
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,900
the dll or anything like that.

903
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,200
Again, that's just a support the hot code reloading.

904
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,100
And after I create that variable group, then I will close call clone

905
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,800
variable link and I'll just clone the link that were passed into that

906
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,200
group.

907
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,300
It is true that does not take 0 parameters.

908
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,500
So we would need to pass the debug State and then the link that we

909
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,900
actually want is the is the actual parameter to our hot interaction.

910
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,300
So it'd be hot interaction, dot link.

911
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,200
Oh, not hot interaction, actually just regular interaction, right?

912
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,300
Yeah.

913
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,600
I don't want to group connector for three from dear a link to debug

914
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:25,500
element that seems fair.

915
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,500
So basically what that's saying is that when we clone a variable link,

916
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,100
we need to pass the element, which is fine because I believe it just

917
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,300
has an element in it, right?

918
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:32,900
Yeah.

919
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,800
All right, so I don't know if this works so that did not work at all.

920
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:44,600
What did that?

921
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,800
Just say, hold on a second.

922
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,300
Show me your tube.

923
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Show me that message again.

924
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,000
Access violation.

925
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Reading location element.

926
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,700
Okay.

927
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,500
So, that did not work well at all to say, the

928
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Next.

929
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh I know why because we do all these, add two groups but we never

930
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,300
actually copied the data for the variable.

931
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,200
So that's kind of stupid, right?

932
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,100
So we probably want to do that.

933
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,900
That was a mistake, right?

934
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,000
So we get back that variable link but it doesn't actually have

935
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,400
Well, no, that's not true.

936
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,200
It should have had some stuff in it, right?

937
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,500
It should have copied because all that debug like, does is just it

938
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,400
only contains a pointer to the element, so that actually should have

939
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:33,900
been fine.

940
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:40,800
I would think, let's find out debug, it's variable link.

941
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,600
So, it just has the point to the elements.

942
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,500
So I feel like that should just work, right?

943
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:02,400
That should just work.

944
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,400
We clone the element, everything's fine.

945
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,000
So it would only be if the element pointer was bogus which I suppose

946
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,600
it could be.

947
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,800
I guess I should verify that.

948
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,400
When we do our Terror value that it's actually the correct pointer

949
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:15,900
here.

950
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,000
We also don't care about that string anymore.

951
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,600
So let's see if we do a clone very group on the hot interaction link.

952
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:29,200
So does that actually what gets set timer action, tear value?

953
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,200
It does we pass an actual debug link, right?

954
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,800
And that is a debug variable.

955
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,700
Link.

956
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:38,800
Yeah, so I don't know.

957
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,000
All right, so let's take a little bit closer.

958
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,500
Look here.

959
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,100
Excuse me, by the way, I can still hear helicopters outside.

960
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,600
So I'm assuming the guy in the tree is still in the tree.

961
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,100
And I guess I'm almost up time because we started at 20.

962
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:00,400
So I'm just going to see if I can quick, do this, and then and then

963
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,000
we'll stop.

964
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,000
All right, so let's do clone variable group.

965
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,700
And I wanted to see what ends up happening here.

966
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,800
So, if we do this I want to see what we ended up with four result.

967
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,200
So here is the variable group.

968
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,800
It's got the name, we gave it.

969
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Here's the Sentinel and you know, it's got some stuff in it.

970
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,100
And it looks like element is always zero.

971
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,000
So why is that?

972
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,600
Because I don't think those are all.

973
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,300
They don't have children or Elements which doesn't make a lot of

974
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:45,800
sense.

975
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:53,300
So the source has a children pointer there and then the children

976
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:59,000
Oh, whoops, because that's the Sentinel.

977
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,400
No, it's not.

978
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,800
Never mind.

979
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,300
So there's essential there.

980
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,900
Look at the next pointer.

981
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,000
So that's got an element pointer.

982
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,700
So, why is our elements?

983
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,600
So I just messed up the copy, that's the only problem.

984
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,200
So let's take a look.

985
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,300
We jump in here.

986
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,900
Push the string we call create variable group that does what it does?

987
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,500
We clone our variable link.

988
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,500
So we come in here and we want to add this element.

989
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:33,700
Huh.

990
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,300
Oh wait, but that's fine.

991
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,400
That part's actually fine.

992
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,400
So this is

993
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,400
this is totally fine because when we add an element and there is no

994
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,400
element, that's actually fine.

995
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,200
It just creates a thing.

996
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,500
That has two nulls.

997
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,900
It looks at their Source children.

998
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:07,900
There are secretes the subgroup it just never sets the subgroup,

999
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,500
that's the problem.

1000
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,300
So when we do clone variable link,

1001
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,400
I'm sorry clone variable yeah but variable link then in here that

1002
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,100
subgroup it should actually be deaf children.

1003
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,700
Is where that subgroup gets assigned, right?

1004
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:28,700
And so

1005
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,900
that is actually what we should have been doing this whole time.

1006
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,400
I think that's at least problem, eh.

1007
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,400
We'll see about problem, B's C's and D's.

1008
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,900
So now if we grab simulation out here, now we've got the ability to

1009
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,800
sort of like grab out parts of this.

1010
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,200
I assume we can grab out individual pieces.

1011
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,200
Yeah.

1012
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,300
And so now we're pretty close.

1013
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,300
I mean that's pretty great actually because if you think about how

1014
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,800
many things this is now handling, it's actually storing UI state for

1015
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,100
all of these as well.

1016
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,100
Totally separately which is kind of cool and without ever actually

1017
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,700
Using any more space than it would need to.

1018
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,200
Because if you never actually touch one, it never stores any UI for

1019
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:15,600
it.

1020
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,900
So that's kind of nice as well.

1021
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,300
And it looks like everything is working properly.

1022
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,100
So for example, if I wanted, you know, I could drag out this entity

1023
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,100
and leave this entity getting viewed here, right?

1024
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,100
Don't know why.

1025
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,200
It doesn't have a little.

1026
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,900
I'm not sure I understand when it gets like these guys.

1027
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,700
Don't have there with those little.

1028
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,100
I guess they do have them.

1029
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,400
You can't see them, we got to, we got to work on our rendering here, a

1030
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,300
little bit, right?

1031
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:56,100
So, yeah, we can, like, drag out something and all of this stuff works

1032
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:56,500
properly.

1033
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,900
So we really just need to clean up.

1034
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Rendering and I don't know why bitmaps networks.

1035
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
We should look at that as well.

1036
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,500
I think we're in good shape because now we can make these things

1037
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,400
happen to where we like, you know,

1038
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,200
Where are we?

1039
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,100
You know, we can like pin things and places.

1040
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,800
If we want like a particular heads-up thing to be happening so that we

1041
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,500
don't need to like always go down.

1042
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,900
Like if we always know that we're working on something in particular,

1043
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:29,400
you know, we just want a particular value like,

1044
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,700
You know like this or whatever to be available to us, we can always

1045
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,000
get it right?

1046
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,900
And that's kind of nice and look the Highlight works properly, right?

1047
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,700
It doesn't highlight this guy instead of this guy even though you know

1048
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,900
soon as its source of this is pretty good.

1049
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,300
I'd say we're I say we're pretty good shape.

1050
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,700
I say we're handling most of our things properly so now we just got to

1051
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:55,500
work on a rendering.

1052
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,300
We got a drawer, our profile in here.

1053
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,500
We've got to draw this stuff a little bit better.

1054
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,700
Make it not look so janky

1055
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,400
And I think we're in good.

1056
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,500
We're good shape here.

1057
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,500
You happy about that.

1058
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,900
All right, we will go to the most briefest of brief qas here.

1059
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,600
Since we only have a few minutes left started pretty late today.

1060
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,700
Thank you diabetics 17 for telling me.

1061
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,300
I figured the dubis up in the tree gets, I can hear the helicopters,

1062
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:58,700
but as I see the guy, I actually thought it was a binary tree and that

1063
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,300
he would be on the ground if he gets to the leaves.

1064
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,300
I see.

1065
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,700
No questions.

1066
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,100
No questions.

1067
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,700
We can we can turn in

1068
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,600
Dude, in basement one.

1069
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,700
What is the debug code to other code ratio?

1070
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:48,400
Now, you know, it's probably not since we since we the amount of time

1071
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,200
spent on the debug code is pretty high.

1072
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,600
And that's because I decided to do the debug code as the thing to

1073
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,300
like, go through a bunch of Explorations and pick one, right?

1074
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,400
so it took a lot of time compared to the other code and that was sort

1075
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,200
of on purpose but as to how much coded actually is

1076
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,800
I don't know if it's that much code total compared to everything else.

1077
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,200
I don't really know how to make this thing do that.

1078
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,600
So if that's

1079
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,200
I don't know what that's telling us but that's telling us something.

1080
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,700
And then if I say handmade like debug dot star,

1081
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,000
Does that work?

1082
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:43,500
and there's interface as well, so maybe can I do

1083
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:54,200
Okay that all right so it's 2,200 lines of a 1600.

1084
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,600
I mean 16 16 thousand line program

1085
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,100
So, it's an eight, an eighth of the code.

1086
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I think it took significantly more than eighth of the time if that

1087
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,200
makes sense.

1088
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,300
Let's see.

1089
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:25,400
What happens if you try to modify a dynamic variable, like the player

1090
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,200
position?

1091
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,200
So the problem with that right now is, I don't think we have any

1092
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,800
editors for V, 2 variables for vectors.

1093
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:41,900
Otherwise, I think it would just move the player because it's just

1094
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,200
over writing the value.

1095
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,700
I don't actually know if there are any values in here.

1096
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,500
Well, we could see, I don't know, let me find out.

1097
01:07:54,500 --> 01:08:03,000
So, if I go into the game and I look at the simulation in a day, if I

1098
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,900
was to take facing direction and change it,

1099
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,300
Could see what happens there.

1100
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:10,900
Oh wait.

1101
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:12,100
I have to select them first.

1102
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,500
Yeah, so I think you can just edit any values now at this point,

1103
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,100
right?

1104
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,200
Like that just works.

1105
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:28,300
So I don't know what else we would do here necessarily but

1106
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,899
I don't think walkable height does anything.

1107
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,500
So, the problem is mostly we haven't written any editors for these

1108
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,300
like we need a little Vector editor or something, but otherwise it's

1109
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:39,700
fine.

1110
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:42,899
so,

1111
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,899
in Clone variable group, size of name - one, should this be the string

1112
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:52,200
length?

1113
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,399
Not the size of pointer minus one.

1114
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,800
So, let me see what?

1115
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,200
You're talking about.

1116
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:12,800
Oh, whoops.

1117
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,500
Yeah, you are correct.

1118
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,500
We didn't fix this code from before.

1119
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,800
I guess there's no, it'd be nice.

1120
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,500
If there was a way to get back, how much it pushed on, but

1121
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:30,899
unfortunately, unfortunately, we didn't do that, right?

1122
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:34,100
Because it's kind of wasteful to call this again, because we don't, we

1123
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:35,600
already would have known that.

1124
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,500
Right?

1125
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,200
Because it had to push the string on in the first place.

1126
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:42,800
Every so often we get that texture.

1127
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,600
Download problem.

1128
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,600
I'm hoping that we can fix that like that when the textures don't want

1129
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,300
to don't download when we do a run, I'm hoping that if we change to

1130
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,300
doing just a single thread, since it turns out Nvidia doesn't actually

1131
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,700
optimize the multiple threads.

1132
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,200
More on that later, Juan's been doing some research on this.

1133
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,500
So yeah, doesn't we can't actually see any results of that obviously

1134
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,900
because at the moment we're not actually doing anything that would

1135
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,500
show that name but you are correct.

1136
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,500
You are correct.

1137
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:21,000
You just can't tell because at the moment we're not using it, but if

1138
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,400
we were to use it it would have happened.

1139
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,100
All right.

1140
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:37,400
All right, folks, I'm going to wrap it up.

1141
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,000
Dude.

1142
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,900
and,

1143
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:44,700
Close.

1144
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:46,500
All right.

1145
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,600
Thank you everyone for joining me, for another episode of handmade

1146
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:50,700
here.

1147
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,100
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1148
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,900
As always, if you want to follow along with the source code at home,

1149
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,400
you can always pre-order the game and it comes with a source code.

1150
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,000
So you can do just that if you want to ask questions, we have a forum

1151
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,300
site, you can go to to ask those questions.

1152
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,700
We also have patreon page, you can subscribe to if you want for 30

1153
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,400
series and a tweet bot, which treats the schedule at you if you want

1154
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,800
to catch a stream live, and if you do want to,

1155
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,300
If the stream live will be back here at 5:00 p.m.

1156
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:25,800
tomorrow pacific daylight time, assuming there is no man in the tree

1157
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,900
again tomorrow.

1158
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,700
Otherwise maybe we'll just have to call it a day because we all want

1159
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,600
to watch The Man in the tree.

1160
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,900
But tomorrow, I think we will probably want to start cleaning up our

1161
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,600
drawing of stuff so maybe we will go fix sort of the the drawing of

1162
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,400
those things.

1163
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:46,000
So they look a little nicer and are a little more interactable and

1164
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,800
then the other thing we can do is start working on that profile.

1165
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:48,200
L've you?

1166
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,300
I'd like to get that working so now that we sort of have the debug

1167
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,800
infrastructure I think settled down to the point where it's like, this

1168
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:54,800
is what it should be.

1169
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,300
We can start to go through that code and just clean up the actual

1170
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,800
implementation parts.

1171
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,700
Are, you know, sort of very zico dish.

1172
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,200
You know like that little nub that used for moving is super crappy,

1173
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:06,600
right?

1174
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,200
So so we'll just think of think about that a little bit and just clean

1175
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:15,000
that stuff up and then we can finally have some nice debug code and be

1176
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,400
done with it.

1177
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,200
I think don't know if there's really anything else we need their maybe

1178
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:23,100
diagramming, we could add a little diagramming support but I don't

1179
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:23,300
know.

1180
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,600
That's that's probably it.

1181
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,400
Thanks very much for joining me.

1182
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,000
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1183
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,600
5:00 p.m.

1184
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:29,900
Pacific Daylight time until then.

1185
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,200
Then have fun programming and I will see you guys on the internet.

1186
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,700
I'm going to go watch the guy in the tree.

1187
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,600
Take it easy, everyone.
