1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,300
Let us get things under control.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,600
Okay, this up.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
The only show that you can even conceive of watching.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,700
Really?

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,700
Like, if you really just had to in your mind's eye.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm sure you could Envision no other show that could ever even

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,100
possibly exist across.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,000
All of humanity, where people code an entire game from scratch with no

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
engine and no libraries, It seems impossible.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
How do they even do it?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,200
And

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,200
It night after night.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,600
It is getting done with, just me and a thousand of my closest friends.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,400
How long will we able to keep this up?

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,300
It's anyone's guess it's really.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,300
You never do know that surprises around every corner here at handmade

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,400
hero, but that is certainly not going to stop us.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,400
We are going to continue until we have our own very little happy

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,200
shining game that we can say we understood every last little bit of.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,400
And honestly, I think it's going pretty good so far.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
So why delay?

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,200
The inevitable?

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,400
Let's just dive right into it.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
If you have pre-ordered, the game, you should have gotten a link in

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,800
your email with a zip file Download Sort of thingy from send owl.

27
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,200
You can download the source code every night from that.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,900
You can also download the test assets if you download the source, it's

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,900
a zip file that has a ton of zip files in it.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,900
One for each day.

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
We are on day 52.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,700
So unzip day 51 and you put that in a directory and you will be where

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,100
I am.

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,200
So you will be like able to totally just scoot in the kind.

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,200
One of those bicyclists that drafts off another bicyclist, you can

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
just totally go for it.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,300
No headwind.

38
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,000
It's great.

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,100
All right.

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,200
So, let's see.

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,500
I was right.

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,400
I was rudely interrupted by the timer last time who told me that it

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,100
was the end of the stream?

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,200
Because I was right in the middle of making some major changes to the

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,700
code base.

46
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,500
And so what I want to do is go ahead and get back to those changes so

47
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,600
that we can emerge from the other side of our change tunnel in a

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,100
wonderful, you know, where the bright light is shining and the and the

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,200
unicorns Run free.

50
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,700
He and the Rainbows are, you know, gluten-free and everything else,

51
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,400
that happens.

52
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,000
All right.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,300
So what I was doing is, I was changing it.

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,600
I was starting to play around with changing things over.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,700
So that we would have entities divided up into pieces, where we have

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,900
ones that were sort of in the active, in the close range around the

57
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,100
player, one, or two screens away from the player.

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Those entities would be stored in sort of a high form and it read that

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
exists because we replace that yesterday.

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,200
With this.

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,400
Non-existent flag will be stored in this.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Hi Anthony.

63
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
And then we'd have low entity which are entities, that are being

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
stimulated, but are further away from you and are getting updated.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,300
Perhaps a lower resolution and then we have dormant entities which

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
didn't get updated at all.

67
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,000
And so, we were just kind of thinking of that through.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,100
Now, this is not set in stone by any means.

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
These probably won't be laid out like this in the in the final version

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
or anything like that, but I'm starting to play around because I want

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,300
this basic structure.

72
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,800
this basic concept anyway, the things get

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
Opt in and out of sort of the working set around the player.

74
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
And when they get mapped out, they're not, they're not totally dormant

75
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,500
automatically.

76
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,800
They could still be in sort of a low-frequency update pattern, and

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,700
that's where this would be.

78
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,900
So,

79
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,900
Let's see what's going on here.

80
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,400
I think we were sort of, in the process of we just it we were like

81
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,700
sort of in the process of making the change and we had to F0 a bunch

82
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,600
of stuff out.

83
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
So we have right now that move player.

84
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to go ahead and start working on some of this code that we

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,900
have zero doubt.

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,200
So when we do our move player code now, we really don't have to think

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,400
about the tile map anymore for the most part.

88
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,500
In fact, I really just don't even know if we're going to have to do

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,800
anything with this tile map anymore.

90
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Because really what we would have is we just we just have all of the

91
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,900
The tiles.

92
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,300
Just be moved into that set as well.

93
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,800
So, when we come in, I feel like all of those tiles would essentially

94
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,700
be sort of active entities.

95
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
And the reason I say that is because I don't know that we really want

96
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,600
tiles per se ever at all.

97
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,900
We just kind of want stuff that's following the tile map.

98
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,600
So, you know, if we have trees we probably just want the trees to be

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,700
in there and we want the player to collide against the trees and stuff

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,200
like that.

101
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,800
So,

102
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,100
I'm going to assume that we're actually just go ahead and I'm going to

103
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,200
just make that change while we're at it as well.

104
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
And so thinking about that.

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,100
I guess what I would say is our entity structures will also.

106
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Let's say, why not?

107
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,400
Let's just say their energy structures will also contain the actual

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
tiles in them as well.

109
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,700
And so, if I wanted to do that, I'd have to start thinking about how I

110
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
would do my Collision detection, right?

111
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,600
Because if I want to have

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,500
T on entity Collision detection, which obviously, we're going to have

113
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,600
to have, we would need some way of bending them.

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,800
So we do some kind of like spatial subdivision to keep things

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,300
obviously from getting too hectic.

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,700
And so that would start to be sort of a retiling of things as well.

117
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,500
And so that's kind of something to think about.

118
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,600
It's like it's kind of weird that we have all of these sort of

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,100
different structures and it does seem weird to have stuff like, oh,

120
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,400
well, you know, why do we have sort of these different levels of how

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
things get done?

122
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
But again, it all tends to shake out in the end and you have to kind

123
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,800
of go

124
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh, through a number of different iterations of how you structure,

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
things until you get something that you're very happy with.

126
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,400
And so it's all just it, you know, don't worry about it too much.

127
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,300
It's all just kind of the way things.

128
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,000
Go on the road to getting something that feels good and it's all about

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
kind of seeing how that goes.

130
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,300
So, I think what we'll do first is just assume will test every enemy

131
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,700
against every other entity, which is N squared, and really bad.

132
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,900
So that won't be able to be used in the final version, but we'll just

133
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,100
assume that's going to happen for now.

134
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,800
And so we'll assume that what we would say.

135
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Actually do is just have entities for all of those tiles.

136
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,400
And so, in the high entity struct, that would be kind of a good

137
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,900
argument against the way, the storm.

138
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,600
Intensity thing was working where we had it backed where we had them

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
in parallel arrays because we would want to basically have it so that

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
they the high entities could be brought.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,900
In from other places, so I don't know exactly how I want to.

142
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,300
I don't know exactly how I want to do that for right now, but

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
mmm.

144
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,900
Yeah, I'm just going to go ahead and do it.

145
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,600
We'll see what happens.

146
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,900
So if we were going to do that, right, then we no longer have to

147
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,200
figure out where we are in this space anymore.

148
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,500
We will have to do something like that.

149
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,000
When we actually want to do, we will have to do something where we

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
have some kind of spatial partition.

151
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,900
But for now, I'm going to ignore that.

152
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm going to say, let's just ignore this this stuff for now.

153
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Let's get rid of that there and the fact will get rid of this as well,

154
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:37,500
like.

155
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,000
So and I'm just going to go ahead and say, all right, for every

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,500
entity.

157
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,100
So we have, you know, an entity index or something.

158
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,600
Every entity in the world, right?

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:55,400
I am going to go ahead and check to see what's going on with with it

160
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,900
versus this other guy.

161
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,100
Okay.

162
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,700
Let's see here.

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Oh, and you know what, really that's something that happens in inside

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,100
here.

165
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,900
So this this is actually the iteration right there that we're looking

166
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,300
at.

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,900
So we've got, let's see.

168
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,500
There we go.

169
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
So I've got that there and then instead

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,700
Ed of actually having any of the tile stuff, we're just going to get

171
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
rid of all that, let's see there.

172
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,800
And then we're going to take a look here and we're going to see what

173
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,500
this does in here.

174
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,900
So basically what I'm doing is I'm changing this into an iteration

175
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,900
over the tile map.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm changing into iteration over the entities that are active in the

177
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,900
region, right?

178
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,700
So what I want to do is say okay, we still have this iteration.

179
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
We've got to go over some for each iteration.

180
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,400
We've got to see what entities we're going to collide with for right

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,500
now.

182
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,900
We're going to assume that we can collide with any of them to get.

183
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,100
Like I said, it's really an efficient so we don't really want to do

184
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
that but

185
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,500
We'll deal with that when we when we go through the second path.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
And since all the entities are defined to always be in the same space.

187
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,200
Now we can kind of get rid of all of this stuff entirely.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
That's just gone.

189
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,900
And now we are basically talking about just having to compute.

190
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,300
So, the diameter, the diameter width and height is basically going to

191
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,200
be pulled off of that other entity, right?

192
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
So, do we pass in?

193
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,700
We passed in the entity that we're using?

194
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
So now we just need to go ahead and get whatever the other entity is.

195
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,500
So essentially we want,

196
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Get the entity here.

197
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,900
So we've got an entity test entity and that's going to go ahead and

198
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,500
grab whatever.

199
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Whatever entity we're on.

200
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,100
And so when I grab that test annatee, then I'm going to be able to

201
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,000
test against its width and height, right?

202
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,500
And so that's going to be the dormant version.

203
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,700
Like so of that of our entity and it's going to be the dormant version

204
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,800
of the test entity as well.

205
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Right?

206
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
So again, we're just taking, we're doing exactly the same test that we

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,100
were doing before only now, instead of doing against the tile, we're

208
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,800
doing it again.

209
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,400
The.

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,900
Against the other entities.

211
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,200
So before we were looping over each tile.

212
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,500
Now, We're looping over each entity.

213
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,400
And again, we have with some Heights for the entities.

214
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
So we'll just use them.

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
That seems pretty easy.

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,700
And so then all we really need to do now is we need to come up with

217
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,400
what we were using before or relative.

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,300
Basically a relative position relative to, we got them in.

219
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,900
Quartermaster owner.

220
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,800
We have to have the relative position between the the tests entity and

221
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,500
our entity and that's obviously very easy to do.

222
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,500
That's just the high

223
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,300
And the test energy.

224
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,300
High P are the two positions.

225
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,900
So if I subtract those two, I'm going to get the relative position of

226
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,700
the player, right?

227
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,800
So I can just directly do that basically, right?

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,500
So that's the difference between those two and that is pretty much all

229
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,400
I need to do.

230
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,100
There will think that left again.

231
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,600
All this stuff is a little sloppy will come back through here and I

232
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
just want to kind of get everything laid out and think about it a

233
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,500
little bit as we go.

234
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,900
So again, looping over all the entities for each iteration of our

235
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,100
Collision solve and we're seeing what if we hit any of them?

236
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,200
And if we do then we just go ahead and and process the Collision like

237
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,900
we were doing before.

238
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,300
Okay, so when we come out of this, we should have a team in just like

239
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,600
we had before, we will update that team in by basically saying okay

240
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,600
The Entity position is going to have added to it.

241
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,500
Whatever that offset was the the velocity will obviously be clipped

242
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,800
like we wanted it to be so that it will no longer have any component.

243
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
If there was a wall that it hit, right?

244
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,700
And then the player Delta, which is the thing that we're updating.

245
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,500
By will also get clipped by it, and we will continue our Loop.

246
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,000
So that's about all that really needed to happen there.

247
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,800
The rest of this stuff can kind of work the same as it was before this

248
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,400
stuff is for going up and down, right?

249
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,500
And so I believe what we want to do here is say, okay when we're doing

250
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,300
our Collision, checking, obviously inside here.

251
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,600
We may find, we basically need now to have some concept,

252
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,000
of what our collisions actually do whether or not those collisions are

253
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,600
are things that actually stop the player or whether their collisions

254
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,700
that cause something to happen if that makes sense, so,

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,900
While we are iterating here, right?

256
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Every time we hit an entity, it would be nice to remember which

257
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,100
entity.

258
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,400
It was that we hit, right?

259
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,400
So if I have, for example, entity, or a hit entity Index, right?

260
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
And remember, zero is the null entity.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,700
In fact, I can always start all of my entities iterations, that one I

262
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,400
always forget that we have a null in today.

263
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,700
So if I have my hit into the index

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
Assuming that I have a hit entity.

265
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,300
It does kind of mean now that we could do something like okay if hit

266
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,800
entity Index, right if it's going, if something is going to happen

267
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,800
here, we could go ahead and see whether or not whatever that entity

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,800
was had something that was supposed to happen when we collide with it,

269
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,500
right?

270
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,200
And I'm not sure exactly what we'd want to do for that.

271
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,400
But you know, if we were talking about something that was like a

272
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,800
doorway.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,700
A or whatever, we could easily put something in here.

274
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,000
Right?

275
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,700
That says, you know, 32d ABS tiles, e, right again, and this is kind

276
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
of what I'm doing.

277
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,500
Basically is sticking all of the things that I want Into The Entity

278
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,300
structure for now.

279
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,400
And then we'll sort of see how we want start peeling those off a

280
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,200
little bit later.

281
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Right?

282
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,100
So like this is for stairs.

283
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,500
And I guess we should put stairs in quotes because we don't really

284
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,700
know what we want to do for stairs or rather.

285
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,900
What they're actually, what they'll actually look like in the game.

286
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,300
We don't know if they're actually the stairs.

287
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,900
It's all right.

288
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,200
So, what we could do is say, all right, if we hit, if we hit identity

289
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,900
index, then is that entity index something that we need to process,

290
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,300
you know, does it, do Collision response or does it do some other

291
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
magical effect?

292
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,900
Right?

293
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,600
And so what we could do is say another thing we could say here, right?

294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
For example, is

295
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,700
Collides right or collides with, you know, I don't know.

296
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,000
We'll just call it collides for now.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,500
Right?

298
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,700
And so what we could say is well if the test entity, if it collides,

299
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,300
right?

300
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Then we're going to do some testing, but if it doesn't Collide, then

301
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,200
we won't, right?

302
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
And so once we do the hit, enter the index, we know that it is

303
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,600
something that does Collide.

304
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,200
And then we can go ahead and here and say, well, this is where we

305
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,900
would process our Collision response and and we can sort of save a

306
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,100
little bit work here because we know that if we didn't hit any

307
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,400
entities, then we know that these things are not in play, right?

308
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,900
So we could go ahead and say that, you know, that we only do this in

309
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,500
the case where we actually hit an entity and otherwise we just

310
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,600
Break out of our Collision Loop all together, right immediately.

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,700
So we could do that.

312
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
I don't know if we want to do that, but we could do it.

313
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,200
So we might as well.

314
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,800
All right.

315
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,700
And so if we hit an entity index, then it might be nice to go ahead.

316
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,100
And after we update the player position, see what it actually is that

317
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,200
we want to do when we hit this particular entity, right?

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,300
So when we hit this particular entity, right, we're going to go ahead

319
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,000
and get it.

320
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,500
So I've got a hit empty here.

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
And then I'm going to say, well.

322
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,400
Alright now we don't need to know, you know, we don't need to know

323
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,200
most of this other stuff so we can just go ahead and do whatever that

324
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,300
that tile stuff was up in here.

325
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
We don't really have to care about this stuff.

326
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,700
Let's get rid of that and then this stuff is updating the facing

327
00:14:59,700 --> 00:14:59,900
directly.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Sharon and this I think we want to change this to be using the

329
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,400
acceleration vector, but we'll just make a note.

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,200
We'll worry about that when we get to animation.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,700
All right, so if I'm doing this and I go ahead and get that hit

332
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,500
entity, right?

333
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
And then I should be able to say, all right.

334
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,500
Well the entity P ABS tile Z.

335
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,600
So that's going to be in this dormant state, right?

336
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,500
His absolute tile Z is going to have to change now.

337
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,800
And if I change the entities, the position of the guy the camera will

338
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,400
have to change as well, but that's actually fine.

339
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,600
So I think we would move his, I think we would move his abs tiles e

340
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,300
up.

341
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,700
And the only question I have here is, how do we want to deal with that

342
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,100
with the high entity versus the dormant entity.

343
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,700
So I think the problem here if I may is really that these

344
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,300
It's, I want to really be kind of three-dimensional if that makes

345
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:02,800
sense.

346
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,500
So, I really want these guys to be 3D since they aren't right now.

347
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
I'll go ahead and say that the ABS tile Z is actually in here so that

348
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
I can update the high one.

349
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,300
But eventually what we're going to do is we're going to extend these

350
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,400
2.

351
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,500
V 3 is which may happen that may have to happen relatively soon.

352
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,800
I definitely want to happen before we get to animation but

353
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,800
That's something we'll have to deal with in a moment.

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and say, all right.

355
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,400
The high into the ABS tells e is going to get plus equal to whatever.

356
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,100
This D.

357
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:41,900
AB style Z is here and that's the entity dormant dlz, obviously.

358
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
Oops, wrong way there.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
And that's how we Implement stairs.

360
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,300
Now again, you can sort of start to see.

361
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,100
I mean, you can, you can vaguely sort of start to see what we're going

362
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,500
to be doing.

363
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,200
Eventually here.

364
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,100
You can sort of a sort of get to feel for it.

365
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,800
After we start piling enough stuff up in here, it would be, it'll be

366
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
like, all of the things you ever want to do on collision response.

367
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,500
Would all be in here.

368
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,000
Right?

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So you can already see that.

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is a place that we're going to want to start to focus, our

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,500
attention in terms of starting to support multiple types, of entities

372
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
and that sort of thing.

373
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,800
So that we don't have every single possible thing that could possibly

374
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,900
be in an entity getting stored and getting processed and all that

375
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,200
stuff.

376
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,700
Right?

377
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,300
So you can sort of see how things will our will sort of start to

378
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,200
indicate to us how we need to start to break down the

379
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,800
But at this point, obviously, it's totally fine.

380
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,000
But you can just you can kind of see it already starting.

381
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,600
This is where we'll have a bunch of data and will want to start a

382
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,100
start to Marshall that data sort of keep it under control and in

383
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,600
different ways.

384
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,900
And so that'll be very interesting when we get to that as well, but

385
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,700
we're not there yet.

386
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
So, anyway, that's right.

387
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,600
I forgot.

388
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
We have to pass.

389
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
At least at the moment.

390
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,300
We're passing, what kind of entity resolution we want four things.

391
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,100
So for now, we're doing it this way, but we're going to have to do

392
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,500
some other

393
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,500
other will do some other interesting things.

394
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,400
We might even get to that today.

395
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:58,800
We'll see.

396
00:17:59,700 --> 00:17:59,800
So,

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
See here, we have our entity and that's obviously supposed to be that

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
in the high P.

399
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,400
All of these are empty High data.

400
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,100
There we go.

401
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,300
Entity.

402
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,000
Hi, right and so on and that all looks good.

403
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Oops, that doesn't look good.

404
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,400
And this also has to have that same guy you obviously want to get the

405
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
entity at high resolution.

406
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Although actually, we only really need them at dormant now that I

407
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,800
think about it because we're not actually

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Doing.

409
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh, no, we were doing.

410
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
We were doing the EM.

411
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,500
Now.

412
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
We're just doing the yeah, we were just doing the, we're just doing

413
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
it, the doorman access so we can just get them at dormant little.

414
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,400
All right.

415
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,200
So let's see what else happens here.

416
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
These are just ones that have to be changed to emptied.

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Hi again, right?

418
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,800
Oops, entity with going to see got high.

419
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
So that's just changing like that.

420
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,600
Okay, and there we go.

421
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
Oh, well, that compiled the whole thing.

422
00:18:59,700 --> 00:18:59,900
I

423
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,600
Expecting more of a fuss than that, I guess not.

424
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

425
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
So we have a ton of work to do still because we haven't really done

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,500
all the stuff that we need to do sort.

427
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,900
For example, Change in city, residents has not been implemented yet.

428
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,500
Right?

429
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,500
And so you can see, we were trying to initialize the player and bring

430
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,000
him in there.

431
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We haven't done that.

432
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,200
We haven't actually put any of the walls into the entity list.

433
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,700
So yes, the stuffs a little bit in a cakes right now, and not in a

434
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
particularly good setup, whatsoever.

435
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,800
So, what we need to do first is say, alright, when we

436
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,600
Do change, entity residents?

437
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,900
We have to take a look and see what is going on with the entity.

438
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,500
Right now, we actually only have one thing that we really need to

439
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:42,800
handle.

440
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Or I should say, 2, to State transitions.

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,800
We need to handle, which is basically if, if the residents equals

442
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
high, right?

443
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Then we need to guarantee.

444
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
We need to move him from dormant too high.

445
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
If you was currently dormant or rather just not in high else.

446
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,500
If the residents equals entity residents low, that means removing them

447
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,300
out, right?

448
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
That's really all we

449
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,200
You to do.

450
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,500
So, what we can do here is say, alright, if the entity residence

451
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,100
equals entity.

452
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,500
Hi are sorry.

453
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
It's not equal to M TT.

454
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,400
Hi, then we know that we have to do the move.

455
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,100
Otherwise, we don't have to do anything because it's already resident

456
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,400
in the place that we wanted to be and if the residents here is not

457
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,600
equal to low, then the same is true, but or I shouldn't say low.

458
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,900
It's actually dormant that we care about here and then I guess we'll

459
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,300
say well, I guess that's really it's really if it's equal.

460
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,700
Well, to anything else at the moment we'd have to think about what

461
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,700
would happen with the when we start to have something actually in low,

462
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,000
but at the moment, everything is actually in the dormant and I wonder

463
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,300
if maybe low entities, maybe just wouldn't have hardly anything else

464
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,200
in them.

465
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
So it may look, it may look more.

466
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,600
Like if the residents.

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Either it's high and it wasn't high.

468
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,400
So as to move to high or it is anything and was going to be to be high

469
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,700
previously, right?

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,100
So it was, you know, it was anything if the residents was was was

471
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,900
already equal to.

472
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Hi.

473
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,700
I guess we could say so if it's high and it wasn't High, then we need

474
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,000
to make it High by translating it up into the camera space.

475
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,100
So

476
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,400
Map The Entity into camera space.

477
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,100
And if it was something other than high and we want and it was if it

478
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,400
was high and we want to be something other than high, then we need to

479
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,500
map it, the entity back into tile space like so, right.

480
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,400
So yeah, so that's really all we need to do.

481
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,000
They're pretty straightforward.

482
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,100
Okay.

483
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,700
And I can already think about some I'm already thinking of some things

484
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,500
that I want to do that.

485
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,600
We released that we're going to have think about that.

486
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,100
I don't quite have captured here.

487
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,900
Like the example, the thing that I'm thinking about it, my head is

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,600
what if you want, you almost want it so that you can ask for either

489
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,600
one of these and it's almost more like a caching system if that makes

490
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:22,900
sense.

491
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,800
Like, I'm thinking about it.

492
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,600
I'm going, like, I don't really want to have to worry about what state

493
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,700
it's in so much as I want to just

494
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Able to ask for one of these types of data.

495
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,300
So if I was Computing in tilemap space, I could ask for the doorman

496
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,600
entity and guarantee that that would be a valid position for him.

497
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Even if he was currently High because it would do the reverse mapping

498
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,500
at the time that I asked if it was stale, you know what I mean?

499
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,900
So, it's

500
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,800
It's a little confusing.

501
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:58,500
So I got to think that through or I might just do it so that I always

502
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,900
map them back immediately.

503
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,500
After like another thing we could do right is that when we do the move

504
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,900
player at the end, we always just do the reverse mapping just at the

505
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
end of that move player.

506
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,700
So we could always just update it up here.

507
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,600
So every time we move somebody we update them just at the end so that

508
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,800
way it's all in float, but you always write back a valid tile position

509
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,000
at the end, you know, that could be kind of interesting too.

510
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,200
Always right back a ballad tile position, right?

511
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,600
Because then everyone who wants to act to execute slowly on dormant or

512
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,000
low?

513
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,700
And it he's can and anyone who wants to go on high as could as well.

514
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,500
It's kind of compelling.

515
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,000
Kind of compelling.

516
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,200
You know what I'm saying to you.

517
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,500
So it basically just be we would have no more concept of re

518
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,700
canonicalize either.

519
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,000
We just have a thing that flat-out maps by doing it directly.

520
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

521
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,800
I think that that sounds really good to me.

522
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:00,800
Right?

523
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,200
Because you can see how that works.

524
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,000
Basically, everything happens on high entities and they just get

525
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
pushed down to the doorman entities.

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,900
Right?

527
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,100
And then you know that the dormant entities are also always valid.

528
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,800
So you have to worry about the fact that something is wouldn't have a

529
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
p that was valid.

530
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
So I think that's yeah.

531
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:15,700
Yeah.

532
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,500
I like that.

533
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,500
I like that.

534
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,300
I like that a lot.

535
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,100
And so, basically what that means to me as well, is like the change

536
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,900
entity residents, right is only

537
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,100
We going to is only going to really do this case, right?

538
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,200
It never has to map it out.

539
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,500
At all, that'll this will mostly this change.

540
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,900
Entity residents will become mostly about just managing the actual

541
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,800
lists of entities, and it won't really be very much about doing those

542
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,400
mappings.

543
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,800
All the only time it will do a mapping for us is when it needs to

544
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,900
generate the high entity out of the dormant one, right?

545
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,300
So that's kind of cool.

546
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,500
I like where this is going.

547
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,700
I'm already liking this and again, I just want to kind of point this

548
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,000
out.

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,100
I've said it a million times.

550
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,000
I'm just gonna say it again.

551
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,400
That's a reason why I code this way.

552
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,000
Is because I never would have thought of all of these things

553
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
correctly, right?

554
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,400
I just never would have, I need to go through them and see how they

555
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,800
work, and then come up with them.

556
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,000
And so, I try very hard to structure my programming technique around,

557
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,200
being able to iterate on a number of little design ideas like this.

558
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,100
And then when I know that I've got one, that's good.

559
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,800
Then I blow that out into the full design, right?

560
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
And that just saves a tremendous amount of time over trying to

561
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,400
pre-design everything up front, where I will always be wrong.

562
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,100
And I kind of feel like everyone I've ever seen do.

563
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,000
It is also wrong.

564
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,300
I don't think it's like, just me and so, just trying it first and

565
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,700
doing it.

566
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
That way is much better, because remember, it doesn't take that long.

567
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,100
We only spent a few hours doing this sort of stuff.

568
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,800
If you count up the timer amount of time, we spend doing it on the

569
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,600
sprit stream.

570
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,200
Any given thing that we're prototyping is usually only 23 hours at

571
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Max, right?

572
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,700
And and so, if you think about how little time, that is to invest

573
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
towards exploring and figuring out what truck

574
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Should be, it's so easy.

575
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,700
I mean, you know, people spend that long just draw and diagrams,

576
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,100
right.

577
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,800
That are that are not useful and so,

578
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Playing around with code, is just a really good idea.

579
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
I think for figuring out how something should be designed.

580
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,000
So I guess what I want to do here is I want to calculate P.

581
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,800
So what I want to do is I want to say that the entity dormant P equals

582
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:35,400
map, you know, map into tile space or something like this, right?

583
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,700
And then, what I do is, I would pass the camera that we're using

584
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,600
currently and so that's, that's

585
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
This guy right here, right?

586
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
So this is, this is the base point.

587
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,000
So, yeah, so game Space camera P.

588
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,100
So that's the base point.

589
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,800
And then my entity.

590
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,800
Hi,

591
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,900
P is my current point.

592
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,100
And I'll just trust that will always generate, you know, a valid sort

593
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,000
of position there.

594
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Right?

595
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,300
And that way, I know that those will always be valid as well, and that

596
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,300
will be pretty free to do.

597
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,700
It's like, you know, to divides or something like that per entity and

598
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,900
we're already doing so much work.

599
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,100
Obviously to update entities that I don't think that'll be

600
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,700
particularly relevant.

601
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,600
Okay.

602
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,000
So if we go ahead and do that, may I really want to I really like

603
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,900
typing doormat.

604
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,500
By the way?

605
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,100
So now we've gotten rid of re canonicalized, right?

606
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,300
It's gone and are we canonicalize function is just going to be that.

607
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,400
That

608
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,700
Mapping function, right?

609
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,100
So in fact, we can even just kind of lean on the one we have already.

610
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,000
So map into tile space write.

611
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,700
This function is now just going to be this, right.

612
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,100
So we pass, we're going to have to pass that tile map.

613
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,000
Oops, town that that's just gonna be map into tile space, right Hoops.

614
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Not that one.

615
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,400
Map into tile space, and all we really have to do is say, okay.

616
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,700
We've got that base position and then we've got an offset, right?

617
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,100
And that's really easy because we already essentially wrote this

618
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,600
function.

619
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,300
All we really have to do is just we don't even have to do the work.

620
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,900
Right.

621
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,900
All we really have to do is just that I think, right.

622
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,400
So basically we take that base position, we treat it as if we had

623
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
updated it and then we go in here.

624
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,900
And by the way, I think these were busted, right?

625
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,700
Remember, we didn't really need those.

626
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,000
Um, if I remember correctly, that was just a garbage thing that we've

627
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,300
done because we had forgot to call reconnect lives or something like

628
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,600
this.

629
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,300
I don't know.

630
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,900
They were sent there was something that's going on there.

631
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,200
So we're gonna get rid of that for now as well.

632
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,800
Alright, so let's go ahead and see if we've got this correctly.

633
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Not a member of tilemap writes, the offset their and reconnect lies

634
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,100
position.

635
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,200
We don't care about this anymore.

636
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,700
See, and that is it.

637
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Aunt isn't, it's right.

638
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
It's not world, we go.

639
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,200
So let's do that.

640
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,300
And let's that's Point as well.

641
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
Alright, so that is that.

642
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,600
Now, what should happen I guess at the moment is we should okay.

643
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,100
We still have one more thing to implement and that is the change

644
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,100
entity residents function that has to go ahead and actually map

645
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:33,600
things.

646
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,000
Into entity space into the camera space.

647
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,800
So wherever that camera p is right, what we need to do is say we need

648
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
to do that difference.

649
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,300
That tile difference that we were doing before, right?

650
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:47,800
Here we go.

651
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,300
Let's see.

652
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,800
Tom app difference, we need to do this guy.

653
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,500
So we got to take that difference.

654
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,700
Where is that function?

655
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,000
It is subtract.

656
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,900
And so we are going

657
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,900
Subtract the entity position.

658
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,400
And that's the dormant position from wherever the camera is at the

659
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,200
moment.

660
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,800
And that is going to be where the entity now resides.

661
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,900
All right, so I would that needs the tile map.

662
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,300
So let's see.

663
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,600
We just did a ton of stuff.

664
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,800
I feel the need at the moment to kind of Step through here and kind of

665
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,200
get our bearings a little bit.

666
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,600
These are addresses.

667
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:38,100
So that diff now needs to have our entity High has to get initialized.

668
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,500
So what have we got here?

669
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,600
Well, oops.

670
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,400
Well, our enemy, hi now has two.

671
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:51,800
Have a key which is just going to be that div a right.

672
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,400
So that's the X Y, our entity High.

673
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,300
D p is going to be nothing will just assume.

674
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,400
He has no velocity at start which may be something.

675
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
We want to change in the future, but we're not sure it's ABS tile.

676
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:09,300
Z is just going to be whatever it's Z actually was, right.

677
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,900
So that's going to be AB style Z there and it's facing Direction.

678
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,500
Is just going to be 0.

679
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:18,900
I guess.

680
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,200
We'll assume that gets updated some point.

681
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,100
What was the actual name for that?

682
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,300
D?

683
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
X,y.

684
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,700
So, all right.

685
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,200
So let's see what's going on now because we've made so many changes at

686
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,100
this point groups.

687
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,400
Then MS.

688
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,500
Death was the old name.

689
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
They change it to Dev.

690
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,100
MF.

691
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't ask me why, nobody knows.

692
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,100
So let's take a look at what's going on here because who has any idea

693
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,800
at this point?

694
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:46,900
What?

695
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,500
Going on.

696
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,700
So what we would want to start with is we want to start with the point

697
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,400
where a player actually becomes active.

698
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:54,700
Right?

699
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,200
So I hit the spacebar and we're going to add an entity we go through

700
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,800
here.

701
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,600
It's going to be entity one, which is correct.

702
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,200
That's what we want.

703
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,500
I would like to turn hexadecimal off, please.

704
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,100
Yeah.

705
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,400
And that's going to go ahead and clear all of the stuff out which is

706
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,900
fine and we're going to send it to dormant and that's about it.

707
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,900
Then we're going to initialize the player.

708
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,400
So we're going to go ahead and get that entity and let's see here.

709
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,600
We got all of the versions of it, even though it's technically still

710
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,300
dormant.

711
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,000
That's okay.

712
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,900
Because we're not actually doing any kind of compression with that

713
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,300
yet.

714
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,700
We're going to set where we think that it is and you know, we haven't

715
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,500
actually set.

716
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,000
Do we actually, I guess we did set the

717
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,000
Camera position as well.

718
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
So then we're going to call change entity residents.

719
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,500
So we come up here.

720
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,600
We say if the residents equals High, which it does in this case, but

721
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600
it wasn't equal to high before, then we need to do our initialization

722
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,400
at the high entity.

723
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
So let's take a look.

724
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,400
Where is that?

725
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
It's - 9 - 1.

726
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,200
Those are relatively reasonable values.

727
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,800
I would think and we're going to

728
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,700
That ABS tile to where it was facing Direction.

729
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,100
So we've done that.

730
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,000
And since there was nothing else.

731
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,800
We're going to set the camera to follow and we're going to have to go.

732
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,300
We have to go update that camera fellow codes, don't think we ever

733
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,200
actually did that.

734
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,100
Alright, so that's all we did there and then we should be able to kind

735
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,600
of will step through it a little bit more and see.

736
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,600
All right.

737
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,900
So we're doing this railroad rail column nonsense now, so this stuff

738
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,900
is going to go away as well.

739
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,800
I think in a second here.

740
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
We'll find out.

741
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,300
So let me skip it.

742
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,600
Skip through here, anything that's entity residents High which is the

743
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
first one in the second one.

744
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,400
Neither of them were.

745
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,500
Oh, did we forget?

746
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,100
You know what?

747
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,500
I think we forgot to actually ever set the residence change and see

748
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,200
residents.

749
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,300
So we need to do at the end of this is say entity residents equals

750
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,000
residents.

751
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,800
So otherwise it'll never get marked as high which is not what we want.

752
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,600
Okay, so let's try that one more time.

753
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,100
See what happens.

754
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,800
So, we want to go down here to there, and let's see what happens here.

755
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,300
So, if we do this and I hit the spacebar.

756
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,300
I am still not even triggering your breakpoints.

757
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,300
So why is that the case did we, or did we not add an entity?

758
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,800
I guess we did not have an entities somehow.

759
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
So let's find out.

760
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,699
Let's open right?

761
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,600
Oh, that was funny.

762
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,199
That was funny.

763
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,000
If that doesn't change the end of the residence, that's just a note of

764
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,100
what the residence is.

765
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,100
We actually need to do it here, right?

766
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,699
That's actually where we need to change the actual entity.

767
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,300
Residence.

768
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,199
So I'm guessing that really what we want to do for that is that that

769
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,000
should probably be.

770
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,700
We would put that in the dormant part after I suspect, because there's

771
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,900
really no need for having an extra one here since we always have to

772
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
have the

773
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:13,000
The Entity data, but yeah, I don't know.

774
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,400
I don't know.

775
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,300
Yeah, well, there's a couple things we need to do.

776
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
So, let's do them both.

777
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,600
So, first of all, let's change this so that when we do the change,

778
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,700
entity residents will actually just do this.

779
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
In fact, you know, what, we don't even really need change.

780
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Entity residents to do that.

781
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,200
Really, right.

782
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,000
This is actually going to be here, and this could actually be

783
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,700
something that's just taking the you into

784
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,100
32 of the end of the index.

785
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,400
So this is going to go ahead and say that entity residents like so is

786
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,200
Empty index equals the residents, right?

787
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,800
And then this entity.

788
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,200
Hi, it's only going to probably ever have to.

789
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,900
Well, now I guess it needs to do the rest of it too.

790
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,000
But that's just going to go ahead and do these two.

791
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,700
So in the case where these are here, we have the high entity equals

792
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,400
game State, high entities, and 50 index.

793
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,100
Go and the doorman entity.

794
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,800
T is game, state government entities, and 50 index.

795
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,700
All right, so we've got those, that's all.

796
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,700
Happy change this that that?

797
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,300
Okay, so that'll do that.

798
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,000
And I'm just going to have get entity.

799
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,600
Say, if the residents that you requested is less than

800
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,800
The residents are sorry is a greater than the residents that the

801
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,900
entity currently is, right, then it'll do that change.

802
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,100
So the first thing it will do is say, okay.

803
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,300
Here.

804
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
Yeah, because this is, this is garbage.

805
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,400
In fact, what this is doing.

806
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,900
This is not actually what it should be doing.

807
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,400
Right?

808
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,300
Because this was just filling in, whatever the residents was, we

809
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,500
really want to do is say if what we were currently residing at, right?

810
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,400
If the current residents like so if the current place that we are

811
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,600
residing is not where we want to reside, right?

812
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,900
So if it's less than, then we need to do that change entity residents

813
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,000
right to make sure that it's not anymore.

814
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,900
And

815
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,700
We can know that it is, so we could assert here that it was right,

816
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
that these are equal after the fact.

817
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,400
And or I shouldn't say equal The Entity residents is at least greater

818
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,800
than, or equal to, because really, we could allow that function that

819
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000
change residents to change.

820
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,700
You at its discretion to a higher level of residence.

821
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,300
We just don't want you to change you to a lower level of residents.

822
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,500
So that's what that does, right?

823
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Okay.

824
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,800
So, all we really need to do now.

825
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,700
Is figure out where is that residents again?

826
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,300
That residence is here.

827
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,800
So what we need to say is if the entity residents as it exists is not

828
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,500
equal to high.

829
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Then there we go.

830
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
And let's see, change it to your residence.

831
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,800
This takes an empty index now and this is stuff.

832
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
I don't like about that too.

833
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,500
Many indexes versus struck thing.

834
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,800
So we have to look at that a little bit more, but does it really

835
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,700
matter at the moment?

836
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,700
Okay, so that should be now, I think changing it.

837
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,000
That we actually have an entity.

838
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,400
Okay, we do and let's take a look at what the entity actually looks

839
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,200
like high entity, low, entity dormant entity, right?

840
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,500
Here.

841
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:57,800
They are.

842
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,900
So there's the offset of the

843
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Guy is facing Direction.

844
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,700
Let's see.

845
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,700
What happens here.

846
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,300
There.

847
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,000
He is.

848
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,000
He's moving around now.

849
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,700
He should be able to walk straight through walls, which is true,

850
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,700
because, of course, we're not doing, we're not adding those entities

851
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,400
yet, right now.

852
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,100
If I add another guy, I feel like maybe they would Collide now

853
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,900
potentially.

854
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
Maybe not know.

855
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,700
So I would like to double.

856
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
I'd like to go see why?

857
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,000
That isn't because of that, I think should be working.

858
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So let's let's debug that because that is the one Collision that I do.

859
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,900
Think should probably work.

860
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,300
So, let's take a look.

861
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,800
So, what should be happening is when we do our Collision iterations

862
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,900
here, right?

863
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,900
We should be testing with the oh, you know, what else?

864
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,300
We kind of need to do is well, we need to make sure we don't collide

865
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,000
with our self.

866
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,100
Let me do that first as well.

867
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Why do I keep closing the app?

868
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,200
I have to remember to stop closing the app.

869
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,600
I never need to close the app.

870
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,600
I need to fix the thing that was working out at work so that it has

871
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
the hot reloading as well.

872
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,500
So I just get used to never having to close apps anymore.

873
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,100
You should never really have to close them.

874
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,200
All right.

875
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,900
So what I want to do is say, don't use the index that we are, right?

876
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,400
So, you know, and that's pretty easy.

877
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,700
I could just test the pointer as well.

878
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
So I could just say all right.

879
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:24,700
No.

880
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,600
Basically, if test entity, .hi is not equal to Unity.

881
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,500
Hi, something like this, right?

882
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,700
That'd be pretty trivial, way to avoid testing against oneself.

883
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,500
Alright, so off we go and keep going there.

884
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,700
Let's move this guy over here.

885
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,000
Right?

886
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,700
And this is a search should be colliding, It Isn't.

887
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,800
So, I think that's just a bunch.

888
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,500
Right, so I want to see and make sure that we're actually okay.

889
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,300
So the first time through, we wouldn't try to collide with that guy

890
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,500
because it's us the next time through.

891
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,900
There we go.

892
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,100
It is not set to collide.

893
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,300
That would be it.

894
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:18,400
So when we add a player we want to say Clyde's, is true, right?

895
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,700
And now, maybe they will collide.

896
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,900
I don't know, hard to say very hard to say.

897
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,200
In fact, if we go, there we go.

898
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,100
And so we'll move this guy in here and see what happens if they

899
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,300
Collide they do.

900
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,500
In fact Collide.

901
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,600
Yes, although it doesn't quite skate properly.

902
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,600
So we still have some bugs in there.

903
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,200
Again.

904
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,900
The Collision Vector is pretty bad at this point.

905
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,400
So it's really not that big of a deal, but that should not be

906
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:49,600
happening.

907
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,300
Don't believe so.

908
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,800
We should go.

909
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,400
Double-check, what's going on in there?

910
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,800
I think that might just be again with the, I don't know if that's more

911
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
with the Epsilon issues.

912
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
On because like we haven't really done a good job.

913
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,200
Making our Coalition detector, do anything that you would want it to

914
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,400
normally do to keep things robust or good.

915
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,000
We only did like the very bare minimum.

916
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,600
So, you know, if this was something a little more conservative here, I

917
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:20,300
wonder if that would also keep us out of the woods until we actually

918
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,300
go ahead and make a real Collision sector but let's see.

919
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,100
Yeah.

920
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,600
So the sticking is definitely not is definitely not right.

921
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
At least you don't get Epsilon trapped anymore.

922
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,100
Yeah.

923
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,700
So what's going on with our sticking?

924
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,900
What is the problem?

925
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,400
Did I inadvertently muck up the code when I came in here.

926
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,800
So assuming that I hit an entity, if I didn't hit an entity.

927
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,600
Oh.

928
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,700
Do I ever actually set that?

929
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,200
Of course, not?

930
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Duh, all right.

931
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,300
So that's our only problem entity index has to be equal to whatever

932
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,300
the enemy index was right that we, that we actually hit.

933
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,400
So, there we go.

934
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,000
That's really all we needed.

935
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,800
We weren't actually ever processing that case.

936
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,000
So yeah, of course, this is actually stuck in the guy now, that's

937
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,500
pretty funny.

938
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,600
Well, that's actually not that big of a deal to fix, right?

939
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,400
I can just do

940
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,100
I can just do this.

941
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,800
Right.

942
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Initial stress is constant.

943
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,300
I know, well, if entity index equals zero, there we go.

944
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,100
Now I can get out, right?

945
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,500
And then I may have to fix the Collision detector.

946
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,200
It's bugging me enough that it's not robust enough yet that it's

947
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,500
already bugging me a little but okay, at least now gliding is working

948
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,100
properly.

949
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,800
So we can at least get that roughly.

950
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,300
Okay.

951
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,200
I hate leaving things broken, but sometimes I know that it's better to

952
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,000
leave them broken.

953
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,100
When you're not trying to actually ship them, your, you may just be

954
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,100
wasting time and so it's good to not do that sometimes and I can

955
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,900
appreciate that.

956
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:14,900
Anyway.

957
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,100
That's good.

958
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,300
That guys colliding properly, so that's nice.

959
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,700
And so now let's think about what else we need to do.

960
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,600
So we've done our mapping and everything is now happening in float

961
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,500
space, which is good.

962
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,800
That's all very nice.

963
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,300
But we also.

964
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,900
Now, let's start to look at what we have to do for the world itself

965
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
and also for moving the camera.

966
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,700
So like, let's try to put doors in there.

967
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,400
Let's try it with fire, but stairs and the walls, and that sort of

968
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,800
stuff, right?

969
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,600
Because you haven't done that yet.

970
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,300
So, assuming that, whatever the camera following entity is has,

971
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,200
That's the that's one we should.

972
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,700
We should look at right to be sure.

973
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,600
So.

974
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,400
What we want to do here.

975
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,800
Is make this work in Thailand camera space like our to do said, so we

976
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
want to do is say all right.

977
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Well, we already know the stuff.

978
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,400
We were Computing with that diffe before we already know where the guy

979
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,700
is relative, the camera because his high position is now exactly that,

980
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,400
right.

981
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,300
So all we really need to say is okay, if the camera following entity

982
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
High position

983
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,800
Right?

984
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:31,600
If the camera following entity High position is if that is greater

985
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,000
than however far, we allow him to walk, then we know we need to move.

986
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,200
The same is true.

987
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:37,800
Right?

988
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,200
For the other directions.

989
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,200
These are all exactly the same checks as they were, right.

990
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,500
No big deal, py and so on.

991
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:52,700
So when we do these checks, we now will move the ABS tile.

992
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,300
X, the app style.

993
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,700
Why?

994
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,100
We'll move all those in the right direction.

995
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,600
So what we need to do is we just need to take whatever that difference

996
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:00,800
is.

997
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,600
However, far the camera moved.

998
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,900
So, this is the original camera P, right?

999
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,100
Or the old camera pee.

1000
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,600
We'll do whatever updating we need to do to follow the guy and then

1001
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,100
we'll take a look and see whatever his whatever that cameras position

1002
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:19,300
is.

1003
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:19,700
Now.

1004
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,600
We need to update all the end of these by that.

1005
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,200
Right?

1006
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,300
So we basically need to say, okay.

1007
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,600
Let's take a look at what that tilemap diff was, again.

1008
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,100
See, what is that called?

1009
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,300
Tile, Tom app difference.

1010
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,400
So we need to do tile map difference and we will go ahead and say from

1011
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,700
the current right to the camera P will subtract away.

1012
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,300
Whatever.

1013
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,900
The old camera P was.

1014
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,300
Right?

1015
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,100
And that gives us how far we have to move everything.

1016
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,400
That's right.

1017
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,600
That's how far the old the camera moved from, its current location to

1018
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,000
its new location, right?

1019
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,500
So

1020
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,500
If that's the direction that the camera moved.

1021
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,500
Then what we want to do is we want to move everyone else by the

1022
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,500
opposite of that, right?

1023
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,400
In other words.

1024
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
This is this is the D camera p.

1025
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:22,000
And what we want to do is have like the object offset, right?

1026
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,500
So the offset they're going to apply to all of the entities.

1027
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,100
So the entity offset is going to be the opposite of that, right?

1028
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,800
To give you some perspective.

1029
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,000
What I'm talking about here.

1030
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,500
We have the screen.

1031
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,100
We know that the camera was here and then we did something and we're

1032
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,900
going to say, okay the camera goes here.

1033
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
So entities that were here, right?

1034
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,200
When the camera moves, if we were to apply the same translation, they

1035
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,400
would move with us, but that's not what we want.

1036
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,700
We're moving away from them.

1037
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,500
So they should be the opposite direction.

1038
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:51,800
Right?

1039
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,900
So we want to basically move them the other direction so that when we

1040
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,400
render them, they'll appear to have slid, if that makes sense.

1041
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
So we want to move them count.

1042
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,100
To the motion of the camera.

1043
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,900
So this is basically D camera P DX y, right.

1044
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
That's what we're going to do there.

1045
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,400
And then we just Loop over all the entities and we Loop over the all

1046
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,700
the entities and apply that.

1047
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,200
And what we could do if we wanted to actually is we can roll that in.

1048
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,500
We can just straight-up role that in to our to our update Loop.

1049
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Actually, you know, we could just do this.

1050
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:32,000
We could eat, we could just do this Sophie to entity Offset, you know,

1051
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,300
for frame equals nothing.

1052
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,500
And then we compute it in that case, right?

1053
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,200
And then, when we're in here, when we grab that high entity.

1054
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,800
The first thing we do is just say, okay.

1055
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,600
Hi, entity P, plus equals entity all set for frame.

1056
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,700
Make sense seems pretty reasonable.

1057
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,700
He's got to be addresses, of course, and that has to be an arrow.

1058
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,800
So I think that's all that has to happen for updating.

1059
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Those guys will drop it in a tea down there.

1060
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,600
And then we'll drop another one in here.

1061
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,300
Help me out.

1062
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,200
They get they spawn in each other.

1063
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,400
Then they can't leave because the wall prevents the Collision.

1064
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,200
So lame, I gotta I gotta fix that.

1065
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,700
I mean, not that you should ever spawn inside someone but obviously

1066
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,000
just just the way the conductor works just a little wonky there.

1067
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,300
So yeah, so now that's that's correct, I believe.

1068
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,500
And so we need to do now is

1069
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,900
Oh, we wrapped which we don't allow by the way.

1070
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
What's that Tyrell?

1071
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,500
Times greater than.

1072
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,300
Yeah, so we don't, since we don't support rapping.

1073
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,100
We can't walk off the bottom side of the screen yet, right?

1074
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,600
Or the left side.

1075
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,500
That's a, that's a massive faux pas.

1076
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,700
I suppose, we'll have to go ahead and move ourselves to the center.

1077
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,500
That'll be a good thing that we can do as well for getting us into the

1078
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,100
position that we that we want to be in for storing stuff sparsely.

1079
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,900
So yeah, that's all good.

1080
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,200
So now we really just kind of need to I guess.

1081
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,400
One thing we could do is we'll start.

1082
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,000
We'll start by making doors.

1083
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,300
These guys work again.

1084
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:26,300
The stairwells also should we be able to find some other part of the

1085
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,700
world here that had stuff in it?

1086
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,500
When we came back downstairs.

1087
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,600
There should have been a place where we came back downstairs, right?

1088
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,500
Yeah.

1089
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,100
Here it is.

1090
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,700
Of course, I don't know where it comes back again.

1091
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,700
I'm lost.

1092
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,900
It really would help if we had more backgrounds.

1093
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:47,900
There we go.

1094
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,600
Yeah, so yeah, I guess what I'll do is since we're at the five-minute

1095
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,800
warning, I won't try and do that today, but that's basically, I guess

1096
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
what we'll do tomorrow is Will.

1097
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,300
Art by starting to deal with.

1098
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,100
Putting the walls in the door, putting the walls in the stairs.

1099
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,300
I should say in there, that seems like the most logical next thing to

1100
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:11,700
do.

1101
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,900
And then at that point, we should have ourselves in position to kind

1102
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,800
of take a step back and look at what's going on with the entities and,

1103
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:26,000
and with everything else so that we can maybe turn the crank one more

1104
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,700
time on that and do a little more stuff.

1105
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,200
Like, you know, like I said, maybe, let's put some monsters in here.

1106
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,800
Let's put some hip points in here.

1107
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,400
Let's put

1108
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,600
You know, some gaming stuff in there.

1109
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,300
So we can start to see how that entity structure shapes up and maybe

1110
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,600
play around a little bit with how we want to structure that.

1111
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,400
But yeah, so and we'll, we'll try spamming out.

1112
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,400
A lot of entities and having the dormant array and then on door opener

1113
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,700
a look, we'll just let us try all that stuff a little bit just to kind

1114
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,700
of get us to the point where were relatively certain that we've got

1115
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,200
things should you know shook out as much as they need to be.

1116
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,400
I suspect I want to do a couple more things to that high dormant low

1117
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,100
structure.

1118
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,300
Once I have some people simulating out, like, in the world that's not

1119
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,000
on camera and so on.

1120
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:23,500
Yeah, so what we need to do now, let me just put in some to dues for

1121
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,100
tomorrow, so we know what we're doing.

1122
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,500
So basically what we need is, we're going to need some functions here,

1123
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,400
right?

1124
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:38,100
We're going to need like, when the camera moves so in the, in the

1125
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:45,400
case, for the camera moves like there to do Casey map.

1126
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,600
New entities in and old entities out.

1127
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,600
Whoa, I forgot.

1128
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,000
I got that.

1129
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,700
Zoom feature.

1130
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,500
And these out.

1131
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:06,500
And we also want to do some stuff with mapping tiles and stairs into

1132
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:10,000
the empty set and then we'll be good.

1133
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,600
So I think that's yet.

1134
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,000
I think that's about right and that is what we will do tomorrow.

1135
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,800
Okay, we're a little early, but that's okay.

1136
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,500
I don't want to start something else now because it's going to be a

1137
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,700
relatively major something.

1138
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,700
So, let's go ahead and go to the Q&A.

1139
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,700
Please prefix, your questions.

1140
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,300
Q:.

1141
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,900
So, I will see them and please keep them to be stuff that we did on

1142
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,200
today streamer that we did in a previous stream so that we don't get

1143
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:33,600
off topic.

1144
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,200
If you want to do off-topic questions, come about 15 minutes before

1145
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,800
the stream starts, and we will, we will talk about them then.

1146
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,000
Let's see.

1147
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,800
Do we have any questions?

1148
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,400
That's the real question.

1149
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,900
The real question is, do we have any questions?

1150
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,700
Why can't infrequent entity updates happen in the entities update

1151
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,400
logic?

1152
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:28,500
So that's kind of a slightly odd question because what we're talking

1153
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,000
about here is really when the entities update logic gets called, if

1154
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,800
that makes sense.

1155
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:39,300
So, the reason that I don't want to have to, so, you know, if you're

1156
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,100
thinking about it like

1157
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,500
If you're thinking about it, like something like this, you know, the

1158
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,500
sort of the, the old-school object-oriented way where you've got

1159
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:55,800
something like this, you know, happening, any logic that you put in

1160
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,100
here is inherently pretty problematic.

1161
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:58,600
Right?

1162
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,900
And the reason it's problematic is because frequency update logic that

1163
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,300
goes in here, you have to call them all.

1164
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,300
So if I wanted to scale the number of entities to a very large number,

1165
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,900
like, let's say I wanted to scale to 100,000 in it.

1166
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,500
Or something like that, right?

1167
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Well, now I have to make 100,000 virtual function calls just to find

1168
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,200
out whether or not the entity should get updated.

1169
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,900
Right?

1170
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,900
And that's just very inefficient.

1171
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,600
And, you know, you can pick the number, whatever the number is that

1172
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,600
you want depending on how fast the machine is.

1173
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,800
Obviously your you're just, you're not going to scale properly.

1174
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,200
So what you want to do is you want to make it so that you have some

1175
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,600
kind of a concept.

1176
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,200
Outside from the entity of which entities need what, when?

1177
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,300
Right.

1178
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,000
And so by breaking it into the do, at least two tiers.

1179
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,300
I don't know if we'll have three in the end.

1180
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,200
But at least two tiers high frequency and low frequency, right?

1181
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,700
We know that we can always scale up the number of entities and not

1182
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,700
have have to worry about performance CPU performance.

1183
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,600
Now, Memory footprint.

1184
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,900
Another question, right?

1185
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,100
How much storage we have?

1186
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,100
Four entities is separate issue, right, but we want to worry about

1187
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,800
performance because we

1188
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,700
Always scale up the number of entities by updating them less

1189
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,000
frequently, right?

1190
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,800
So we are free to make that trade-off with the virtual function call

1191
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,200
method.

1192
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,300
You can't make that trade-off.

1193
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,500
You've completely given up the ability to make that trade-off, right?

1194
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,400
Because just the act of looping over them and issuing.

1195
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,900
The virtual function call is too slow at some breaking point.

1196
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,100
Where as well.

1197
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,000
We won't have that problem, right?

1198
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,500
We can scale up almost ad infinitum and you just won't pay for it, you

1199
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,100
know, as long as you set that tick frequency to be low enough.

1200
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:40,900
It'll

1201
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,100
I'll work, it'll just get less accurate, right?

1202
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,400
And that's a much better place to be.

1203
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,600
Why do you want to use a 3D Vector for?

1204
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,100
When the Z value is always going to be an integer.

1205
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,400
So I don't think it's gonna always be even sure.

1206
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,800
That's the reason why I agree that if it was always going to be

1207
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,500
integer, it would be kind of dumb but I don't think it is going to be.

1208
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,800
So here's what I think, what I think is we're going to have a problem.

1209
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,700
Well, we already have the problem, but we're going to have to solve

1210
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,000
the problem.

1211
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,900
Let me put it that way.

1212
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,300
And basically that is, we've got dudes, right, you know, we've got our

1213
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,900
hero or whatever and you know, he's walking around.

1214
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,200
And and if you think about the way that he is structured, and the way

1215
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,700
that other things, the world is structured like, you know, tree or

1216
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,300
whatever.

1217
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,200
We want to be able to do stuff like have him jump right or bounce.

1218
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,900
So he might be off the ground, right?

1219
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,200
So if this is the shadow of the guys, right?

1220
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,100
And here we go.

1221
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,400
Right, and so now he's got are right.

1222
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,300
He's jumping up and down or whatever, right?

1223
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,100
So think about all of this and think about how this works.

1224
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,200
We're going to have to render him so that everything occludes

1225
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,400
properly, right?

1226
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,000
We're going to have to render him so that if there's a tree and he's

1227
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,600
in front of the tree, right?

1228
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,700
If he's in front of the tree, then we don't want anywhere where he is.

1229
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,500
We don't want the tree to be obscuring him.

1230
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,600
We want him to be in front of the tree, right?

1231
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,600
You know, we want, I don't know if this eraser Works, let's find out.

1232
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,400
No, of course, the Eraser doesn't work.

1233
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,800
Why would the eraser work?

1234
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,000
It's only 2015.

1235
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,500
There's no reason why a drawing program would be able to have the

1236
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,700
eraser work on the pan.

1237
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,400
so anyway,

1238
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,500
so we want him to be able to occlude the tree so that you don't see

1239
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
what's behind him.

1240
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,100
Right?

1241
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,300
So if you think about it, how are we going to do that?

1242
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,000
You know, what's our, what's our cue?

1243
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,500
How does the engine even know what's in front of what and the answer,

1244
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:03,900
you know, one pretty trivial answer is.

1245
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,700
Well, the y coordinate tells us something about where things are

1246
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:09,600
right?

1247
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,500
Because things that are higher up on the screen, right?

1248
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,700
Our first are back further away from the camera in our mental model,

1249
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:16,900
right?

1250
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,700
In other words, when we when we're doing this, right?

1251
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,400
And we have this guy here and we you know, we move this guy in front

1252
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:24,800
of him.

1253
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,200
That looks right?

1254
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,400
But that looks wrong already.

1255
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,400
You know what I mean?

1256
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,400
So we know that things with a higher.

1257
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,200
Why we're going to have to start drawing them behind things with a

1258
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,000
lower y.

1259
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,000
So the lower the why is the closer the camera?

1260
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,100
It is basically right?

1261
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:40,900
Does that make sense?

1262
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,200
Hopefully, I'm not saying anything here, that's totally ridiculous.

1263
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,100
And this all makes a fairly reasonable sense to you.

1264
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:55,200
So what happens now when we start talking about jumping, well, if this

1265
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,500
guy jumped such that his wife, I was up further, you know, here or

1266
00:59:59,500 --> 00:59:59,800
whatever.

1267
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,700
Or something like that.

1268
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,300
We don't want to draw behind the tree because he's still in front of

1269
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:06,500
the tree.

1270
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,400
He's just jumping.

1271
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So the y-coordinate alone is not sufficient.

1272
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,000
Right?

1273
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,500
What we really want to know is that there's a wide base point and that

1274
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,800
base point you sorted, but then there's also a z which essentially

1275
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,200
translates the why upward and gives it a higher Y without actually

1276
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,100
changing its or

1277
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,600
So I think we're going to have x,y positions for people plus a z

1278
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,200
position for you know for Sprites and whatever and the same would go

1279
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,700
for flying entities like, you know, if there's a dude with wings and

1280
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,300
he's flying around, right?

1281
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,600
That that to me is is what I think would probably happen.

1282
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,700
And so what I want to do is switch to using x y z and then the Z

1283
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,900
values will just work like everything else.

1284
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,400
They'll be some height.

1285
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,100
Where if you go

1286
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,200
Above that height.

1287
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:07,200
You have walked on to the next tile map slice, and it'll just work.

1288
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,800
Uniformly, with the X and Y.

1289
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,200
That's my hope.

1290
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,100
We'll see what actually happens.

1291
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,800
Dustin kalsi.

1292
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,200
Kaur infection have to be axis.

1293
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:34,400
Aligned know we implemented a very simple algorithm.

1294
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,700
A very simple version of the minkowski closure sector.

1295
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,100
Like I said, it's not very good, will be doing much better stuff.

1296
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,200
As we go further in the Stream.

1297
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,400
I just want to do something to get a collision Vector in there,

1298
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,600
because I don't think we need much of a conductor right now to

1299
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:52,200
prototype stuff, but later, the one that we

1300
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,800
I assume anyways, I don't know till we actually get there, but I

1301
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,400
assume the one will do later on the stream will actually handle

1302
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:57,800
rotation.

1303
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,800
Probably just fine.

1304
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,200
I don't know if we'll actually use it for rotation, will probably use

1305
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,100
it more for shape variance, so that we can have circles and that kind

1306
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,100
of stuff, but you could have used the same technique would work for

1307
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:07,700
rotation.

1308
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,000
Just not animated rotation.

1309
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,900
Okay, no more questions.

1310
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,100
That is it for questions.

1311
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,200
Well.

1312
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,300
Very well.

1313
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,600
I guess.

1314
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,400
I guess we will end early tonight.

1315
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,400
Seems like it.

1316
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,500
I'll wait a couple seconds more just to see whether anyone has one.

1317
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Didn't you just Implement a bare-bones?

1318
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,300
Relational database?

1319
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
How do you think that's a good mental model?

1320
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,500
For understanding today's code?

1321
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,000
Well.

1322
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,100
That's a interesting question.

1323
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:32,400
So, I did, I have implemented an entire game engine before.

1324
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,700
By writing a relational database at the bottom at the that was like at

1325
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,500
the bottom of it.

1326
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,700
and what I would say is,

1327
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,000
It is.

1328
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,400
Relational databases in general.

1329
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:02,300
Isn't really much of a statement like a relational database implies,

1330
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,300
usually a bunch of additional stuff.

1331
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
If you say it to most people like their thinking sequel, they're

1332
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,700
thinking query-based stuff.

1333
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,400
And a lot of that isn't necessarily relevant to what we're doing here.

1334
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,500
But if you're literally just talking about the cost of relational

1335
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,000
database, where you have a key.

1336
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,800
And you can pull things on a key and, you know, you can gather from

1337
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,700
multiple tables.

1338
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,100
Then.

1339
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,800
Yeah, I mean that is a, that is a very good mental model for things.

1340
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,400
Unfortunately.

1341
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,400
If you think about it too much, in terms of the way that they're often

1342
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:43,000
implemented or exposed to the programmer in today's world.

1343
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,900
It becomes not such a good model.

1344
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,000
And the reason for that is because a lot of things that you want to

1345
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,400
just be able to do with pointers and graphs and

1346
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:58,500
Of are really not representable in query languages like Sequel and so,

1347
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:01,300
you know, you end up with all these ridiculous things like stored

1348
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:04,700
procedures and just all this garbage happening that you just don't

1349
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,300
want.

1350
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:06,600
And so,

1351
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,300
I guess what I would say about relational databases is that if you're

1352
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:15,900
thinking of it literally, just as may be learning some of the first

1353
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:22,300
principles of relational database storage might be useful way of

1354
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:22,900
thinking about it.

1355
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,700
But if you're thinking about it, like sequel, that's not such a good

1356
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:28,700
way, right?

1357
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,200
Because sequels, just kind of not good.

1358
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,200
But I mean, hardcore, relational, database, people don't think

1359
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,000
sequels, good either, you know, well, I shouldn't say that there are.

1360
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,800
There definitely are, hardcore, relational.

1361
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,000
Database people who think that sequel is a very good either.

1362
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,700
So, you know, that's hardly a surprise, right?

1363
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,400
I noticed your character do not collide with each other.

1364
01:05:59,400 --> 01:05:59,900
I thought you changed.

1365
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,200
No, it does Collide.

1366
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,400
It's just we're only at the moment.

1367
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,000
We kind of we're trying to decide how big the players footprint is.

1368
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,600
And right now it's just those those rectangles.

1369
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,400
So it's just a little rectangles that Collide and you can see that

1370
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,200
they do actually Collide at the moment.

1371
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:15,800
Right?

1372
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,100
Does that make sense?

1373
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,100
So those are what Collide?

1374
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Now, we will allow the player to walk through like for example, that

1375
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,200
is a totally valid configuration for entities even in the final game,

1376
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:28,800
right?

1377
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:29,900
You don't want to prevent them.

1378
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,500
I'm from Staten.

1379
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,000
You don't want to make it so that it collides when it gets to here.

1380
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,100
That doesn't make any sense.

1381
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:34,200
Right?

1382
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:38,500
Because in, since these things kind of overlap, you want them to be

1383
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,400
able to get overlapping in in why like that, if that makes sense.

1384
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,000
So I think this is basically what we want.

1385
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,900
The only thing that I was pointing out that we need to do is the the

1386
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:50,800
we need to start.

1387
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,900
When we do our renderer.

1388
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,700
We need to do that sort of sorting by y, so that we can make sure that

1389
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:56,200
we draw.

1390
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,500
When you go behind something, you draw behind it instead of in front

1391
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,400
of it right now.

1392
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,800
It's just drawing.

1393
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,900
Whatever order to the entities come in, right and that's not very

1394
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,400
useful.

1395
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,000
But the Collision is working properly.

1396
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,700
How good is this addressing scheme for the cash?

1397
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,600
It's not very good right now.

1398
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,100
Well, I mean, I don't know how good is right now because I haven't

1399
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:18,500
tested it, but it's not very good right now.

1400
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,000
It's not good for the cash or for CMD operations.

1401
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,100
So, I don't, like I said, I don't expect.

1402
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,000
We will store things exactly this way, when we kind of get to the end

1403
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,400
of the, of the tunnel, if you will, when we would actually do some of

1404
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,000
those operations.

1405
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,700
I don't know.

1406
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,200
But like right now, if you're looking

1407
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,200
For cash friendliness.

1408
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,400
This is not going to be your friend at the moment, but you but also

1409
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,400
right now, we don't really want to be optimal in cash - because we

1410
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,900
don't even really know exactly how all of our operations work.

1411
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,500
So until we do, we can't really think about the cash very well.

1412
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:06,300
When jumping you just need XYZ coordinates to make it happen.

1413
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,200
Question mark.

1414
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,900
Yeah.

1415
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,300
I mean, jumping is just.

1416
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,600
Like we don't have a z coordinate for our guy.

1417
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,300
Well, I mean you can

1418
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,100
Yeah, I mean, I'm trying to think of what the easiest way.

1419
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:29,700
Like, so jumping is just is just someone who gets some upward velocity

1420
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,100
and then and has gravity, right?

1421
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:34,500
I mean, if we had 3D vectors, which I don't really want to throw in

1422
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,899
right now, but you could do it.

1423
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:40,600
I mean, one way to think about it would just be, you know, if you

1424
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,899
wanted to do jumping you just say, okay.

1425
01:08:43,899 --> 01:08:47,800
There's there's like a z value here, right in high-end stereo or

1426
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,700
something like that.

1427
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,100
And when you draw the guy,

1428
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,600
The place that you're going to draw him, like the player ground point

1429
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,300
or whatever.

1430
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:58,500
You just go ahead and say we're going to offset it by whatever the

1431
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,800
high end, it easy value.

1432
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:06,600
Right, and so if I do that, let me see here.

1433
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,500
If I do that right, then I should get exactly the same thing I had

1434
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:12,600
before, right?

1435
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,000
But now if I go ahead and actually jump it, although you know, what,

1436
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,899
let me, let me, let me do it in a slightly different place to let me

1437
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:25,100
do it actually here just like that, right?

1438
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,500
Okay.

1439
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,399
So now if you take a look at this, right?

1440
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,500
If we were to change that high entity Z.

1441
01:09:31,899 --> 01:09:37,600
So let's say we took High entity Z and made it equal to, you know, to

1442
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:39,200
We're for something like this.

1443
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:39,899
Right?

1444
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:43,899
And we still need I guess I should also point out, we need to do.

1445
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,300
We need to do Z equals.

1446
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:48,800
High entity.

1447
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,200
See,

1448
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,700
Like so, and we need to change that m 2 pics.

1449
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,700
So there we go.

1450
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,100
So we got our high into d z, so I'm going to make that a z.

1451
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,400
So we're going to offset the bitmaps Y by Z.

1452
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,800
Okay, and I can't remember.

1453
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,100
So we're actually doing our flip here and then the drawbitmap expects,

1454
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,200
the calls pre flipped.

1455
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,300
Is that correct?

1456
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,400
Yeah, that's correct.

1457
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,100
So really the Z value is also negated, right?

1458
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,800
Because it's going upwards for positive Z.

1459
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,000
So, now you can see the guys like offset.

1460
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,300
Maury should be right.

1461
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,200
And he's like a meter above or two meters above Race, should be or

1462
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:24,500
something.

1463
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,100
Right?

1464
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,900
So, there's there's where he is.

1465
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,800
So, if we wanted to now, we could totally make the dude Jump by just

1466
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,700
having right of velocity in Z.

1467
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,600
That's all we would need to do and hopefully it's clear like how that

1468
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,000
would work.

1469
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:39,400
Right?

1470
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:43,200
It would work by going, you know, for each entity.

1471
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,600
The high entity Z, we have the, you know, remember the equations of

1472
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,200
motion.

1473
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,100
So the equations of motion that we had up here, right?

1474
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,100
To remember these guys.

1475
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,200
They're exactly the same if we wanted to do Z, right.

1476
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,900
So you would just do exactly this.

1477
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:04,200
You'd basically have whatever the Delta Z is.

1478
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,800
So this is the Delta Z.

1479
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:14,600
It's going to be the square of the time step and then it's going to be

1480
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:21,800
whatever the Z velocity is times that like so on and the ddz, right?

1481
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:23,300
So this is the acceleration.

1482
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,500
This is the velocity and then we've got that Delta Z.

1483
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:34,500
So and to update this, we just have to take again that and

1484
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:35,900
T.

1485
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,000
What's up, right?

1486
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,700
So that would be read up.

1487
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:49,900
You update the Z exactly the same way as we were updating everything

1488
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:50,200
else.

1489
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,000
That's why I say we could we should just use three-dimensional

1490
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,100
coordinates really but you know, you'd update the jump Z exactly that

1491
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,800
way and then what you do is

1492
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:06,200
Okay, you know the high the this is the Delta Z.

1493
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:06,900
There we go.

1494
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,200
We don't want the high entities, easy to ever be less than zero or

1495
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,500
whatever.

1496
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,700
The ground height is will stay at zero for now.

1497
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:19,100
So off we go and then we need, whatever the acceleration is in Z and

1498
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,300
of course the acceleration in Z is negative 9.8 meters per second

1499
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,400
squared, right?

1500
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:29,900
Because that's the speed of gravity and the DT is going to be

1501
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,500
Whatever that what our game input is rdt for frame, right?

1502
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,400
There is our GT per frame.

1503
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,500
DT for fraying.

1504
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,300
Let's see.

1505
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,600
It is a frame.

1506
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,900
To, here we go.

1507
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,000
So the DZ is the high entity DC.

1508
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,100
So there we go.

1509
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,400
And so I think that should now give us our dude.

1510
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,000
Okay, so he doesn't have any Z velocity right now.

1511
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,000
And so all we really need to do is give him some Z velocity.

1512
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:14,600
So if we went into our code here when we, when we do our controller

1513
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,700
check, if we, you know, went and said, all right.

1514
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:26,000
If if action up and down then we'll just say that whatever entity this

1515
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,100
is controlling entity High DZ equals.

1516
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:34,100
He's got some, you know, he's just got some velocity right that

1517
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:34,900
upward.

1518
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,300
Right, and that's probably a bit too high of a jump to say, the very

1519
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:40,900
least.

1520
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:41,700
So there we go.

1521
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,600
That's probably too little of a jump.

1522
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,000
So, there we go.

1523
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:47,600
Right.

1524
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,100
And off you go.

1525
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,800
So that's, that's really all.

1526
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,100
It's literally the same equations of motion for last time just with

1527
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:58,900
gravity in there.

1528
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,700
And if you don't like, you know, obviously the speed of gravity,

1529
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:03,800
that's fine too.

1530
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:09,100
You know, I didn't actually check to see very carefully whether I had

1531
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:11,800
done it properly, but I think everything should be correct here,

1532
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,400
right?

1533
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:13,800
Whatever the square of the time.

1534
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,400
Step is blah, blah blah, right.

1535
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:17,000
And

1536
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,400
Yeah, and we're adding in.

1537
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:24,200
Now, the question of like, depending on the perspective.

1538
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,900
This is, this is not really a correct.

1539
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,600
This is not really correct here.

1540
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,100
It's really hard to say.

1541
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:36,800
But yeah, you can then tweak these values if you wanted us, you know,

1542
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,200
a stronger jump value.

1543
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,300
So he jumps quicker or not as fast or whatever, right?

1544
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,400
But that's, that's it.

1545
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,200
I mean, that's all jumping is and so hopefully, you can see how that

1546
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:46,500
worked.

1547
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,000
It's exactly the same stuff we did from,

1548
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,900
Or this is just the equations of motion.

1549
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,400
Here's the update to the position.

1550
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
In fact, we don't really need Delta Z in there at all.

1551
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,600
You could just look at it this way, right?

1552
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,700
So the new p is just equal to, right is equal to one half.

1553
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:12,300
Ay t squared plus T times V.

1554
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,000
Right?

1555
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:16,200
So there's the acceleration, there's the 1/2, there's the squared

1556
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,800
time.

1557
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,300
Just like we did equations of motion.

1558
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:23,800
Here's the T times the velocity because there's the velocity, right?

1559
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,200
And here's the original position, P Prime.

1560
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,900
And then the update to the velocity is just

1561
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,600
Just okay, whatever the velocity, whatever the acceleration was times

1562
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,000
the time, step, plus, whatever the velocity was before, and then this

1563
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,200
just prevents them from falling through the ground, right?

1564
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,800
So that's the equations of motion for jumping and there really isn't

1565
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,700
anything else to it.

1566
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:50,100
I mean, that's, that's that's all there is and that again, if you want

1567
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,800
to tweak those constants at fine, but that'll give him the parabolic

1568
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,000
arc as well.

1569
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,700
Now I can double jump or triple jump, right?

1570
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,700
Because we haven't done anything to prevent that.

1571
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,800
So I can kind of fly him quite quite a ways away from where he should

1572
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,200
be.

1573
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,600
But you know, what did I do?

1574
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:15,400
So yeah, I don't know that we I guess we can leave that in there for

1575
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:15,900
now.

1576
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,800
We'll pull it out later, but that's jumping.

1577
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,300
Will be switched to some kind of sparse storage, for example, for the

1578
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:28,200
high-res entities.

1579
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,700
Yes, that's my plan.

1580
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,600
So my plan is basically to have like a small array of high-res

1581
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,600
entities and a large array of doorman entities.

1582
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,900
And I don't know if we'll have like a low.

1583
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:43,900
If I have a separate storage for low or whether the low will just be

1584
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,300
stuff that is operating on the dormant.

1585
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:48,100
We'll have to see.

1586
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,000
So I'm not sure.

1587
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,300
How would you handle jumping on a ledge or Surface to adopt a new base

1588
01:16:59,300 --> 01:16:59,800
height?

1589
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,300
Well, I mean, you know, it depends on what you're trying to do.

1590
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:11,200
In this particular case, if I, you know, if I was going to do

1591
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:20,200
If I was going to pack it in here, it would look very different than

1592
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,300
if I was trying to do something where I was really making a

1593
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:22,900
platformer.

1594
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:26,500
Like this is not a game where people jump like he will not really jump

1595
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,100
in the game.

1596
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,500
He just going to bounce around as part of his animation.

1597
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,400
So he's not he's never going to jump in gameplay terms.

1598
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,300
He's only jumping visibly, right?

1599
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,700
Just kind of just a little hop.

1600
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,100
So, I'm not really thinking about that too much, but you could imagine

1601
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:47,700
making it so that, you know, tiles, the different entities had

1602
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:48,200
Heights.

1603
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,300
And if he was above that height, then you would go ahead and set his

1604
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,400
base Z like you would basically say, what am I standing on?

1605
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,300
What's its Z and that's my base Z value.

1606
01:17:59,600 --> 01:17:59,800
I mean,

1607
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,200
That's one way you could do it, but I'd have to it would be dependent

1608
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,500
largely on what the game was and what I was trying to do.

1609
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,600
So, I'm not sure I can really give a very good answer.

1610
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,500
This is kind of funny.

1611
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:12,900
Yeah.

1612
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,200
What do you think about physics for character or mob movement in a

1613
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:25,700
platformer game meaning that I press, right, but it start to

1614
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,300
accelerate instead of just move.

1615
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:30,800
So I like that feeling, that's the way I'm doing it here.

1616
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,900
You'll notice that the guy has some startup time and some slow down

1617
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,000
time, and I like that feel.

1618
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I don't like instantaneous on instantaneous off.

1619
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,100
It doesn't feel good to me.

1620
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,500
But that is a preference thing, right?

1621
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:48,300
That's, that's what do you like your game?

1622
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,600
I feel like kind of a thing and it also is a design decision, like

1623
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,600
some games.

1624
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,200
Want a little more swimmy, feel in the controls and some want more

1625
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,800
Precision.

1626
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:06,000
So, I would say you can have to think about if you know, you'd have to

1627
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,400
think about what you want.

1628
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,600
Now make him jump through the ceiling into the next floor.

1629
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,000
Really?

1630
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,200
I don't really want to do that.

1631
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,500
I cuz we're not set up.

1632
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,500
This is not the appropriate place to be doing that kind of thing.

1633
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,900
I mean, we'd have to say how high the thing should be.

1634
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,600
Yeah, I don't want to do that right now.

1635
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,000
Why is he so huge?

1636
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,500
Well, because we haven't really scaled him down to how big we want to

1637
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:02,600
me, but it doesn't matter because we don't, you know, we're not really

1638
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,200
at this age where we care about that.

1639
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,900
So I kind of like him giant.

1640
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,900
But yeah, he'll be a bit smaller.

1641
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:12,900
I suppose he's really giant if we do this, but yeah, we will.

1642
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,600
It's kind of funny when he jumps.

1643
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,200
Anyway.

1644
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,800
Will the floor area of the zones be flat or will it have slopes and 3D

1645
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,300
zones?

1646
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,100
A Cahill's?

1647
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:39,600
Flat always the reason that I decided I wanted to always be flat is

1648
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,500
because I don't like the way Hills work in 2D games.

1649
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:44,700
Really?

1650
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,500
They always annoy me.

1651
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:51,600
I'm just always found them really, really annoying like either.

1652
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,500
They don't work the way you expect them to, and it's annoying or they

1653
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,000
do work the way you expect them to.

1654
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:57,100
And

1655
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:57,600
Are annoying.

1656
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,900
Like both cases are annoying.

1657
01:20:59,000 --> 01:20:59,800
One way is like.

1658
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,000
I'm at the top of the hill and I'm trying to shoot down at someone and

1659
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,300
I can't because like, the shot hits the ground or one of the other

1660
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:07,500
end.

1661
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,900
Like it's annoying or like it doesn't do that.

1662
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,700
And so I think the enemy can't shoot me from there, but he can, like,

1663
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,000
I don't know.

1664
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,100
I just, I'm never satisfied with hills.

1665
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:19,200
They just don't seem to work into, like, in 3D, they work fine.

1666
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,000
Because it's all kind of in a consistent environment.

1667
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,700
But in 2D because you have this sort of hybrid of like, well, things

1668
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,800
are sort of drawn in 3D, but but, you know, we it's not real.

1669
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,200
A prospective and it's not really transformed.

1670
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,400
You get you just get these conditions that I don't like and so I just

1671
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,600
I flat out said there's no Hills.

1672
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:42,500
I think yangshin would prefer that there were Hills but there's not

1673
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:43,100
gonna be any Hills.

1674
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:45,900
There will be over hanging stuff.

1675
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So there will be a clue ders like like arches and stuff that you go

1676
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,900
through and stuff like that.

1677
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,000
I think there will be those, but there will not be Hills.

1678
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Can you change the yellow tile beneath his feet quickly and easily to

1679
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,700
be grayish and round.

1680
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,100
So, it looks like a jumping Shadow, completely not required, but why

1681
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,700
not?

1682
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,600
Yeah, I mean obviously you could do that.

1683
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:36,200
So, what you would want to do for that?

1684
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,900
So we've got the draw rectangle call.

1685
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,500
Right.

1686
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:49,200
And really probably what you'd want to do is call drawbitmap instead.

1687
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:57,500
So like what you would do did we put a shadow already in the data

1688
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,500
directory, though?

1689
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,900
So there's already a shadow, right?

1690
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:15,000
So we could do is just say instead of drawing.

1691
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,700
If you don't like that rectangle, you could just go ahead and close it

1692
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:29,400
out and say that you wanted to draw game State Shadow and

1693
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,500
And that just be, that just be fine.

1694
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,200
Yeah.

1695
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,400
So yeah, you get the idea.

1696
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,400
So you would basically say that there's a shadow here, and then when

1697
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,900
we load the backdrop, right?

1698
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,900
We'd just do

1699
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,400
Something like this, right?

1700
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,200
Test here.

1701
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:51,700
Oh shit.

1702
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
And see.

1703
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,300
Do that, right?

1704
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:03,900
All right.

1705
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,400
There you go.

1706
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,100
So there's the shadow, right?

1707
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,300
And, oh, right.

1708
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,900
I forgot that doesn't move.

1709
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,800
So the shadow should not move.

1710
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,300
The shadow should just be there, right?

1711
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,800
So then he's jumping right, but what you really you want that we don't

1712
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
have scaling in our rendering yet.

1713
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:38,600
So you would want that to shrink that shadow to shrink and so we could

1714
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,400
approximate that that affect by multiplying through by the alpha.

1715
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:47,300
And we're really getting off topic here people, but you know,

1716
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:50,500
Why not?

1717
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,000
So if we add a c Alpha in here, right?

1718
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,400
So we basically multiply our Alpha value by some other value when we

1719
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,100
come through here and we pick up the a value, right?

1720
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:05,600
We can go ahead and say that a x equals the C Alpha if we if we did

1721
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,900
that, then you can notice nothing changes.

1722
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,300
But if we then go in here and make that proportional to r z value,

1723
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:14,300
right?

1724
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,700
So when we draw the shadow will pass

1725
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:21,800
That c Alpha value through here.

1726
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,200
And then what we do is we say that the C Alpha value equals, you know,

1727
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:31,400
1.0 f- whatever the entities Z is so that when he gets higher the

1728
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,700
alpha value gets less, right?

1729
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,600
And then a c Alpha.

1730
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,900
We just make sure that if that's greater than I'm sorry, if that's

1731
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,900
less than 0, we clamp it, right.

1732
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,800
So it doesn't get less than zero and then you can kind of see

1733
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,700
Right, it feels a little more, right?

1734
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,900
You know, this this is this is pretty, we're playing it pretty fast

1735
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:02,500
and loose here, but you can kind of, you know, gives a little bit

1736
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:07,400
better feel, but we'd want to scale it down as well as what we're

1737
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:07,900
doing here.

1738
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,000
So so there you go.

1739
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,500
That's there's a shadow for you.

1740
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
If you wanted to Shadow, you got a shadow.

1741
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,600
If you add walls in the middle of rooms, would they be handled as

1742
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,500
entities to the perfect of collision detection or separately?

1743
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,700
So what we're going to do I think and like I said, this is just me

1744
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,000
playing around but I'm pretty sure we're going to do and this is what

1745
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,500
I'm trying.

1746
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,700
That's what we do tomorrow is everything's going to be entities in the

1747
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:38,500
active play field.

1748
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,200
So all the trees will be entities.

1749
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:41,800
The walls will be entities.

1750
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,900
Everything will be entities.

1751
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:48,600
And when you move off the screen, they'll get moved back to the city

1752
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,200
of town map.

1753
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,400
Let's see.

1754
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,100
She's too fast.

1755
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:07,800
What is too fast?

1756
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,500
The, the, the the fading out too fast.

1757
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,100
I should just quickly say what I did there for in case you meant to

1758
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,100
faster the explanation.

1759
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,900
So the person wanted to Shadow, right?

1760
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:23,100
So all I did was I just loaded a shadow bitmap that we had and I put

1761
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,200
it down there, right?

1762
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,900
And so instead of drawing a rectangle.

1763
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,800
I draw through the shadow bitmap, but when he gets further away from

1764
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,600
the ground,

1765
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:37,900
You know, a shadow is caused by the Light that's coming in is getting

1766
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,100
blocked by the person who's standing there.

1767
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:45,300
And so it can't hit the ground, but as he jumps, there's he's when

1768
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,000
he's further away from the ground, more light is able to get in at

1769
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,200
that ground patch that he is, you know, so that he's no longer really

1770
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:55,600
including that area.

1771
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,100
Right?

1772
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,200
And so as he jumped higher, I was just saying, oh, well, you know, the

1773
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,100
shadow area should get smaller and we don't really have

1774
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,500
The ability to scaling right now, but we do did have the ability to do

1775
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,400
right, is our drawbitmap function does alpha blending.

1776
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,300
So we already know that we have the ability to make things essentially

1777
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,200
translucent, right?

1778
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:18,500
I mean we could make things translucent by just only blending, right?

1779
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,300
Half the value, right?

1780
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,900
You can see that happening right here, right?

1781
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:24,500
If that makes sense.

1782
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,200
So because we have Alpha blending.

1783
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:33,400
That means we have the ability to change how much of our source gets

1784
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,500
written into the destination.

1785
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,500
Because we were already doing this Alpha blend right here.

1786
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:40,200
We, this was the alpha blend.

1787
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,900
That takes the source and the destination and blends them using the

1788
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,300
linear.

1789
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,000
Again, that linear blend equation that I said would be underpinning,

1790
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
everything and always is that linear.

1791
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,700
Blend equation is blending between our source and our destination.

1792
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:55,200
So it's blending between the guy and the trees, the forest bitmap in

1793
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:55,400
the back.

1794
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,600
On there, right?

1795
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,100
So all I did is said, well, okay.

1796
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,500
We were reading that Alpha out of the guys Alpha Channel and that's

1797
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,500
what we were using to determine whether or not, you know, each pixel.

1798
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,400
How how much each pixel would be there.

1799
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:12,100
So that that way where the guy isn't we weren't writing any pixel data

1800
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,900
and where he is we were and at the edges we were writing a, you know,

1801
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,200
proportion of, right.

1802
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,400
It's the thing that, you know, if I zoom in here, I don't know if the

1803
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:21,700
zooming work still, yeah.

1804
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:24,500
Can you how much can you zoom in?

1805
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,400
Can you, there we go.

1806
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,500
You can zoom in a lot.

1807
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,300
That's kind of handy.

1808
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,100
So you can kind of see right there like all around the edges of them

1809
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:31,800
to write that.

1810
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,700
The alpha blending is what's giving us that feathered Edge as well.

1811
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:35,100
Right?

1812
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,600
We wouldn't be able to feather the edge with the background without

1813
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,400
the alpha blending.

1814
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,000
So I just thought quick and I was like, oh, well if I want the shadow

1815
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,800
to kind of diminish as he jumps, well, that's the one thing I have to

1816
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,500
work with is the alpha blending.

1817
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,600
So I said, well, let's go ahead and just pass in a coefficient for the

1818
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,300
alpha here that I can pass from 0 to 1.

1819
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,600
And that will multiply whatever the incoming Alpha is.

1820
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,500
And when it multiplies, whatever the incoming Alpha is, if I set it to

1821
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:08,100
like .5, then everything would be half Blended path is as opaque.

1822
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,800
.25 would be a quarter is a pig, right?

1823
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,600
As it should be.

1824
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,500
And so that lets us very the translucency of things.

1825
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,700
Right programmatically.

1826
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,100
And again, we like I said, we already wrote all the code for that.

1827
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,500
All I did was just passing the coefficient.

1828
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,600
That's all I did.

1829
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:26,100
And that was just to go ahead and get the shadow, too.

1830
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,600
Do that little dimming effect.

1831
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,300
That's it.

1832
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,600
Hopefully, that makes sense.

1833
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,600
How much has changing the rectangle to a bitmap is set of a rectangle

1834
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,700
impacted your player on player Collision calculation.

1835
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,300
It doesn't the player Collision clack.

1836
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,300
Calculation will always be done on something other than bitmaps,

1837
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:46,000
basically.

1838
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,600
So the bitmaps are purely what we draw.

1839
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:58,700
how many zombie DLC is, will there be well, I mean,

1840
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,100
I don't know that we want to do zombies DLCs.

1841
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:10,600
Because obviously, the most important thing in gaming is monetizing

1842
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,200
the player.

1843
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:13,700
Like, you don't want to think about stuff, like whether the players

1844
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,600
having a good time, or whether the game is fun or whether you had an

1845
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,300
artistic statement to make that you wanted to make, or whether you

1846
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,300
loved it or any of those things which you want to think about is how

1847
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,800
to maximize profits.

1848
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,400
And so zombie DLCs.

1849
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,900
I don't think we're going to be able to squeeze the whales with that,

1850
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:28,500
right?

1851
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:30,200
I think what we really need here.

1852
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,400
We need a bigger Harpoon, right?

1853
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,500
We need a harpoon, the whales of something bigger.

1854
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:37,100
So I'm thinking, like, zombie DLC.

1855
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,700
I'm sorry, zombie.

1856
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:40,800
Microtransactions is what I'm thinking.

1857
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,800
So, basically, what we do is we charge 99 cents per zombie.

1858
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,200
And since we know zombies come in hordes, if the player wants to have

1859
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:49,500
any fun at all, they'll have to buy like a ton of them.

1860
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:53,300
And then handmade here I will just be like astronomically profitable.

1861
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,100
Um, and that's the real important thing obviously.

1862
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,000
Shouldn't you be doing this blending in a linear Colour space?

1863
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:11,500
Yes, and that is something we will talk about Gamma.

1864
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,100
In fact, you want to see something that I have when we talked about

1865
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:15,000
Gamma before?

1866
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,100
And I was lamenting that I couldn't find anything.

1867
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,100
Well, guess, what?

1868
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:24,300
My monitor actually came with its tested gamma curve.

1869
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,300
You can actually see.

1870
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:29,400
It's Candelas per meter squared here on the graph, right?

1871
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:34,000
And if you can see that, can you see that?

1872
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,900
So, yeah, I, when we get there, we actually have the monitor gamma

1873
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:43,700
curve on a piece of paper, which is kind of fun.

1874
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,700
But yeah, that's that's up to talk about in the render.

1875
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:50,600
We're not there yet.

1876
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,700
We're not at linear versus srgb color spaces or any of that stuff.

1877
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,700
So we're not thinking about that yet.

1878
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,100
Let's see.

1879
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,200
When does the core mechanics of The Game come into play earlier, later

1880
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,000
in the day of cycle?

1881
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:11,800
So

1882
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,400
On handmade hero.

1883
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,300
It is coming later in the dev cycle than it would ordinarily come.

1884
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:25,300
Because this is a very educational project and so I'm focusing on

1885
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,500
teaching different parts different times.

1886
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:32,100
Normally I would put the card game mechanics in right away.

1887
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:38,700
They already would have been in right, but that is not really the

1888
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,500
primary goal of this game.

1889
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,800
The primary goal of this game is not game designed its game

1890
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,600
programming.

1891
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,900
And so, we will be going through a number of things before we start

1892
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:50,500
talking about core game mechanics because we're not

1893
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,200
Iterate on core game mechanics are trying to iterate on game code

1894
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:55,200
which is different.

1895
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,100
And so yeah, I'm making concessions to the fact that it's trying to be

1896
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:02,200
more education about programming if that makes sense.

1897
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:06,800
So, basically game mechanics will come in.

1898
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,900
After we finish, the renderer probably.

1899
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:16,800
Our rough road map is finish the rough version of everything is what

1900
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,700
we're doing right now, which isn't that long, maybe a couple more

1901
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:29,100
weeks after that we will go do Collision detection rendering and audio

1902
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:35,000
output, right sound effects and music and so the game will then be

1903
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,500
looking and and sounding properly, but there will be no game to play.

1904
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:41,500
And then

1905
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:44,400
We will switch over to the game mechanics and we'll just go

1906
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,800
continuously with game mechanics from then on out because we got a lot

1907
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:48,200
of them.

1908
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,800
We got to do World Generation.

1909
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,800
We have to do like entity systems and like interactions and ton of

1910
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,400
objects and all that sort of stuff.

1911
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,700
So yeah.

1912
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:02,900
Well, basically, you know, will spend a few months on engine stuff and

1913
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,300
then we'll switch over game mechanics and just I planted that's just

1914
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,700
stay on game, mechanics lien the entire time from then on.

1915
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,200
Is there an easy way to translate from Circle to ellipse Collision

1916
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,500
detection by?

1917
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,800
I'm not sure what that means Mankowski.

1918
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,800
Will let you do a lips Collision detection.

1919
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,500
Just fine.

1920
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,000
It's a little bit more work than Circle, but not much.

1921
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,300
So, I'm sorry.

1922
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:45,800
I'm not sure.

1923
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,000
I totally understand the question, though.

1924
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,800
Did you ever learn to make a game engine rather than using engines

1925
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,400
like Unity or unreal for people new to game development?

1926
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,600
Well, it depends on what you want to do.

1927
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,700
You want to be a game programmer?

1928
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:03,600
Yes, I do.

1929
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
If you want to just be a game designer, then it probably isn't

1930
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,800
necessary.

1931
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,300
Although I would recommend gaining some familiarity with it.

1932
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,700
Meaning like, you know, watching this series or something and just

1933
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:20,800
kind of seeing what goes on and maybe not having to learn everything,

1934
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:25,000
but just understanding sort of the things that are going on underneath

1935
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:29,900
the hood are very good to know, even as someone.

1936
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,300
Who's primarily a game design programmer, rather than a game engine

1937
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:33,900
programmer?

1938
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:38,900
But, you know, you certainly wouldn't need to learn how to write a

1939
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:42,600
render yourself, but it would probably be good for you to understand

1940
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:44,700
how a renderer works, right?

1941
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,900
And so, what I would say is, it's it's all stuff that everyone should

1942
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:53,300
know, but it it's a it's a matter of what degree, you need to know it,

1943
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,100
right?

1944
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,400
You know how much of each section do you just have a vague

1945
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:04,100
understanding of how render works or do you know how to write one

1946
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,700
yourself?

1947
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,900
If you're always going to be focusing on mostly doing game, design

1948
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:10,200
programming, and you're never going to write your own game engine,

1949
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,000
then you probably don't really need to be able to make an engine, make

1950
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:14,500
a renderer.

1951
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:15,100
Right?

1952
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,900
But it would help you to know how one works and what's involved,

1953
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:20,900
because you're constantly involved with those systems when you're

1954
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,900
doing game design, and they constantly imply important.

1955
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,700
Structions and opportunities for you in your design and not having any

1956
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,100
idea what's going on is constantly a hindrance.

1957
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:36,500
So, yeah, so what I would say is it's all good information for

1958
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,200
everybody who's involved in games, but the degree to which you really

1959
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,800
need to under internalized, it varies, widely, depending on what you

1960
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,500
plan to do.

1961
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,700
The rectangle box, which you have Alpha assigned?

1962
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,400
Is that the same box you would assign hit points to in case the

1963
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,900
character is injured by enemies or obstacles.

1964
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:00,300
I don't know.

1965
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:05,000
So, like some games, like, Legend of Zelda.

1966
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I believe is just sprite-based Collision detection.

1967
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,500
So it's just whether the Sprite gets hit.

1968
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:14,300
Whereas I think Binding of Isaac is actually sort of positional.

1969
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:20,500
So so it's very 3D like like basically if a shot, you know, past

1970
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,200
Kind you like that?

1971
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:25,800
It wouldn't, you know, or I guess I could do it with the properly

1972
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,800
included version here.

1973
01:38:28,500 --> 01:38:30,700
If a shot past behind you, it wouldn't hit you here.

1974
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:31,600
Whereas in Zelda.

1975
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,200
It would I don't know which one of those is better.

1976
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,000
This one is more realistic, but it's not necessarily more

1977
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,700
understandable for the player because then they have to kind of do

1978
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:46,200
this Fuzzy Math of like, looking at the where the shadow is.

1979
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,300
And so, I don't know, like,

1980
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:52,500
for this game.

1981
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,500
I really think I'm just going to have to try both of them and see

1982
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,000
which one feels better once the game is actually running and were

1983
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,700
playing.

1984
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,800
Game, I think we'll have to feel it just and see.

1985
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,400
How common are practical is pixel by pixel Collision.

1986
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,300
Check versus overall shapes going to check, which one is more

1987
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:12,000
interesting to you?

1988
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,400
So pixel by pixel is totally doable.

1989
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,500
We could do it.

1990
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:20,000
The problem is it doesn't handle swept volumes very well.

1991
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:25,700
So things can tunnel with pixel by pixel clothes and checks in ways

1992
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:27,000
that you don't necessarily want them to.

1993
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,400
So that's the impracticality part of it.

1994
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:35,900
So what I would typically say is Go polygonal and use a fairly tight

1995
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:39,200
polygon because that's almost indistinguishable from Pixel by pixel

1996
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,600
and can do swept volumes.

1997
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,100
That's what I would say.

1998
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,200
What are your thoughts on the Allegro Library?

1999
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,400
I have never heard of or seen such light said Library.

2000
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,600
So I cannot comment.

2001
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,300
All right, I think we are done.

2002
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,900
This dream has ended if I'm not very much an error.

2003
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,400
Let's go ahead and close this all down.

2004
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:12,900
Well, yes, we are a little over time, but we're still, you know, it's

2005
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,400
so it all kind of fits together.

2006
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,700
It's fluid, what time we end and what time we start.

2007
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,400
Thank you everyone for joining me for another episode of

2008
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,600
Make sure it has been a pleasure programming with you.

2009
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,000
As always, basically.

2010
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:29,200
If you are the sort of person who likes to follow along with the

2011
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,100
source code at home.

2012
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:34,500
You can pre-order the game at handmade here a.org and it comes with

2013
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,300
the source code.

2014
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,200
You can just go ahead and download it, and then you can play around

2015
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,900
with it yourself, change the jumping speed.

2016
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,300
For example, if you want a faster jump or a slower jumper a higher

2017
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,400
jump, even you could do that among other things.

2018
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,300
So, if you want to do that, handmade here at or

2019
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,100
look, this is the handy, dandy period of button and you'll be able to

2020
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:55,600
download the source every night and of course the test assets as well.

2021
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,700
And it'll obviously get you the the game when it's when it's ready.

2022
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,700
If you want to support the video series.

2023
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:01,400
We have a patreon.

2024
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,900
You can subscribe to that's over here and we have a news and Forum

2025
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,500
site, which is pretty sweet.

2026
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,200
I highly recommend you check it out.

2027
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,100
It's got the schedule for the week posted.

2028
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:14,000
It's got an episode guy that has all the past episodes with like time

2029
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,300
markers and good stuff.

2030
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,900
It's really much easier to follow on there.

2031
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,900
If you're trying to catch up.

2032
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,200
We have a coding resources page and the coding resources page has

2033
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,700
ports to Linux and Mac already, that other people have done.

2034
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,300
So, if you're trying to run on a different system, besides Windows,

2035
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:27,800
that's your that's your go-to place.

2036
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,900
They've got it all up there.

2037
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,400
And finally, there's a Code discussion forum where you can ask

2038
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:37,000
questions about the game, the game code as it stands, or if you find

2039
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,300
problems or trying to get things compiling and you can't or whatever.

2040
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,300
That's the place to go.

2041
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,600
A lot of helpful people and I answer questions on there, too.

2042
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,000
So, thank you very much for joining me.

2043
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I hope to see you back here tomorrow night, 8.

2044
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,300
P.m.

2045
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,200
Pacific Standard time.

2046
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:55,300
Again, we will have a delightful time and we will start looking at

2047
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,300
pushing this a little further and getting our walls and stuff and

2048
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,800
maybe we'll start trying to trees.

2049
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:00,800
I don't know.

2050
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,900
We have a lot of things we could do and they're all cool.

2051
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,600
So I hope to see you back here as the game starts to take shape.

2052
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,500
I'm pretty excited.

2053
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,100
I think for a start we're getting closer to that cusp.

2054
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,100
Yeah, do the render.

2055
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,100
That's a big one.

2056
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,100
So obviously it'll take us a few weeks to do a render.

2057
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:16,700
I'm sure.

2058
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:20,500
But that's one of the last big things before we start, start being an

2059
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:21,600
in-game town for real.

2060
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,900
So I'm pretty excited.

2061
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:24,600
Thank you so much for joining me.

2062
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,800
I hope to see you tomorrow and have a wonderful Wednesday whether I do

2063
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:29,900
or

2064
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:30,600
Or not.

2065
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:31,500
Thanks, everyone.
