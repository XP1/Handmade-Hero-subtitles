00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,600
The show we could have complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,300
We are covering some animation topics today and we have been for the

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,100
past few days, just talking about the various ways that you can

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:20,600
Implement animation in your code and yesterday we showed how to do

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,100
some.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,400
Well, let me go ahead and give you the sort of the idea of where we

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,100
left off yesterday, in terms of how to do animations stuff.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,700
Let's go ahead and Jump Right In by

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,400
Wait, today is day 274, so, if you are following along at home at the

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,200
code, you will want to start with day, 273 source code.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
That is what I am starting with right now.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,500
So here is the state of our handmade Hero at the moment.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
Where we are working on getting him moving.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,000
So you can see we are working on just his body jump.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
And you can see there's a couple different things that we've done

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,200
there, right?

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,300
And we've sort of added some anticipation to it.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,400
We have a nice little parabolic Arc in there and there's some landing.

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,800
And it's starting to look somewhat respectable.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,900
Obviously, like I said, we still have a bunch of stuff to do with

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,500
respect to leaning, so that we're going to attach the head to the body

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,300
and a couple of the things like that.

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,900
So, you know, we're not we're not done by any stretch of the

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,500
imagination.

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:24,700
He is.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,100
Supposed to be a severed head but we're getting we're getting further

28
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,100
along towards where we need to be but we haven't really covered all

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,800
the things in a mission that I wanted to cover.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
So like I've kind of been piecing them out.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
As we eat, do each one and write the code for each one of these.

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,500
And what I wanted to point out to you here, as you look at at at this

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,900
is, if I go ahead and slow down our time, step a bit

34
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,700
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to slow down the entire time step

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,800
and you know what we probably could do as well.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,300
If we wanted to is, we could make the time step an actual controlling

37
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,699
like a variable that we can control you know like we could do

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,000
something like I don't know.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,800
In the simulation we could say that there's a debug our 32 which is

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,500
like Global like timestep percentage or something like this and what

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,500
And say, oops.

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,500
what we could say there is if in,

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,200
If we essentially tweak some variable cure that will call Global time

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
step percentage.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
If we tweak some variable will start off the variable at 100% let's

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,000
say and will you know will allow ourselves to tweak it to whatever we

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
want and when we get our dt4 frame so when we come in here you know we

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,100
have the input, you can see in game update and render, right?

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
We have this concept of

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,800
UT for frame Loops, which is how we determine how much time has gone

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,200
by.

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,700
Looks like we're not actually even using it in here, but I'm going to

53
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,900
do it in here so that it affects everybody.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,100
So what I want to do here is say OK for our stimulation.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,300
When we come in here and we get this, the input dt4 frame.

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,300
I'm going to go ahead and multiply it by whatever the global time

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,600
step.

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,000
Oops.

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,100
Global time step percentages.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Hello, why am I stuck in the menus?

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,700
Thank you, windows little time, step percentage.

62
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,200
I'm going to multiply it by global time step percentage and and I am

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
going to divide that by 100 so that it's 12:45.

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,400
And now we can adjust that percentage.

65
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,300
However, we want, and it will sort of control what sort of a Time step

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,400
we're taking if that makes sense.

67
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh wait, you don't have to do, be 32.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
You just do value for these guys.

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,800
It's only pools that needed it.

70
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,400
So you know now I've got sort of thing where I'm, you know, moving my

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
guy around and if I want to sort of slow that down so I can see it a

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
little bit better.

73
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,900
I should be able to take this and just kind of like drop it down.

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,000
Like 50 would be like half speed right?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,200
And like 25% speed so now I'm like real slow.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,300
So here you can kind of see what it looks like when the dudes hopping

77
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,200
around and there's a little hot back and forth, right?

78
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,800
And so it's starting to look okay, you know, it's got some animation

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
quality in there and it's doing okay.

80
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,700
But what I wanted to point out and because what I we're going to focus

81
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,300
on today is this part right here where you notice, it looks kind of

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,400
look, sort of reasonable when I'm just hopping when it's, you know,

83
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,500
going from one to the other.

84
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,100
But if I was to continue on, so I'm going to now go across two

85
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,700
squares.

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,500
Do you see how there's kind of an extra bounciness in there?

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Where, you know, if a person was really sort of hopping along like

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,100
this, they wouldn't go down up down, and up again for the jump if they

89
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,300
knew they were landing.

90
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,600
And then going into another jump, they just go down once and up one's,

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
right?

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,800
So we kind of are in this situation where we're getting something that

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,900
we don't want happening there.

94
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,300
And if you think about why it's happening, it's because we just have a

95
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
single can die.

96
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
Idea of what it means to jump, right?

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
We have an animation.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
That's what it means to jump, and it involves going down coming back

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,000
up again.

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,800
Jumping Landing going down, and coming back up again.

101
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,800
That's what we coded for our jump Loop and this would be basically the

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,300
same.

103
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
You can kind of think of this.

104
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,000
As being very analogous to, if we had had an artist, create some kind

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,200
of an animation in a tool, like Sprite or something like that, and

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,300
they just made, you know, a jump animation.

107
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,600
Well, this is what we would get and we immediately run into this

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,300
problem.

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,800
There's this contextualization of what's Happening.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
The Landing that we want to use to create a more believable animation.

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,300
And so, what we're going to do instead of keeping that sort of canned

112
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,500
aspect to it, is what I want to show you show.

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,400
You today is how we can take something that was previously kind of

114
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
under a can animation control, and move just that one part out to

115
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,400
physical control or pseudo physical control.

116
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,000
In this case, where we're going to simulate that a little bit more, in

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,800
order to get a more continuous, more natural feel

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
He'll than if we're just trying to play Candy animations.

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,700
And obviously there are some solutions with candida Nations to a

120
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,400
limited extent.

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,300
We could make a candy intimation that we detect when we're doing the

122
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,000
double jump.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,400
You know when we're jumping off of a land and play that, you know,

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,900
half of it and you just keep multiplying out all your cases and maybe

125
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,600
that's fine.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,500
But in general if you can use some judicious simulation-based stuff,

127
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,300
it'll save you a lot of time and a lot of Animation budget, you know,

128
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,000
in the long run.

129
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,800
So I just want to show you that option here.

130
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:09,300
Okay, so if we go back and we look at where we were at, in our, our

131
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,300
hero head away, time in the rolling, I'm not in the right file there

132
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,600
for our hero body.

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,000
What we're doing is we're sort of taking this little movement mode

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,600
hopping thing and we're saying that when we're in movement mode

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
hopping, you know, here's the, here's the sort of deal with that,

136
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,300
right?

137
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
And it's broken to these sort of three phases.

138
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,800
There's the take-off phase where we kind of go down and up.

139
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,200
There's the landing phase where I'm sorry, there's the ballistic phase

140
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,000
where we're flying through the air and we this overlaps that phase.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we kind of have a little bit going on there and then there's the

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
landing phase where we come back down.

143
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
That's where we do that secondary compression.

144
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,200
So, what I want to do here is I want to kind of shift away from this

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,000
and move that that springiness, that sort of, you know, that that

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,500
torso springiness that we manually coded in T-Bob to be a sine wave.

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What I'm going to do is I'm going to say, let's pull that out to

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,600
something that's just always simulated.

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,600
So, the, the connection between the dudes,

150
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,300
The body, you know.

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,800
And you know the cape and the and the Torso is going to be just kind

152
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,500
of a spring.

153
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,200
And so when he wants to launch up into the air, you know, it'll push

154
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,800
upwards.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,799
And when he comes down and lands, it'll, you know, push downwards and

156
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,600
that sort of stuff.

157
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,299
And we'll just let it kind of dampen itself out in that sense, right?

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So let's go ahead and and make that happen.

159
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,799
So how are we going to do that?

160
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,600
Well, the first thing I'm going to do is decouple the usage of TB.

161
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,200
From any particular mode.

162
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,100
So I'm just going to move T Bob's, computations in their entirety.

163
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,400
I'm going to move those out into a separate thing that is not

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
dependent on the Move mode because we're just always going to

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Emulate that as this separate variable.

166
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,200
Now, if we want to override it in a mode, we certainly always could,

167
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,900
but at the Baseline, I want to just say it's simulated.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,400
So now all of the places that were previously Computing T-Bob are now

169
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,700
gone, as you can kind of see.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,700
And so now, we just have this thing here, which is like sine T Tower.

171
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,200
Whatever, right?

172
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
And here's the T-Bob.

173
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:28,000
So what I need to do now is I need to assign a Target value to the

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,600
T-Bob.

175
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,400
Okay.

176
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,900
In

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Other words I I need some knowledge of what the T-Bob should be at any

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,600
given point in time, right?

179
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,900
And so I'm going to I need a bunch of information about that and so

180
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,000
what I'm going to do is I'm going to create sort of a way of

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,900
prescribing, what I want the T-Bob to be, and just so you can kind of

182
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,700
understand where I'm going with this.

183
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,000
Where, as my Mischief, there it is.

184
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Huron day.

185
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
274.

186
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:12,100
So, what's happening here is I have you know the the bottom of the

187
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,200
hero and I've got the cape and I've got some notion that they are

188
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
connected by a sort of a piece that can move up and down for now

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,500
that's what we're saying, all right.

190
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,100
And there's two things that I want to do with this one is I want to

191
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:34,600
track its momentum so I want to be able to say Well if you know I am

192
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,500
coming down

193
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,000
Just part of the you know, ballistic phase or whatever when I get to

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,700
here you know, or at any point, during this thing there's a certain

195
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,100
amount of velocity to that middle piece, right?

196
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,100
And the reason that I need to be able to track that momentum or that

197
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,100
velocity really we you know it's technically momentum but since we're

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,700
not really working with masses here and we don't super care about

199
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,800
relative masses.

200
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
It's really not much of a momentum.

201
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,000
It's really just a velocity.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's you know, a momentum

203
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,300
has to do with mass and we're not really talking about that.

204
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
So we're just going to track, you know, we want to be able to say well

205
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,000
it's got a certain velocity and the reason we want to do that is

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,700
because for example, on the landing, when this thing lands, we want

207
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,600
the top piece to continue having that velocity even after the bottom

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,300
piece stops.

209
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
So we want some notion of that retained velocity.

210
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,700
But the other thing that we want is we want like a Target, you know?

211
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,000
D.

212
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,000
Or, you know, a Target position.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,400
And the reason that we want that is because we need to move this,

214
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,600
dude, we still need to do the things we were doing before we move him

215
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,900
down, you know, to a Crouch and then we move him up to Spring, right?

216
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,600
That's none of that.

217
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,700
Has anything to do with momentum, that's internally generated.

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,000
By the jumping action of the character.

219
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,100
And so there is no momentum to preserve or anything.

220
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,600
There we just, we straight up have to like prescribed that as part of

221
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
our animation.

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,100
And so, what we want to do is we want to take the places where we were

223
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,400
previously setting T-Bob do something specifically with that sine

224
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,900
function.

225
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,400
And now instead, we want to replace it with a suggestion of what the

226
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,800
velocity should be or what the position should be one of the other so

227
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,800
that we can, you know, wherever it was or whatever effects were on it

228
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,400
before, we can go ahead and preserve those and use, you know, the

229
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
motion in one continuous way.

230
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
And so this is a pretty

231
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
You standard technique, right?

232
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,000
It's basically just taking what was a prescribed position and turning

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,600
it into something.

234
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,700
That's a prescribed velocity or prescribed acceleration depending on

235
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,000
the circumstance is so that it can be mixed over time with other

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
things, in a natural physical way.

237
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,700
So that's all we're going to do that.

238
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
That's that's our goal.

239
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,500
Of course, it's easier said than done.

240
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,400
But I mean, at the high level, it's not particularly complicated thing

241
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,100
for us to do.

242
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,600
All right, so let's start with something very, very straightforward.

243
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's start by using some kind of a, let's, let's start by using some

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,900
kind of, a, sort of a spree system here to simulate this T-Bob, felt

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,100
this T-Bob value.

246
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,600
And what I'm probably going to do just to make it a little easier on

247
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
ourselves to hoops and region.

248
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm going to go to here and I'm going to have a DT

249
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,600
So I'm going to have its first derivative as well in here.

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,700
So, this is velocity and that's the position of that T-Bob.

251
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,600
Okay?

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,400
So what I want to do here is I want to say, well, alright, we want to

253
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,600
be able to correct the T-Bob, right?

254
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,000
We want to be able to do stuff for the people, and of course, I guess.

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I also have to stop setting it to 0.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,700
That's obviously not going to be good.

257
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
So when I come down through the movement mode, what I'm going to do at

258
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,600
the end of my movement mode code and I'm ready to sort of finalize,

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
the character here is I'm going to go ahead and simulate T-Bob the way

260
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,400
that we've been simulating everything else, right?

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,900
I'm going to go ahead and do a sort of standard equation of motion.

262
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:30,200
Just like we've done many times before something that looks like this.

263
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,300
Right.

264
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,300
I'm going to take the acceleration and I'm gonna that I want to to

265
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,700
this thing to have and I'm going to multiply it by the time step

266
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,900
squared, and I'm going to take the velocity multiplied by the time so

267
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,000
standard equation of motion.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,700
If you don't remember what these are, go back and look at the time, we

269
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,900
covered equations of motion.

270
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,500
And you'll notice I'm using these equations of motion because they're

271
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,600
the same equate, they're going to be the same equations of motions

272
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,700
fundamentally if we want physical, sort of behavior, we are going to

273
00:14:59,700 --> 00:14:59,800
start.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,100
Equations, even though we're talking about a value, which is not

275
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,600
really a position in space.

276
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,100
It's sort of this made-up value that we created, but because I want

277
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,300
the underlying parts of it to feel kind of physical, I'm using the

278
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,800
equations of motion as the basis for creating the thing that I'm going

279
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,400
to tune, if that makes sense.

280
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,700
And so I'm just going to start out by doing a very, very simple thing

281
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,100
here, which is like I said, just doing an accumulation for the

282
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
velocity and accumulation for the

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,900
Position and so we can set an acceleration for the bobbing now.

284
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,700
I don't actually know if I'm going to want to use acceleration per se.

285
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,600
I may end up wanting to just prescribe velocity directly, I don't

286
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,000
know.

287
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,000
But I'm going to start with the base physicality of it and see how

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,700
that goes.

289
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,900
So in this case, obviously we know the velocity the velocity is just

290
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,200
this.

291
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,800
I don't know why I said V3 there.

292
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,600
Our time step I think is actually technically is DP, right?

293
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,300
Not t.

294
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
So, you know, DT is the time step that's our velocity in our

295
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,300
acceleration.

296
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,000
Is the thing that we don't actually know at this point right now, if I

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,100
was to set our acceleration to 0, then what I would expect to see

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,000
happen here, right?

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,700
Is I would expect to see there, be no movement of that joint at all.

300
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,300
And that is exactly what I do.

301
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:24,700
See.

302
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,500
So, you know, if I come in

303
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,600
And I drop this down again so we can kind of see what's happening.

304
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,900
We're seeing that that joint is not is not doing anything, right.

305
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,800
Nothing's happening to the Joint whatsoever.

306
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,300
And, you know, we could probably do here as well, is if we wanted to,

307
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,900
we could go ahead.

308
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,800
And I don't even remember how we do this, exactly.

309
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
But I'm going to try here.

310
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,400
If I want to do sort of

311
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,600
This this sort of thing.

312
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm going to set up a Live code loop.

313
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,700
So here, what I've done is I just recorded the motion of the hero,

314
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,300
right?

315
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
And here he is, kind of moving back and forth.

316
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Now, I'm going to make four coder be a little bit smaller window just

317
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,400
slightly so that we can edit the code here while we watch the

318
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,599
animation in progress.

319
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,000
And this is what Loop live coding is really good for obviously,

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,200
because now we don't have to like, wonder what each individual code

321
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
changes doing.

322
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,300
We

323
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,600
It go and we just edit the animation in place, right?

324
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:31,800
Okay.

325
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,200
So obviously, you know, one thing I could do is I could make this

326
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
explode real quick if I wanted to, by just saying, like, let's give it

327
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,100
some acceleration and what should happen there is the thing should

328
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,800
just kind of like explode off into into space.

329
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,800
Oh, you know what?

330
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,700
I just realized, too.

331
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,900
These are static so they're going to get reset every time.

332
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,800
Hmm, I don't know that that's necessarily a problem.

333
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Because I can edit them but I wonder if we want to put those somewhere

334
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
else, you know what I mean?

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,100
Well, I'm not going to worry about it now but good to know that that's

336
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,000
a bug or at least thing.

337
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,800
I probably don't want if that makes sense.

338
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,900
All right, go back to world.

339
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,300
No, dear.

340
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,400
There we go.

341
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,800
Yeah, much nicer.

342
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,000
All right.

343
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,800
So assuming that that's maybe made a little bit more explicit because

344
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,900
that's a little bit subtle.

345
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Still, let me Crank That acceleration up quite a bit so if I crank

346
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,300
that acceleration up you can kind of see what's happening there right?

347
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,100
It just keeps going up and up and up and up and up right and

348
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,000
presumably it should go up faster as time goes by.

349
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,000
So if I was to make it the say 1.0 I would think it should be moving

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
fairly fast by the

351
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,200
Right.

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
Let me make it even faster.

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,800
okay, so now, we essentially have a separate, we have a separate

354
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,700
amount of acceleration on there that, where, you know, that were

355
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,800
applying and

356
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,100
Yeah.

357
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,400
And and so now you know, just thinking about that acceleration.

358
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
I can now sort of start to talk about what I might want to do with the

359
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,100
acceleration inside my, my other things here.

360
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
So I'm going to give this a better name.

361
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm going to call this DDT Bob so that it's not a, it's a second

362
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,800
derivative of Bob.

363
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,300
And I'm also going to go ahead and place this in here.

364
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,700
For now.

365
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,000
Okay, so if I'm going to set this DDT Bob, I'm going to go over here

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and place.

367
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
You know, this value of the top, I'm going to assume that there's no

368
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,500
acceleration and all I'm going to start doing now is just playing with

369
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
that that DDT in some of these routines to sort of set.

370
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,900
What I expect it to actually be in any given situation, right?

371
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm gonna get rid of the T value in here because I don't really need

372
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,600
it.

373
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
So what I'm going to do instead is I'm going to say well okay if the

374
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
entity key movement

375
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,000
Less than T jump.

376
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,200
And I don't care about this mid value anymore, so I really need

377
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,600
another one, which is like, I need sort of the, I guess if it's if

378
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
it's less than T, jump than what I want.

379
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,900
Is I want the DDT Bob.

380
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,000
I want it to be pointing upwards, so I'm to push up during that jump,

381
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:35,300
right?

382
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,100
I want to, I want to kind of push upward and what I want to do, for

383
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,100
the pushing upward is I want to say like, okay, you know, maybe that's

384
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,800
what we had before, which is like 100 or maybe it's even more than

385
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,900
that, maybe it's like 25 or something like that.

386
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,400
and and then when I you know in the middle of the the sort of Jump

387
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,800
Then I dont need any acceleration at all and when I am done and I'm

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
No, sort of Landing the thing.

389
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,500
Then again, don't really need any acceleration at all on that either.

390
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,900
However, what I want to do here is potentially alter the velocity on

391
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,400
the landing because when I land, I'm going to stop the the movement of

392
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:18,800
the guy.

393
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,600
So what I want to do is set his the velocity of his bobbing motion

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,400
directly.

395
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,900
Oops, to something that's going to be fairly - and I don't know again,

396
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,600
what that value should be, but we'll find out let's say something like

397
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,000
this.

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,800
All right.

399
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,900
So I'm going to go ahead and

400
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,300
And restart that guy here.

401
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,100
Also you know what I think I should probably do is well what I

402
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,500
probably should have done is done us.

403
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,100
A loop that doesn't go for so long at first because we have to clean

404
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,400
up the rest of our stuff before this is going to make any sense.

405
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,800
Well alright I'll just code the rest of it.

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,300
Okay so we're going to want to play with those values to get those

407
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:03,900
into some right.

408
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,100
Ranges and all that.

409
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,100
But what I need to do first obviously if we want to look at this in

410
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,700
More detail as as multiple hops happen is I now need some notion that

411
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,000
there's going to be like a restoration to the normal location to the

412
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,700
back towards zero, right?

413
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
So I need something that constantly pulls this back towards zero,

414
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,000
especially in the case, where the DDT, you know, if you're if he's not

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,100
being activated at all.

416
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,800
But so what I want to do is I want to go ahead and say hey let's put a

417
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,100
thing on that looks at how far away I am from 0 and up.

418
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,000
Why is an acceleration in the opposite direction of that, right?

419
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,900
So what I want to do is I want to say instead of initializing my DDT,

420
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,200
Bob well, I guess I still want to lose 50 when I accumulated here

421
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,900
before I actually go and use it for anything.

422
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,300
I want to take my DDT Bob and I want to add to it essentially an

423
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,500
acceleration back towards zero.

424
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,500
So I know where I am.

425
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Right.

426
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
I know, I'm here.

427
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,600
So what I want to do is just add some negative amount.

428
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't know how much, but I want to add

429
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,600
Um, - amount that will push back towards that 0, right?

430
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,100
That will restore me back there if that makes sense.

431
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,300
Okay, so

432
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
let's see here.

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,400
That doesn't seem strong enough.

434
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Unfortunately, we need something that's going to be strong.

435
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,000
There we go.

436
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,700
So you can kind of see it starting to work, right?

437
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
You can kind of see it.

438
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
It's trying its fighting to restore it.

439
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,000
But this, this negative velocity that gets put on there as a little

440
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
bit too much for it.

441
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,700
Maybe tune that down a little bit, right?

442
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,600
So hopefully you can sort of already see the starting to work a little

443
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,200
bit, right?

444
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,800
It's starting to be almost

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,600
Most a workable sort of jump, feel right?

446
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,500
You see how that's starting to look pretty good?

447
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,900
And so now what we really have to start taking into account, mmm.

448
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,100
Is what happens during The Landing part of things where I'm actually

449
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,000
on the ground.

450
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Because as the head moves towards the side, I want to be starting that

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,300
jump.

452
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,200
So I want to be pushing down based on the distance that the head is

453
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,300
from the body.

454
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,300
And I already know that, right?

455
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,400
I've got this body distance here and I know the take-off distance,

456
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,000
right?

457
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:45,800
Excuse me.

458
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,300
Well, I guess I don't actually go to take off distance now that I

459
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,100
think about it.

460
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,800
So, yeah, we're gonna have to tune that as well.

461
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,400
This is actually based on something slightly different, but what I

462
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,500
want to do is as that head moves to the side.

463
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
I want the, the natural Crouch to happen so that he's ready to spring

464
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,300
out as necessary, right?

465
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,100
So, what I'm going to do here is say, okay, you know, I need to know

466
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,400
how far the head is from the body, and I feel like that where we ever

467
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,300
Computing that

468
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,600
it's like, I guess we weren't

469
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,400
No, we were Computing, some other things based on the head but not

470
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,900
that one.

471
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,700
So what I want to do here when we're planted, I want to do and I'll

472
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,600
probably just put this up here for always.

473
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,200
So I'm going to say that, there's a the head distance, right?

474
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,300
And the head distance is just the length of the vector from me, right?

475
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,500
From the from the body.

476
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,600
I want to go from the body to wherever the head is.

477
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,100
Right.

478
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,600
So however far that is that's that head distance.

479
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,200
And then we're going to say like Max Head distance for this purpose is

480
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,800
going to be some value that we will tune, which is how far we want the

481
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,500
head to be, you know, it's probably less than that.

482
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,600
But it's how far away we want the head to be.

483
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,200
What or how far the head will be when working, you know, maximally

484
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,800
when we're pushing down as hard as we're going to push down, okay?

485
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,100
So max the head distance on the Mac said distance tells us that and

486
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,700
what we can do here again is we can do a like a head, a t head

487
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,300
distance.

488
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:31,800
Now which again uses that map that sort of map command that we've got.

489
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
Where is it map?

490
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,800
I've got it here somewhere.

491
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Clamp, 01 mapped arranged.

492
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
That's the one I wanted lamps are one mapped arranged.

493
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,500
And what I want to do here is say, I want to map from 0 to the max

494
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,400
head distance, whatever the actual head distance is right now and that

495
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,100
produces a number between zero and one that I can now use to multiply

496
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,000
however, much crouching, I want to have happen.

497
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,800
So instead of this being, the only thing that happens just

498
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
An upward Force.

499
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,500
Now, whenever the head is moving away from the body and we're in a

500
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,100
planted mode, what we're going to want to do there is we're going to

501
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,500
want to apply that crouching effect as well.

502
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,600
So that's anytime, right?

503
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,900
That's any time, we're in this mode, we essentially want to, you know,

504
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,700
maybe do - 50 or something.

505
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,700
We're going to take whatever.

506
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,400
RT.

507
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,000
Head distance is so, however, far the head is moved and that's how how

508
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,800
hard we're going to be pushing down if that makes sense.

509
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,000
So that's what will give us that sort of that sort of ducking effect.

510
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,400
Alright, so now we have to actually get this part working and it

511
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,500
doesn't quite look to me.

512
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,600
Like it is because as that head was moving, you can see the head

513
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,200
moving away.

514
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
I didn't actually see the DDT.

515
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,300
Bob actually have any effect there so when we were in movement planted

516
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,300
it seemed it did not seem to be actually applying any anything useful

517
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500
to DDT, Bob.

518
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,700
And I'm not sure why.

519
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,300
So, let's take a look at what's going on there.

520
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,800
We compute the head distance.

521
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And that looks like a fairly reasonable thing.

522
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,200
We have the max head distance, we don't really know if that value is,

523
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,700
is useful.

524
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,400
You know what I can do is I can quickly check just like commenting

525
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,700
this out, I can check to see whether it's largely just because of

526
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,300
that.

527
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,900
So it looks like that's not getting applied at all.

528
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,400
So it has nothing to do with the head distance computation, it's just

529
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,100
that DDT.

530
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,600
Bob just isn't actually getting applied in a particular way, it would

531
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,200
seem because if we were in movement planted, we should have been

532
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
getting this, this thing happening here, right?

533
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,800
And we should

534
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,500
Should have seen been seeing that come down.

535
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,600
Oh, I see why I've got a compile error.

536
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
What's the compile error?

537
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,400
No operator found.

538
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,500
Which takes a left hand of V 3.

539
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,900
What?

540
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,400
Oh whoops I just was missing a little arrow.

541
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,200
Okay, let's try that again.

542
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,200
All right, so that's obviously a little too strong to say, the very

543
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,600
least, so I'm going to back off on that a little bit, right?

544
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,600
And let's see.

545
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,900
All right, so that's looking pretty good to me.

546
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,000
That's starting to look quite nice and so,

547
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,900
I guess the only thing I would probably say here is I probably want to

548
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,400
tune this part to be a little bit, a little bit more.

549
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,800
A little bit closer.

550
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,700
To the edge.

551
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,500
I probably don't want as much time.

552
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,400
Like, the Hop should have happened, probably pretty quickly.

553
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,900
So there should be less of the other parts of this.

554
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,000
I should think and actually teal and probably would happen and we

555
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,700
don't need any this stuff.

556
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Doesn't really need to be there at all anymore.

557
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Teal and can just be we can just set this when we actually finish the

558
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,100
movement, right?

559
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,600
And so now like this part, for the most for the most part is just

560
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,700
something that we can sort of say is is

561
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,900
I'm things and we don't really have to worry about this at all.

562
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,400
I don't know if the entity DP ever really wants to be something, but

563
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,200
we can put that up here as a thing to look at later.

564
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,100
But again, I'm just going to kind of hack this apart and say, well,

565
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,000
alright, so here we go with that.

566
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,200
We that all looks pretty good now.

567
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,200
Oops,

568
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,800
Okay, so now let's try and let's try and make this be a little bit

569
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,500
more.

570
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,100
Let's see.

571
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,800
Yeah, we got it.

572
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,100
We got to just work on the tuning here.

573
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,600
So I want this key jump like there to be like, basically a tea thrust,

574
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,100
right?

575
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,800
And I want that to go for longer.

576
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,700
So I wanted to take off sort of before he finishes his upward push.

577
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,600
So he kind of pushes through it a little

578
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,200
And we'll see how that goes.

579
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,800
And that definitely goes up a little too high there, but I'm not sure

580
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,300
exactly how I want to tune around it.

581
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,500
So I'm going to take a look at the TT.

582
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,700
Bob here is negative 20 and I guess the DDT Bob here,

583
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,700
Should really be well, it should be nothing.

584
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,500
But that's what it would have been anyway.

585
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,000
I feel like that's a little bit of a non sequitur happening in the

586
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,600
animation there.

587
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,900
But I'm not really sure exactly where it's coming from.

588
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,100
If that makes sense.

589
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm going to go switch off the loop live coding for a second and just

590
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,200
move the the fellow around myself.

591
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,000
All right.

592
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Okay, so there we can kind of see what's happening a little bit

593
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,000
better.

594
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,300
Okay.

595
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,300
Oh right.

596
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,000
This is something I wanted to cover perfect.

597
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,400
So if we take a look at what's happening right now, you can see that.

598
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,600
It's just oscillating back and forth.

599
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,600
So this would be a perfect time to talk about this at.

600
00:32:59,600 --> 00:32:59,900
Don't

601
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
I've talked about it before and I wanted to talk about it.

602
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
So I'm going to talk about it now.

603
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,800
So we are trying to do is essentially a spring here, right?

604
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm trying to make it feel like a kind of bouncy sort of Wiggly thing.

605
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,800
And so when I did write is I said, okay I've got this.

606
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,000
This concept of you know here's the zero point right here is mighty

607
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,800
Bob, this is at zero and you know it's going to go positive this way

608
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
your - that way.

609
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,800
And so if I'm

610
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,900
You know, up here or down here, and I want to apply an acceleration,

611
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,100
that will try to get me back to where I'm going.

612
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,100
Well, obviously, if T-Bob is positive, I want to apply something - and

613
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,200
if T-Bob is - I want to play Something Positive.

614
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,000
So I just basically said okay you know the acceleration that I want to

615
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,500
apply here is going to be equal to something, right?

616
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,300
Some mystery coefficient whatever I want to tune because it's whatever

617
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,400
I want right times.

618
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,800
Whatever the the T-Bob value was,

619
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
And I want to always make that - so that I'm going against wherever

620
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,400
T-Bob is.

621
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,500
So that's pushing it back towards zero, right?

622
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,000
And this is what's essentially an called an undamped spring.

623
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,300
And I can show you the more formal version of it.

624
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:18,900
What the more formal version of it actually is is it says that the

625
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,600
acceleration right?

626
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Whatever that acceleration?

627
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,199
In this case, acceleration is probably the wrong term because usually

628
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,300
Springs are in for space again.

629
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Like I said we're not caring about Mass here.

630
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,500
Remember Force equals mass times acceleration.

631
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,400
So when you don't care about mass then Force equals acceleration

632
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
effectively and you're talking about the same thing.

633
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,500
But in a more physically stimulated system where we had differences of

634
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,000
masses that we cared about

635
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,800
Kind of important to talk about ones which ones which we are actually

636
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,400
sort of talking about force and we talk about Springs.

637
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
But in our case we're putting Springs directly on acceleration because

638
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
we just don't care about the mass part.

639
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,400
But it's worth noting in case you're in a physics space that there is

640
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,900
that translation that would happen there.

641
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,500
So anyway, we're trying to compute the force and the force of the

642
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,200
spring.

643
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,800
That we're going to apply what we typically talk about saying is Well

644
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,900
there's a coefficient of for the positional part of it, right?

645
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,100
So the coefficient for the positional part and the coefficient for the

646
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,800
positional part is X where we want to go, right?

647
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,000
So it's our, it's our Target position - our current position, right?

648
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
And so it's exactly what I drew up here.

649
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Just I had baked out kind of a lot of different things in my head just

650
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,900
because I knew what they were, but you can think of this

651
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,300
Is actually saying, well, I wanted T-Bob, right?

652
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,800
So, my position Target I wanted T-Bob to be 0, right?

653
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,300
I wanted to be right here at zero.

654
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,800
So, my target value is 0, where was I?

655
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,200
Well, I'm at T-Bob, right?

656
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm at whatever that value is.

657
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:56,500
So obviously, this term of my equation PT minus PC, I just computed in

658
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,000
my head, right?

659
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,900
The simple trivial thing, this is 0, this is

660
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
T-Bob so it's negative T-Bob, right?

661
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,600
That's why I type that in.

662
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,700
But this is the more formal way of saying it.

663
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,100
The target - the current location.

664
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,600
And then this right here, this CP, that's the tuning value, that's the

665
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
value you plug in to say, how stiff, how powerful do you want this

666
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,900
thing to push back towards its Target is right?

667
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,600
But this is an undamped spring and the reason it's an undamped spring

668
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,100
is because look at what it does, it will never actually Hit the Target

669
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,800
and the reason for that is because it behaves exactly like a pendulum

670
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,500
does when it's far away, it pushes very hard to get back towards where

671
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,900
it's trying to get to, but by the time it gets back there, it has

672
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:42,500
built up so much velocity that it shoots straight through, right?

673
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
It has no damping.

674
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,000
And so, what we want to do is we want to also apply a force, a damping

675
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,200
Force out here in another term that will make our velocity be what we

676
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,500
wanted it to be as well.

677
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,300
And in this case, I want the velocity is 0.

678
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,000
I wanted to become to.

679
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,900
I want to come to rest at that.

680
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,800
Right?

681
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,700
So what I'm going to do is add another term here, right?

682
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,400
Which is the coefficient for the velocity and that's going to be

683
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,100
whatever the velocity Target is - whatever the velocity current is

684
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,900
right.

685
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,200
And I know it, my current velocity is and I know what my target is.

686
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,400
My target is 0 and this right here is DT.

687
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,900
Bob.

688
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,000
Okay, so again just like before since it's zero, really what I can say

689
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,700
is it's just - DT Bob is the value I'm looking for and then I can tune

690
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,900
a parameter that helps me.

691
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
Get my damping in there.

692
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,600
Okay, so you see it oscillating.

693
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,100
We need to stop that oscillation.

694
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,600
So let's add in that term and you can kind of see right here.

695
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,700
This is my spring equation.

696
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,600
This right here, is that coefficient I was talking about.

697
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,900
And so, if I wanted to make this look more like the actual math that

698
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,800
we talked about, right?

699
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,900
It looks like this.

700
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,100
So there's my Bob Target - Mighty Bob and there's the, the spring

701
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,700
Force.

702
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,400
If I can put it right here, this is our coefficient for the position

703
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,100
of the spring.

704
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,400
There you go.

705
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,700
And now you know I can pilot it's going to exactly

706
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Same like a change until I add in that condition for the velocity.

707
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,100
I don't know what that's going to be, but we'll find out in the

708
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,700
second.

709
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,800
So I'm going to add my CV again.

710
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,200
I want nothing.

711
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,500
I want to come to rest, so I'm going to, I want to come to rest and I

712
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,200
want to take that entity.

713
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,800
DT Bob, which is the velocity because that's what the current value

714
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,000
is.

715
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,500
So they're now I'm going to compile that out and you can see now that

716
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,100
damping for it.

717
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,500
That's exactly what we wanted and you can understand intuitively, why

718
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,600
this works is very kind of interesting.

719
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
Very simple equation was very interesting how it works.

720
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,300
So this term, right is the thing that's building up all that velocity

721
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,700
to correct our displacement.

722
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,200
So we have a displacement that's out.

723
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,700
Here, we have a Target, we're trying to get to, let me draw that the

724
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,400
way I drew it before us.

725
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,300
It's not reversed.

726
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,000
So here's where we are right.

727
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,600
Here is

728
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,200
rpe current here is our P Target and we've got this big displacement.

729
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,300
So this term becomes very large when we're out very far away and we

730
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,600
push we get a lot of acceleration to move inward, right?

731
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,900
But as we move closer to our Target, this term becomes much

732
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Smaller.

733
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,000
In fact, eventually, when we hit the target, it will be 0.

734
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,700
So, as we move closer, right?

735
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,000
If you imagine over time here, here's our time and here is that

736
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,500
acceleration from the positional term.

737
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,200
Right.

738
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,000
It's very high you know right here when we're here it's very high and

739
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,700
then as we get closer and closer, right?

740
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,100
It's coming down that term just keeps going down and down, and down,

741
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,500
and down.

742
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,400
And this is, this is really it's linear, so it looks like that.

743
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,500
So that's what's happening here.

744
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Our velocity on the other hand is doing exactly the opposite thing.

745
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,400
If we're just sitting out here doing nothing, sorry out here, doing

746
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
nothing, our velocity is 0.

747
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,800
This term is nothing, but as we pick up that speed as we correct,

748
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,500
we're getting it fast.

749
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,300
And faster and faster until somewhere in the middle this term, right?

750
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,200
Is going like this this term becomes the dominant term and start to

751
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,600
correct that philosophy.

752
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,600
So there's less of the acceleration is now pushing us towards our

753
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,900
Target and more is pushing against that sort of income and velocity.

754
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So we speed up and then slow down to hit our Target, right?

755
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,300
And so there's two types of Springs under damped

756
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,000
and overdamped.

757
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
And really technically, there's a Third Kind, which is called

758
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,500
critically damped

759
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,300
So when under damp spring is the one we had before, it doesn't have

760
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,500
either.

761
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,300
It had have any damping in that case or it doesn't have sufficient

762
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,700
damping.

763
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,500
Now I actually want an under damped spring, that's what I'm looking

764
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:30,900
for.

765
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,200
I want a little bit of that wobble, right?

766
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,600
Because that's animation, that's that and right.

767
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,600
But that's not necessarily what you want for every circumstance.

768
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,400
So it's good to know that there's different kinds.

769
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
So under damped is what we're going for.

770
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,800
That's what we want.

771
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,700
So I'm happy with her at but there are other kinds like I said over

772
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,600
damp spring is a one that slows.

773
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,800
I'm too much.

774
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,300
So it will always hit its Target.

775
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:53,900
Exactly 0.

776
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,800
But it will take a long time to get there because there's so it's like

777
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,500
a really strong headwind as the position try is.

778
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,700
You know, it's pushing down as hard as it can.

779
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,800
The that counter velocity Force gets strong really quickly because

780
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,100
it's got a really stiff term.

781
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,500
And so it just kind of slowly gets there.

782
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,300
And then comes to stop and critically damped is right at the, at the

783
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,200
midpoint critically, damped is the one where it will go as fast as it

784
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,100
possibly could have gone to its Target while still stopping exactly on

785
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,500
the Target, right?

786
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,800
So it's perfectly damp.

787
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,400
It like, literally damp snow more than it absolutely had to to

788
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,700
correct, right.

789
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,200
So, those are the different types of spring equations.

790
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,900
You could end up with and they are just statements about these two

791
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,200
variables, right?

792
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,500
And, a critically damped spring is when these two are perfectly

793
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,300
matched.

794
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,400
An under damped spring is, when this value is low compared to this

795
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,000
one, not the magnitude of them, totally, but rather just their effect,

796
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,700
right?

797
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,100
Because again, these are in different spaces.

798
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,400
This is velocity, space, efficient space.

799
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,500
So these aren't going to be equal if they're equal right there.

800
00:41:59,500 --> 00:41:59,800
Going to be.

801
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,300
But point being, it's what their relationship is in the broader scheme

802
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:03,700
of things.

803
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,500
So if you want a more under damped spring, you're going to reduce this

804
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,000
value.

805
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,300
If you want a more overdamped spring, you're going to drive this value

806
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,400
higher, right?

807
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,800
And if you want to critically damped bring you a trip to solve for it.

808
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,400
It's actually a thing.

809
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,700
You have to do to figure out what those two values should be.

810
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,600
Because it's an exact perfect alignment.

811
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,400
You can't just tweak the values and expect to get there.

812
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,300
I mean, eventually, if you did it long enough, you get to roughly the

813
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,800
correct answer.

814
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,900
But there actually is a correct solve for it that you

815
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,400
I'd do if you really want to but point being now we're getting now,

816
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,300
we're getting somewhere, right?

817
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,300
And I'm going to go ahead and crank up my my time step value back to

818
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,000
the actual time step because I want to see.

819
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,800
Now, roughly where we're at.

820
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,000
I want to see what our what our status is.

821
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
That makes sense, right.

822
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,600
And I think I do feel like this is the heads moving a little faster

823
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,100
than I think.

824
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,200
It normally would be, at least at the outset of the game.

825
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,800
You know, this it heads moving at this.

826
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,000
At a speed that I feel like is more indicative of maybe if you were in

827
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
a PowerUp scenario.

828
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,600
So I think I do want to just briefly go in for while we're kind of

829
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,100
working on this and tune that down.

830
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,900
Oops.

831
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,300
I want to go ahead and take that head motion and just make that head

832
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,100
motion a little bit sluggish by comparison.

833
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,600
So I'm not sure what it should be, but I'm going to play with it here.

834
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,000
So that's that's more.

835
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,400
I think that's more what I'm looking for.

836
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:32,900
Okay.

837
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,200
And so then similarly I think I'm also going to slow down the jump a

838
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,500
little bit now that I've, you know, have a slightly sore head motion,

839
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,600
I'm going to go ahead and here and just slow down that that hop right

840
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,600
now we were using a multiplier on the time step of.

841
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
So it was a fifth of a second.

842
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,900
It took to do the Hop.

843
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,500
Now it's going to be more like a quarter of a second.

844
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:05,200
So, I'm not getting that downward motion that I wanted, right?

845
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,700
I want, I want that downward motion as I move the head.

846
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,400
And I think that's, because we were right in the middle that when I

847
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,700
said, what's wrong with my spring.

848
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,400
So we know that we've got to come back to Here.

849
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,900
And Now find out why this isn't happening, right?

850
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,100
Why am I not?

851
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,600
Why am I not getting any any of this application here?

852
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,500
And I don't know, maybe it's not strong enough.

853
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,900
Okay, so that's the problem.

854
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
So just wasn't strong enough I guess.

855
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,100
Okay.

856
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,600
Of course, when it's x t, head distance, Tia distance.

857
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,200
I'm not really sure why.

858
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,000
The T had distance isn't something that I can tune back to zero so I

859
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,700
should be able to tune that back towards lower than it is right.

860
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Let me go ahead and see if I can make this a little bit more forgiving

861
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,200
here.

862
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,500
There we go.

863
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:56,700
Okay.

864
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,800
I'm just leaving this exaggerated.

865
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,100
I can, well, I figure out how far away to make this go.

866
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,500
So, I feel like that's actually pretty close to correct.

867
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
So, I think that's okay.

868
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
So I'm going to go ahead here and tune this value back to something, a

869
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,100
little less ridiculous.

870
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
And so one thing that's a little bit odd.

871
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,600
Well, actually no, I don't know, I guess, it's probably.

872
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,000
Okay.

873
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,600
We're just kind of taking a minute to look at this and see but point

874
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,200
being at starting to feel much nicer to me, right?

875
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,300
This work is starting to pay off, I think, right?

876
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,000
Because now that hop is feeling really good, right?

877
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,400
It's starting to have a little bit of that kinetic Miss to it.

878
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,700
And honestly, the biggest problem now is, are, you know, is starting

879
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,300
to be more like me to start addressing stuff likewise in the head

880
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,600
connected, right.

881
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,300
But we're starting to get a much better.

882
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:08,900
Feel like a much better kinetic, feel kind of in there for that for

883
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,400
that T-Bob, right?

884
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,800
So that might still be a little much, so I'm going to back off just a

885
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,600
just a hair.

886
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,100
All right, so you can kind of feel how that's going.

887
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,200
Now, you can kind of, you can see roughly what I'm talking about,

888
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:38,800
right?

889
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,000
So yeah, yeah.

890
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,500
So now what I'd like to do as well, is I would like to be able to, I

891
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:54,800
want the head to snap to the body when you are not pushing it.

892
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,100
So, when I moving the head around, I want it to be doing what it's

893
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:58,800
doing here.

894
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,100
But when I Let Go, I want it to snap back to the correct location.

895
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,700
So I want to

896
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,900
Back to to neutral if that makes sense.

897
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:13,000
And so I want to apply exactly the same sort of what sort of looking

898
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,200
for.

899
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,000
I want to, I want to apply the same Technique.

900
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,100
We just used for the spring there to sort of suck that head back

901
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,300
towards where it should be and I guess I don't need to close.

902
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,000
I always forget that.

903
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,900
I don't have to close the game because we have the Live code editing.

904
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
But so what I want to do is kind of apply exactly that same theory

905
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,700
that I just showed you with the spring.

906
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,600
I want that too.

907
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,100
To apply to the head as well.

908
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,000
And so what I'm going to do here is say that the head we're going to

909
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,500
like sort of fuss with the heads movement there in some way.

910
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,200
Now I don't really know we sort of have the body point to the Head.

911
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,200
We don't have the head point back to the body at the moment, which

912
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,400
seems like probably an issue, although this makes sort of get to that

913
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,200
sort of.

914
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
This may get to the question that I was asking earlier about whether I

915
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,900
really even want these two to be do separate things or whether I just

916
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:06,700
want them to be one thing.

917
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,200
And I don't really know yet, which one of those is true, but I'm going

918
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
to keep them as separate things for a little bit because I feel like

919
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,900
sometimes, maybe you get spells that disembody your head and your

920
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,300
body, I mean, who knows, right?

921
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,700
Game design stuff.

922
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,800
You sometimes want to throw in ridiculous stuff at various times and

923
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,000
you don't want your whole game to be based on the fact that that's not

924
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
happening and then have to hack all around it.

925
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,700
So since they're sort of separately movable things

926
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,900
might as well leave them as two separate entities so that we can

927
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,200
dissociate them ad at a various times if we want to but what that

928
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,000
means if I want to kind of apply a backwards for us to the head here,

929
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,700
I'm going to want to be able to reach into that head and sort of do

930
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,600
operations now.

931
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,400
I think that sort of has some implications for the way we're doing our

932
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,400
energy stuff right now.

933
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
Like that maybe means we want to do a physics pass-first where we can

934
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
accumulate forced into people and then have them do stuff so that the

935
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,900
body can just reach into the head and do it.

936
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,300
I'm not sure.

937
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:03,500
But, you know, that's, that's sort of what I'm thinking here.

938
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,200
So, I'm going to look at just doing it just that way.

939
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,600
And the way that I'm going to do that is I'm just going to say, well,

940
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,300
we already have this concept of the body distance, right?

941
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,700
So all I really need.

942
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,300
If I want to do a spring, remember, we sort of had things easy.

943
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,400
When I did the previous spring because we didn't actually have to

944
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,000
compute anything we had T-Bob.

945
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,100
And we had DT Bob, which are the two things we needed, okay?

946
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And these were both scalar values and we already knew what they were.

947
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,100
So if we want to apply the same technique that sort of simple, very,

948
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,900
very simple, basic spring equation.

949
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,800
If we want to apply that basic technique,

950
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,700
All we need to do is figure out a way to produce the position and

951
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,000
velocity terms.

952
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,400
Those differences that we need.

953
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,500
And so you know again if you look at here we don't have to do any work

954
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:54,800
to get them.

955
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,500
But you know, if you look at what they actually are, it's very simple

956
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,800
PT, minus PC.

957
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,900
It's basically the length.

958
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,900
If we, if these weren't scalars, we just need the length.

959
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,500
You know how far apart they are.

960
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,200
So we can trivially turn a vector equation into a spring equation.

961
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Even though the spring equation is just a scalar equation.

962
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,100
We can trivially turn it into a vector equation by simply making these

963
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,700
lengths.

964
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,300
So previously, you know, if we're doing the force of the spring,

965
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,300
equals the coefficient on the positions times, some scalar Target,

966
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:24,600
right?

967
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,900
So, this is a position Target - the position current, and then we've

968
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,200
got the coefficient on the velocities.

969
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,700
And we've got the velocity Target - the velocity current.

970
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,100
If this is what we have, four scalar values.

971
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,800
While turning this into a vector equation is really simple.

972
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,500
All we really need to do is say the

973
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,500
the force that we're going to apply, we want to compute is just the

974
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,100
length of whatever these values are.

975
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,200
They can be any arbitrary Vector that we can take the length of their

976
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,300
difference, right?

977
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,300
And then we can do the same thing for the velocity vectors, right?

978
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,800
So now it's a vector equation.

979
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,500
And we have the force of the spring.

980
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,000
So the only question is well, okay, we have a scalar but we need a

981
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,600
vector acceleration, right?

982
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,900
We've got some Forest on a spring.

983
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,500
How do we produce a vector solution that?

984
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:16,100
Well, we know the spring is always going to act in the opposite

985
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,000
direction of whatever.

986
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,500
This is, you know, whatever this guys doing, right?

987
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:27,500
So if we want the spring to be still a scalar spring, we can just use

988
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,800
the distance between the two of them to a

989
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,600
Apply it.

990
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:35,000
And we can break this into two equations if we want to apply it in two

991
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
different directions, right.

992
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,000
That's thing.

993
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,900
One we can do thing to we can do is if we want this to be a

994
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,600
non-euclidean spring, right?

995
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,000
Are sorry.

996
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,600
If we wants to be a straight euclidean spring, that doesn't a

997
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,000
component wise spring.

998
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,000
We can do this on each of the of the elements individually as well,

999
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,200
right?

1000
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,500
We could do this for X4, y4 Z, but assuming that we want it to be

1001
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
based on the distance apart and not

1002
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
The individual, you know, Manhattan distance, effectively, we want to

1003
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,700
do it this way.

1004
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,800
So if we're going to do that, well the corrective Force that's trying

1005
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,100
to correct for position and the corrective Force.

1006
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,000
That's trying to correct for velocity.

1007
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,200
Those may not be wanting to act in the same direction, right?

1008
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:22,400
And the reason I say that is because if you imagine what's going on

1009
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,700
here, let's say that I have an object that's moving in this direction,

1010
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,400
okay?

1011
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,700
But I want it to be

1012
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,100
Going 0 speed, right?

1013
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,300
So I'm trying to make it speed 0 and it's supposed to be over here is

1014
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,000
the location, it's supposed to get to.

1015
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,300
So here's the P Target, right?

1016
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,200
It's over here.

1017
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,500
The velocity Target is going to be, you know, 000.

1018
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,100
well, it's actually write that that

1019
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:56,000
Try to, I try to use a better notation since this is in theory an

1020
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,100
educational stream.

1021
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,400
So, I've lost the target is 000.

1022
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,500
But my velocity right now, right.

1023
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,100
My current velocity is definitely not that it's got a pretty heavy x

1024
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:08,600
velocity.

1025
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,300
So, it's got, you know, 10 in there or something, right.

1026
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,600
But then when I look at what I have to do to correct the position.

1027
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,200
Well, the position is way down in y.

1028
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,300
So the force that I need to compute, when I compute these values for

1029
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,300
the forces, they want to apply in different directions.

1030
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,600
This is the

1031
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,900
So long, which I would want to apply the forest correct position.

1032
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,100
And this is the axis along which I would want to apply the forest to

1033
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,800
correct the velocity.

1034
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,700
So what I probably want to do, right, is break these into two, there's

1035
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,600
a force to correct the position and that equals the coefficient on the

1036
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,300
position X, again, the position Target - position current, and if I

1037
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,500
turn this into a vector equation, oops, I take that length.

1038
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,800
and this gives me a scalar, this

1039
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,900
Allure is just going to act along the direction, implied by this

1040
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,400
measure, right?

1041
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,000
So, I turn this into, okay?

1042
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,400
There is a Delta value, right?

1043
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,000
There's a Delta position and that Delta position is the position

1044
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,900
Target - position thing, right?

1045
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,500
This is the difference between them, right?

1046
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,100
It's this Vector right here.

1047
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,700
That Vector is the vector that I am both going to measure right.

1048
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,200
So I'm going to figure out what that Delta p is.

1049
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,400
And I'm going to use it to figure out how powerful the spring should

1050
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,800
be.

1051
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,100
But then it's also going to be how I apply the f p.

1052
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,900
So the spring force will actually be Delta peas direction, right times

1053
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,600
this this the CP value, right?

1054
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,700
If that makes sense.

1055
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,800
So how would we compute the direction of Delta P?

1056
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Well, if we wanted to compute the direction of Delta P, then we would

1057
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,500
take the vector, Delta p and we would divide it by its length, right?

1058
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,600
That's what we would be doing.

1059
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,000
Straightforward.

1060
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:08,600
Right?

1061
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,000
So what my equation would end up being is I want to take this Force.

1062
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,700
Here is my Force, right?

1063
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,400
And I want to apply this force in this direction.

1064
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,200
Make sense.

1065
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:24,600
But this term was already in the equation, right?

1066
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,100
So, if I expand this out, what I actually get is, Delta p over the

1067
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,300
length of P times c.

1068
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,800
P times Delta P.

1069
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,700
Well, Delta P.

1070
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,100
This is a linear equation.

1071
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,100
Delta p is the same value.

1072
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,300
So, if I'm dividing my it, then multiplying might as well get rid of

1073
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,600
it.

1074
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,700
Makes sense, right?

1075
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,000
So what you then end up with is like oh in order to apply this actual

1076
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
spring force, all I'm actually doing here is multiplying my CP by the

1077
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,700
difference.

1078
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,700
That's it.

1079
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,700
so this equation then becomes

1080
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,700
actions are right in the same way.

1081
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,200
See p times Delta P, right?

1082
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,700
And I don't even have to go through that whole length taking process.

1083
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,600
So all of this stuff, this whole scalar thing here that we're doing in

1084
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,400
scalar, we can actually do it directly in Vector without ever doing

1085
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,400
any lengths or even it's separating it into its component form or

1086
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
anything like that.

1087
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,300
It will just work.

1088
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,000
So that's pretty cool.

1089
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,900
The rest of its again, same thing.

1090
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,300
If I wanted to do the the forest for the vector part, I get the same

1091
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,300
thing here, right?

1092
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,100
Delta V and c v and so I can go ahead and rewrite my vector equation,

1093
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,600
the force that I'm going to apply for my spring is a CP times a Delta

1094
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,500
p and since these are two vectors I can add them together, right?

1095
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,200
And there is my Vector spring equation.

1096
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,000
All right.

1097
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,500
So, and I suppose I should underscore that punch line there.

1098
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,800
So, when we got back here, if you think about well doing it this way,

1099
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,400
and doing it this way component wise, they actually work out to be the

1100
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,700
same way, if that makes sense, meaning applying it per element because

1101
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:27,000
you are multiplying by the length eventually, anyway, ends up being

1102
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,400
the same operation, I don't, that makes any sense, but that's

1103
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,200
basically the idea

1104
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:38,100
so if I wanted to do this, to make a force that kind of restores the

1105
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,800
head, or pushes the head back towards, where it needs to go, what I

1106
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,200
could do is say, well, I know that the head

1107
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,600
At the moment, has a DP all this tab directly into it for now.

1108
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,500
And I'm going to add into it again, that sort of, DT times the

1109
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,800
acceleration to give I'm going to basically set the acceleration of

1110
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:58,800
that dude.

1111
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,700
And this is again kind of a hack because I really should be

1112
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,900
restructuring Energy System at some point here soon to make these

1113
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,300
sorts of things a little bit cleaner.

1114
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,900
So this is not really right, but I'm just going to do it for now to

1115
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,900
get this part working so that we can end the day in a reasonable

1116
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,600
amount of time.

1117
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,700
But head DP

1118
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,600
DT times whatever our Spring Forest is going to be here.

1119
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,900
So this is our like spring velocity or head Spring, right?

1120
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,100
And so our head spring is going to be exactly what I typed in before.

1121
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,800
So, it's the head position.

1122
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,400
We know where the body is.

1123
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,200
We want the head to go towards the body.

1124
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,900
Like so and we want that to be multiplied by some kind of a

1125
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,600
coefficient here.

1126
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,800
I don't know what it is.

1127
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,800
And then I also want to dampen the velocity and I again I don't know

1128
00:58:52,800 --> 00:59:00,000
what that is but I want to take whatever the whatever that velocity is

1129
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,400
of the the head at the moment.

1130
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:06,200
And I want to dampen it so whatever that is is going to get subtracted

1131
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,400
that make sense, and then we're going to add that head spring directly

1132
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,700
in.

1133
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,000
So now you can kind of see there is a head spring, its operating, it's

1134
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,400
just not particularly forceful.

1135
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,500
So, you know, I'm going to crank it up a little bit.

1136
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
And then I'm gonna play with it.

1137
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,200
So now you can see like because there's such a strong spring on me.

1138
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,700
I can't really go anywhere, right?

1139
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,000
So I kind of have this this sort of very strong pull back spring.

1140
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:45,800
So I would need to sort of tighten up, if you will the see what's

1141
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,400
going on here.

1142
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,800
I need to to make more forceful.

1143
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,700
The other end, the, the actual movement code for the head, right?

1144
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,500
If that makes sense.

1145
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,600
Cuz that's just too forceful.

1146
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,400
Let me see.

1147
00:59:59,600 --> 00:59:59,800
I am.

1148
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,500
Little.

1149
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,000
I wonder how much of that though is also just the fact that I'm, I've

1150
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,300
got other kinds of drag and stuff like that in there, but in fact, let

1151
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,900
me just see what happens if there's already dragged on the dude.

1152
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,900
Let's see what happens.

1153
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,800
That just doesn't look right at all.

1154
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,100
Something is something is off and I suppose, that's probably just cuz

1155
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,500
you know, I'm doing something really ridiculous here, right?

1156
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:38,000
I mean, I don't I have to go look to see even what this is going to do

1157
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,300
because I don't know when the head DP gets can, I don't know how the

1158
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:41,700
head deep.

1159
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:45,100
He gets worked with in other parts of the code, but you can see like

1160
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:48,800
how heavy I have to make the spring in order for it to move.

1161
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,100
The reason that I'm a little weirded out by that, it's because you can

1162
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,100
see how heavy I have to make the spring in order to make it move back

1163
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,100
at a reasonable rate.

1164
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,200
But then I can't move the head at all at that point, it doesn't make

1165
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
much sense you know.

1166
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,300
It really doesn't.

1167
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,800
So I'm going to go ahead and comment this out just for a second.

1168
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,600
I want to make sure I didn't mess up something else.

1169
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,300
Right.

1170
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,600
Because there's the, the normal speed of the head.

1171
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,600
So you know I feel like we probably want to go in there and fix that a

1172
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,900
little bit because it's kind of, obviously wrong at this point but

1173
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,800
what I'm going to do is I'm for you know for the moment I'm just going

1174
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,700
to go ahead and play with this a little bit just to get it to a point

1175
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,700
that's reasonable, but I think we want to go ahead and fix this.

1176
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,400
So, the other thing that I could do here is I can make it so that I

1177
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,800
know whether the head is moving, if that makes sense.

1178
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,400
So what I could do is I could say, well okay, I'm going to know

1179
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,800
whether or not the con hero stuff.

1180
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,300
I have this piece of information on the con hero I could say.

1181
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:11,500
Well you know depending on on what the the con hero DDP is for my

1182
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,700
particular hero.

1183
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I will either apply or not.

1184
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,400
I that drag Force based on that, right?

1185
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,500
And that, you know, that would probably be another way around, so it

1186
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,600
was maybe the best way around it so that the spring Force, so the head

1187
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:32,200
Springs back, doesn't the head spring doesn't affect the rest of the

1188
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,400
rest of the situation.

1189
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,300
And again, I what I really want to do, I think is make it so that this

1190
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,400
guy actually knows.

1191
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,800
In fact, I could just do that and he actually seeks back towards the

1192
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,500
body when he when he's not in that mode.

1193
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,300
So maybe let me

1194
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,900
Let me maybe just do it that way.

1195
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,800
So in here, what I'm going to do is say well, okay, you know, we've

1196
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,800
got this sort of thing and I'm going to set the D DP equal to this

1197
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
this head spring value, right?

1198
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:07,200
When the GDP is is not a thing.

1199
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,000
So like if GDP,

1200
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,300
When no one's applying any force on the controller or maybe, when

1201
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,000
there's a very little force on the controller.

1202
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,700
So, when this is less, you know, then some nominal value

1203
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,000
Then we will apply the spring.

1204
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,400
I don't know what the value should be though.

1205
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,000
So that makes some sense.

1206
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,600
And so then really all we need to do here is we just need a way of

1207
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,700
making that that body value be exposed to us and the way that we would

1208
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,800
do that is the same way that we did it here, right?

1209
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:48,600
So you can see that we sort of do this system entity part here where

1210
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,800
we grab out the head course I'm going to be called Head.

1211
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,500
We should probably rename those anyway.

1212
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,800
So you know, here we are in this piece of code and we

1213
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,500
say, okay, if

1214
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,300
If we actually got a valid body out of this, you know, go ahead and

1215
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,000
compute it.

1216
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,000
And that'll add that restorative force.

1217
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And so now, what we would need to do is when we add a hero or guess,

1218
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,800
it's a bad player,

1219
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,900
We need to have them both Point towards each other.

1220
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,900
So it would look, you know, we need to have the heads low Sim had a

1221
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,500
hit on next point back to the body and vice versa.

1222
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:33,900
So they're kind of like pointing at each other and they know who's

1223
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:34,300
who.

1224
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,300
So you can see that it's not doing any restoration right now, that's

1225
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,500
because this world was already created and doesn't have that part of

1226
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:40,800
it.

1227
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,700
And now, so if we rerun it in theory, now we should get that

1228
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,700
restorative Force.

1229
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,300
oh my

1230
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,600
Huh.

1231
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,800
That's of course we don't have that velocity damping.

1232
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,100
So that's an under damp spring, but it's way cooler when it has a

1233
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,300
facing direction to it.

1234
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:58,900
Right.

1235
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,200
All right, so last things last.

1236
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,400
Let me go ahead and finish that up.

1237
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:07,600
Head P.

1238
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,400
So, yeah.

1239
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,400
Let's go in here and

1240
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:17,900
And see.

1241
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:23,300
So here's our GDP it doesn't have any notion of I guess it gets his

1242
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:28,800
part, it's got dragged on it and I guess the question is the drag is

1243
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,600
not enough.

1244
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,200
Maybe and I suppose, what we could do is add more drag here because

1245
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:42,400
maybe we want a certain amount of drag built a different drag for our

1246
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,600
general motion or not.

1247
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,300
But so, what I'm going to do here is say, like, okay, I want sort of a

1248
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,700
negative force to be applied.

1249
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,600
I don't know how much, but for whatever the end of these DP is at the

1250
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,500
moment, we're going to counteract that in this mode, only, right?

1251
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,900
when we get down there, you know, we kind of got this nasty problem of

1252
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,200
that oscillation

1253
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:19,100
like that's probably good enough and we just I would say we probably

1254
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,200
want to go fix the way the facing Direction stuff works at the moment

1255
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,300
because

1256
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,000
I think motion wise, that's probably correct.

1257
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

1258
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,800
Motion wiser think that's probably correct.

1259
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,600
And there's another thing that I want to do two, which is, I want to,

1260
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,000
I want the motion to be biased along the Cardinals.

1261
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:49,100
So the other thing that I would want to do here is really, I want this

1262
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,700
thing to be per element.

1263
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,600
So you know what, I really want to do here is say something more like,

1264
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:06,100
you know element or equal 0, you know, e is less than 3 + + e.

1265
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,100
And I really want to do this.

1266
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:08,400
Check

1267
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,900
To see whether you're applying force in a particular direction.

1268
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,000
If you're applying force in that direction, I don't recenter the head

1269
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,200
only along that axis.

1270
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,700
So, essentially what I'm saying is, you know, if you've got the head

1271
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,200
and you've got the body, if the head gets a little off to the side,

1272
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,300
but then you're pushing upwards and you're moving the head.

1273
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,600
This way, I want to suck the head back over here.

1274
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,000
If you're not still trying to move laterally and the same goes for

1275
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,500
this way.

1276
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,900
So I always want the head to be centered roughly on the body.

1277
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,400
I want the spring to restore the

1278
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
Head back to the center of the body.

1279
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,400
I always want that to happen.

1280
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,600
If you're not moving in that direction.

1281
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,400
So rather than do the spring Vector wise, you know, I didn't think of

1282
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,000
this before, but rather than doing it as a single Vector.

1283
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,200
What I actually think I want is something more, you know, like like

1284
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:04,000
this and actually remember how we access elements is it just .e.

1285
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,300
I'm not sure.

1286
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,700
Is that how we do it?

1287
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,100
Yeah.

1288
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,600
So I'm going to take a look at that just real quick because that's

1289
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,100
just another thing that I kind of wanted their that makes sense.

1290
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:35,000
I did something bad.

1291
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:36,300
Not sure what.

1292
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,700
That's very different than what we had before.

1293
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I don't feel like it should have been if D DP e is less than 0.1 then

1294
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
apply.

1295
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,800
The body - the entity in that, just whatever that direction is.

1296
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,100
and then,

1297
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:20,300
Again, whatever that.

1298
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,700
Velocity is.

1299
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,600
Why does that not work?

1300
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:41,200
I color me confused about that because that should be fine, right?

1301
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,100
Here's my Baseline.

1302
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:03,000
Oh, was that a length squared that I did there?

1303
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
That might have something to do with it?

1304
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:24,500
So let's see if it's less than some very small value.

1305
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,100
Let's say,

1306
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,500
No.

1307
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,200
How about just if

1308
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,500
oh,

1309
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:34,800
Awesome.

1310
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:35,600
Yeah.

1311
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,200
How about you?

1312
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,900
Take the absolute value of that?

1313
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,200
That was stupid.

1314
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:47,400
Okay.

1315
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,100
So if we take the absolute value this, we want to know whether the any

1316
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,200
given individual component has gone more than a certain amount.

1317
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Not sure what that amount should be.

1318
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,900
Still feels wrong.

1319
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,400
What did I mess up?

1320
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,700
This is going to drive me nuts.

1321
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,900
Because that's like the same equation we had, right?

1322
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:36,000
I just have no idea.

1323
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,700
I'm like, literally clueless, I think this is what happens.

1324
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,500
Maybe you get too old.

1325
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,500
You get confused because I'm taking a look at that.

1326
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,800
I mean, let's just make it a ridiculous value.

1327
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,900
I mean, that should not be applying at all.

1328
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,800
I mean, how can this value?

1329
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,500
Even how could it possibly be less than that?

1330
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,600
I'm going to step into the burger is driving me insane.

1331
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,700
It's driving me, insane people.

1332
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,900
It's driving me insane.

1333
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,000
This is one of those ones where you know you're staring directly at

1334
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,500
it, right?

1335
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,500
It's like, duh.

1336
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,300
But your brain is just sort of mushy at this point and you're not sure

1337
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:32,700
what it.

1338
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,800
What is actually going on.

1339
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,600
Your like, I don't know what's happening, what is even math?

1340
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,200
I don't know.

1341
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,100
Just math exist, probably not.

1342
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:40,800
So,

1343
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,300
I just feel like I don't want to step into it in the butter until I

1344
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,100
actually have a feeling about what is actually wrong with it, because

1345
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:51,400
it doesn't make sense to me.

1346
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm going to go ahead and just verify to myself.

1347
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:00,700
Good.

1348
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:01,900
I can do either of these.

1349
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,800
So, there's my F1.

1350
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,300
Here's my DDP, right?

1351
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,200
That's the GDP value.

1352
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:14,400
I'm going to use and I'm going to say if I think what I did is like

1353
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,700
length squared, right?

1354
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,400
If the length rate of GDP is less than 0.1 F or something.

1355
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,100
I don't even know if I is what will return, it just think just to make

1356
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:28,800
sure it works.

1357
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,600
Then we just did this, right?

1358
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,100
I mean this is all, it was just the same exact thing.

1359
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:40,900
It just I didn't do right, I didn't do the components so there it is.

1360
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:42,900
Working just fine.

1361
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,200
Right.

1362
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,400
So now the question is, if I switch to doing the exact same thing /

1363
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,000
component, so I'm going to do it for 0 1 and 2.

1364
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,800
I want to do exactly the same equation.

1365
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:14,300
So for any given scalar value, I want to take the square of whatever

1366
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:14,700
it is.

1367
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,800
So whatever that element is DD PE and I'm going to say if it's less

1368
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,400
than same value, right?

1369
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,800
Then I want to take DDP of just that one component.

1370
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,000
I want to set it equal to the scalar version, right?

1371
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,700
Which is just the component.

1372
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,800
Minus the component, it's going to be pushing in the direction towards

1373
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,600
the body, which is what we want.

1374
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,500
And then we're going to negate that velocity Vector as well.

1375
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,800
And again, putting that it's just component wise so it's just whatever

1376
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,800
the component is.

1377
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:51,500
That's all we're doing.

1378
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,400
How is that not working?

1379
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,600
So does do, does everyone else know why it's not working?

1380
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,600
And it's only me

1381
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Hmm.

1382
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,800
Well, I guess I'll have to leave it till tomorrow.

1383
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,900
That's very unsatisfying but I'm out of time.

1384
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,400
You know what?

1385
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:47,100
I wonder if it's just because of the drag that gets applied

1386
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,200
afterwards.

1387
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,800
I think that is what it is.

1388
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,300
Because that drag force that gets applied in the movement routines,

1389
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:04,400
right?

1390
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:11,500
I could see that being the case cuz that

1391
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,900
I know exactly what it is.

1392
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,900
It's because I'm passing this to the movement routine, which

1393
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,800
normalizes the vector, that's what's going on.

1394
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,000
Yes, and that's just because I was hacking that together, right, once

1395
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,500
this goes into the movement routine, it's going to normalize the

1396
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,100
vector.

1397
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,500
So the normalized vector is going to have a totally different effect.

1398
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,900
So what I really want to do is not use this GDP at all, right?

1399
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,100
I actually just want to say

1400
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:47,900
You know.

1401
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,900
There's some other one here.

1402
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,000
That I'm going to create and then when I'm done, I'm going to add that

1403
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,700
in just straight away, right?

1404
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:07,800
So I've got that DDP and I'm going to go ahead and say like entity,

1405
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,400
you know, DP plus equals DT times GDP to or something like this,

1406
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:13,900
right?

1407
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,100
Yeah.

1408
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,600
So that was the entirety of the problem.

1409
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,000
Make sense.

1410
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,300
All right.

1411
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,200
We got to do a bunch of work here, but we're starting to get pretty

1412
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,300
respectable, right?

1413
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,700
This is, this is going to be pretty cool.

1414
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,000
I can already feel like this is actually going to be good.

1415
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,400
So I'm glad about that because it was going to feel bad.

1416
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:55,700
That would be bad.

1417
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:35,400
Let's see the other day in Janeiro, like, in the New Movement, to

1418
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,200
Crypt of the necrodancer.

1419
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,000
I like that game and see where they're coming from, but handmade hero

1420
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,300
already looks like, it feels so much sweeter to play.

1421
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,700
Yeah, I think it'll probably feel pretty sweet to play this game.

1422
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:51,100
It's like, I feel like the design is pretty unusual and I feel like as

1423
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,800
I'm playing with getting this working here I can already feel like

1424
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,200
it's going to be pretty awesome to move, the guy around and do stuff.

1425
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:58,500
So

1426
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,100
I've probably missed it.

1427
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,000
But what exactly, prompted, switching the hero movement from analog

1428
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,600
ruling to digital tile-based wiggle hopping?

1429
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,100
It's the design of the game.

1430
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,700
So I have the design now and I'm like, doing it specific to the

1431
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:17,100
design.

1432
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:22,100
So the design requires, it's got to be towel-lined.

1433
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,600
And to be more clear, it's not tile aligned.

1434
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,900
I happen to set up a grid here because I think most screens or a fair,

1435
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,800
number of the screens are going to be grid-like, but actually, it's

1436
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,100
just, it's fixed point.

1437
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,600
So we could arrange those points in screen.

1438
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:41,000
Anyway, we want, but you, you have to hop between points is the

1439
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,800
important part.

1440
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,300
See pots, doesn't math exist.

1441
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,800
Who knows in DD is the body.

1442
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:54,400
Always going to move on a fixed grid, not necessarily a grid.

1443
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:59,500
But always from point to point the head can move the head gets to move

1444
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:05,400
sort of freely but the body has to be on the closest whatever point

1445
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,700
and the level generation will put down the points in specific patterns

1446
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,400
and you have to hop through the points.

1447
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,300
Can we get a keyboard cam?

1448
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:44,400
No.

1449
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,200
Lou Melon 55 with a player.

1450
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,300
Be able to see the points in the design.

1451
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,000
Yes.

1452
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:57,600
I mean

1453
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,500
Well, I mean, let me put it this way.

1454
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,500
The art will make it very clear where the standing places are.

1455
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Unless there's a particular reason in that area for you to not know.

1456
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,500
SEL de is the body.

1457
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,300
Going to lean towards a header is going to stay detached.

1458
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,100
It will lean.

1459
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,700
So as you move will like sort of stretch it, you know, will like

1460
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:22,700
stretch it kind of this way.

1461
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,100
It's going to be a little hard, like it's a little bit tough and this

1462
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:27,700
is this is true.

1463
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:31,100
Anytime you do animation and games, you kind of always have to fight

1464
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,600
the fact that the animation doesn't look as good because you don't

1465
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,200
necessarily know exactly what the player is doing, right.

1466
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,600
You don't know if they're gonna like go this way and stop or what's

1467
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,200
going to happen.

1468
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,100
So the degree to which it can kind of go down, it's going to fight.

1469
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:47,000
I need to stretch to detach the head so it's definitely going to be

1470
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,500
the case that it's a little bit.

1471
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:55,000
That it's a little bit less good-looking than it would be if we didn't

1472
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,400
care about the feel but the most important thing is that the head

1473
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,800
feels good to control.

1474
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,800
And so that's kind of going to happen.

1475
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:05,500
In DD.

1476
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,100
Shouldn't the head?

1477
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,500
Always draw on top of the cape?

1478
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:08,900
That's RZ problem.

1479
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,400
So right now, we have to go do this.

1480
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,000
We can probably do this very soon right now.

1481
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
All three of these guys are actually at the same Z which is messed up

1482
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,200
to a large extent.

1483
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,100
And and so we've got a bunch of work to do with this or are sorting

1484
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,700
because we now we didn't have sorting in the renderer back when we

1485
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,500
made this stuff and we do now.

1486
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:32,200
So we need to go actually have that stuff work properly.

1487
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,900
But but like right now

1488
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,500
I can see that it's not at all.

1489
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:40,500
What you would want in the art assets, the way that we've got it,

1490
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,700
in here is is totally bogus, unfortunately,

1491
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,200
So here is like the Sprite so you can see like the positioning of them

1492
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,700
is totally like wrong.

1493
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,000
You want them to be just where they are and then in the game, we move

1494
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,100
them up so you can tell that it's like a higher thing right now.

1495
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,300
It doesn't know that because if they're actually at the same point and

1496
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:10,000
then they're displaced with inside the bitmap, which is not what we

1497
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,100
actually wanted.

1498
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:11,700
So,

1499
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,700
In DD.

1500
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,600
No sorry, Trevor new.

1501
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,500
Twill other entities.

1502
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,400
Only travel on these points to or can they move freely?

1503
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,300
So, it's sort of both.

1504
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:43,500
Like, I think for the most part things move on the points, but there's

1505
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
definitely a couple things that are like these.

1506
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,800
Maybe don't have to, some of that will depend on, what I, what happens

1507
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:51,100
when I put it in and we'll see.

1508
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,300
But definitely a fair number of the entities, have to still move on

1509
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:55,700
the point.

1510
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,700
So we will have to write some code that moves.

1511
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,800
Is that has a eyes that move along the ground?

1512
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,300
Ed or loose Network because doesn't have to actually be a grid.

1513
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,200
So they'll have to kind of path find around on it.

1514
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:11,000
Is there a name for this technique of blending canned, and simulated

1515
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,700
animations.

1516
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,700
Is it a common thing allowed in animation 3D packages?

1517
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:34,300
I guess I don't know if there's a name for it but it is the answer as

1518
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,300
to whether or not it's allowed in animation 3D packages.

1519
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,400
The answer is sort of yes and no.

1520
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:47,100
Animators will often write expressions that control elements of like a

1521
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,300
bone system.

1522
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,400
To basically turn it, like not even a bone system, but like, a

1523
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,300
hierarchical system to turn it into something that sort of works that

1524
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:01,200
way, but it has to be a parameter of T directly, so it can't really

1525
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,200
use physical simulation like we've got here.

1526
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,900
and so, in order to actually do what we did where it's based on the

1527
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,400
physics of the situation,

1528
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,200
the support for it in animation, packages is pretty janky because they

1529
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,400
physics is always really at odds.

1530
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,300
With the way these animation packages are, were written, originally

1531
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,900
and so it's always kind of shoehorned in and you kind of have to do

1532
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:30,400
these like baked procedures and stuff to like say Okay, run through

1533
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,600
the animation from the beginning.

1534
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,700
Do the simulation part bake that into a channel and now use the

1535
01:25:35,700 --> 01:25:36,000
channel.

1536
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:36,700
So it's like

1537
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,500
The answer is yes, it's common.

1538
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,500
Yes you can do it in packages.

1539
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,300
Is it anywhere near as easy as what we just did know which is kind of

1540
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:52,700
terrifying but you know that that depends on the package to a certain

1541
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:53,500
extent.

1542
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:55,900
So

1543
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,200
You know, some packages, there's easier than others to do if you're

1544
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:02,000
trying to do a mixed thing.

1545
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,900
Where you've got certain parameters of the model are being controlled

1546
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:11,200
by a physical element, as opposed to, you know, an animation timeline.

1547
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:17,500
Messy old.

1548
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,400
The why would I use an animation package?

1549
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,800
Instead of doing what you just did and whatever you will do?

1550
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,200
Well, the reason for that is, I mean, first of all, part of the answer

1551
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:29,700
is.

1552
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,600
Well if you're an indie developer or you're a one-man shop, like we

1553
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
sort of are on handmade hero, right?

1554
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,700
Like handmade hero basically, we've got art coming from youngji and so

1555
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:46,100
we don't have to do a lot of painting and stuff so that's pretty.

1556
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:46,700
Great.

1557
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,200
But pretty much everything else we have to do ourselves for the most

1558
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:49,700
part.

1559
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:56,600
So if you're in that position, you know, you you would do a lot of it

1560
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,500
like this, and you would try to

1561
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,900
Demise the amount that you would need things to be sort of more

1562
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,300
hand-animated eat, right?

1563
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:11,200
But if you are working with some talented animators, well, you know,

1564
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,200
they are trained to be able to sort of place timelines and make sort

1565
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:22,000
of more elaborate sorts of animations that happen, and it can be very

1566
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,900
difficult to hand code in animation.

1567
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:29,700
I mean, trying to give a good example but, you know, let's say you are

1568
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,800
Thinking of, you know, Call of Duty or something, right.

1569
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,600
And you've got this, you know, we've got this Kevin Spacey character,

1570
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,100
and you're doing, you know, whatever.

1571
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,000
You're not going to code that physically, it's not even plausible, how

1572
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
you would do that, right?

1573
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,600
You're going to use motion capture, you're going to have animators who

1574
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,500
sit there and tweak the values and get it right or whatever.

1575
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,900
There's just a ton of data that has come in and all of its subjective.

1576
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:56,200
It's not physically simulated really, it's about muscle movements and

1577
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,400
all these sorts of human things.

1578
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:02,400
So, once you cross a threshold from a visceral physical sort of

1579
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:05,900
Animation style into something that's more about acting, that's more

1580
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:06,600
about those are things.

1581
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,100
It's not feasible to hand code,

1582
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,300
All the reactive versions of these necessarily, right?

1583
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,800
It's just too much and we don't even necessarily know how sometimes to

1584
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:17,500
do those things.

1585
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:20,000
So usually the answer is, you know, why wouldn't you do this?

1586
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,200
Well, for a game, like a maid here?

1587
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,900
Oh, you probably would, I mean, I think physically animations kind of

1588
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,300
a good way to go for this because it's going to be very kind of

1589
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:30,300
dynamic and interesting, but that's because there's not a lot of

1590
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:31,100
animated pieces.

1591
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,600
There's not a lot of like facial animations or not.

1592
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,700
There's not a lot of these things that involved in putting tons of

1593
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,300
data.

1594
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And so I think when you cross that threshold,

1595
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,500
Then you, that's why you need to start looking at how you get tools,

1596
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,700
where animators can basically input subjective, non-physical sequences

1597
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,600
that you can then make use of in other ways.

1598
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,100
At revenue.

1599
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,200
Is there any plan for eventual addition of music?

1600
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,500
Music is basically done.

1601
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:03,900
I mean, we only have a little bit more work to do we you can probably

1602
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,500
even turn it back on the current build.

1603
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,200
You know, we've got a music file and I plays so all will be doing for

1604
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:14,300
music is basically like adding the ability to kind of fade in and out

1605
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,900
between different types of music, depending on the area.

1606
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:21,000
So that, you know, when you move from one place to another,

1607
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,000
You'll change what music you get.

1608
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,500
So,

1609
01:29:34,300 --> 01:29:37,700
Ham-handed question, could you use neural networks and make something

1610
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,800
like Boston Dynamics is Big Dog?

1611
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:47,300
You know, I'll be honest with you, I don't know anything about what

1612
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,500
the controllers were on Big Dog.

1613
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,800
They didn't used to use neural networks like, because Boston Dynamics

1614
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,600
is was originally.

1615
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:59,100
Most of their robotic algorithms are based on raber, Hopper code,

1616
01:29:59,100 --> 01:29:59,800
which is not a neural.

1617
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,300
Work.

1618
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,700
So I didn't I don't know what big dog is or whether there's any neural

1619
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,700
networks in it or not, but regardless, I just have no perspective on

1620
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:08,900
that.

1621
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:13,900
I don't, I haven't read up on any of that stuff so I have no idea what

1622
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:19,100
they do for that and I don't know if they use them.

1623
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,600
I don't know if they didn't use them.

1624
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,000
If you could use them, I have no idea because I really just don't know

1625
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,900
what Boston Dynamics is.

1626
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:26,800
Doing these days when they were doing Hoppers, there's no neural

1627
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,500
network required.

1628
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,700
So most of their robots

1629
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,600
Generally did not need any neural networks.

1630
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:35,800
They just balance using standard balance algorithms from Raber's

1631
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,200
thesis and further.

1632
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:37,900
Right?

1633
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,500
But you know, who knows what they do?

1634
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,100
Now, I've no idea.

1635
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:47,200
so,

1636
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:18,800
All right, so I think we're good.

1637
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,800
I'm going to close it up.

1638
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,900
Okay, I should probably save this as well.

1639
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,100
Thank you everyone for joining me, for another episode of handmade

1640
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:34,200
here.

1641
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,800
It's been a pleasure coding with you as always and it's kind of fun to

1642
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:37,900
see our little hero.

1643
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,000
Fellow starting to hop around in a couple more days.

1644
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,700
We'll probably have some good controls sort of finished for our guy

1645
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,600
here, which is kind of good.

1646
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,100
It's something we can start to base the feel on and make sure that

1647
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,900
everything is kind of doing good.

1648
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,000
As we kind of go in there and plus as we sort of, get a little further

1649
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,300
down that path.

1650
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:58,100
Maybe we'll, you know, Implement an enemy and will Implement a couple

1651
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:00,900
things for real and get them kind of working that will allow us to.

1652
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,500
Look at the end of the

1653
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,400
And go through and do a pass on that, to get that into a relatively

1654
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,800
good shape, because we don't really have one right now.

1655
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,300
And what's in there, it's kind of just from our original Explorations,

1656
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:12,900
so we're in pretty good shape.

1657
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:17,700
I'm pretty happy about it and it's looking kind of nice, so that's

1658
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:17,900
good.

1659
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,500
And I was pretty psyched at how the movement was.

1660
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,100
Starting to feel.

1661
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,300
It needs a lot of work, certainly like I'm going to but I want to kind

1662
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:26,000
of get it so that it's animating properly first and then tweak that

1663
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,400
feel a little bit more after that.

1664
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,600
So I believe tomorrow is Thursday and we are not

1665
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,000
Streaming tomorrow.

1666
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:38,700
So it is going to be Friday's the next stream, until then, of course,

1667
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,400
if you want to follow along with series at home, you can always

1668
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,900
pre-order it the game on handmade here a.org and it comes to the

1669
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,300
source code.

1670
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,800
So you can play around with it at home.

1671
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:50,100
You can go to the forums if you want to ask questions, you can click

1672
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,100
on the patreon page.

1673
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,700
We want to support our video series, which is always available free of

1674
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,900
charge to everyone.

1675
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,900
You can go to our schedule about to find out when we're streaming's.

1676
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,800
If you have a question about

1677
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,900
I just said if we're on tomorrow not which we're not, you can go there

1678
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,600
