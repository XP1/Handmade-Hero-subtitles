00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,900
Hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero show.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,300
Rico to complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,000
We are at a point where I think the only thing left on our to-do list

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
before updating the art is, I was going to do some particle system

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,500
stuff.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Because I really don't know.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
How we actually want to structure.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Those four are the way that our game works at the moment, there's a

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,200
number of kind of subtleties about it specifically because we use a

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,500
localized coordinate system for all of our stuff and we want to have

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,600
very large worlds and not have particle systems be simulating, if

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,900
they're not nearby and all sorts of things like that.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,700
So there's not really very much to say about particle systems like on

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,000
hand be here.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,800
In terms of the core particle system aspect of it.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,200
I pretty much we took a two-day break a long time ago where I just did

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,500
particle system because we kind of, like randomly said, what should I

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,100
do for two days in between some stuff we're doing and we did

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,500
particles.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,600
And so those of you who have been following along have already sent a

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
seen me, talk about the general part of particle systems, the or

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,700
larian lagrangian stuff and generally how they work, there's not a lot

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,000
to them, they're pretty straightforward.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,200
And then it's just a question of how hardcore into physics.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
Do you want to go versus just hacking stuff?

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, so

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,700
So you can start to make your particle systems be relatively

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,400
physically rigorous as you go, and then it starts getting more mathy

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,000
certainly.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But in general, there really isn't a lot to the particle system part

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,400
of it.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,400
It's really just how much actual physics you want to bring in, is what

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,800
determines mostly the complexity of the of the math?

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,400
You have to understand but the actual particle systems part is not

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,600
particularly complicated.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,500
It's just hey we've got a lot of points there, moving around.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,600
That's about all there is to say.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
So really most of the complexity for

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,600
This is going to come in on the bookkeeping side of things, right?

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,900
It's how do we know where the particle systems are that we want to

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,500
simulate?

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,400
How do we know when we want to simulate them?

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,800
How do we make sure that when a particle system comes into view, it

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,200
looks like somewhat proper, you know

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,300
If it's fog or a waterfall or whatever it is, how do we make sure you

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
don't like, see it start up.

47
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,700
You know, I'm sure you've seen this happen in games before where

48
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,000
you'll be like walking into an area, and you can actually see like the

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,600
waterfall start falling when you get close to it because it's like,

50
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,600
hey, you got near enough to like trigger the particle system to start

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
or whatever but it was still asleep before.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,100
So now you've kind of got this sort of period so there's a lot of

53
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,900
stuff like that where, you know, it's it's

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,100
It's not really Central to the main part of the particle system or

55
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,700
understanding how to implement a basic particle system or even an

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,000
advanced particle system, the particle system part.

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,300
But there's all of this kind of bookkeeping, that, that is involved.

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
And that's really the part that needs to kind of get

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
Get hashed out.

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,100
And I wish I could say that was a pun.

61
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,900
I don't know that we're going to use any hash tables, maybe it we will

62
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,200
and then it will be a great pun.

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
But if not then not it's good.

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,600
So yeah, let me quickly on the on the Blackboard.

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,100
I don't know that we're going to have a full Blackboard session today,

66
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,300
because I think a lot of this is going to kind of have to be Discovery

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,100
sorts of stuff.

68
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,300
So let me just quickly say, kind of what the issues are that we're

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,300
facing here.

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,300
And then I will I will sort of jump into the code and just maybe start

71
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,700
to sketch things out a little bit today.

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,200
So that tomorrow, we can start implementing the parts of it that we

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
care about.

74
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,900
Okay.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,200
So just to remind everyone of kind of what's going on here.

76
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,300
We've got a virtual coordinate system, a sort of a localized

77
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
coordinate system that we do our Sim stuff in.

78
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,600
So typically you know, if we have something that you know, looks kind

79
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,900
of like this sort of a scenario where maybe we've got

80
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Let's say.

81
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,500
We've got, you know, the hero is here and this is a room or something,

82
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,600
you know, and there's, you know, some walls around but you know,

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,400
there's exits, you may be North and South exits here that sort of

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,700
thing that they can go through and whatever.

85
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
They're looking at this particular thing.

86
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,600
There's a simulation region.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,100
The simulation region probably comes out to about here perhaps.

88
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,800
So because there's rooms that are nearby.

89
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,200
We allow those rooms to be simulated so that enemies who are maybe

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,900
like in the room.

91
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,700
Next to you might come in or if they're chasing you they could follow

92
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,100
you things like that are all sort of on the table.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,000
So, you know, in this scenario, the important thing to remember

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
because it's been a while since we implemented the basics of this

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,600
stuff is that we really don't have any notion.

96
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,000
Of a world space beyond sort of the tile, like these sort of tile

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
chunks that we have and things are kind of relative to them.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What that means is that if we wanted to have a particle system that's

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,400
persistent that particle system, kind of has to be based around

100
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,000
somewhere so that when it actually gets rendered there's some way

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,500
which we know where it's where it is relative to the camera, right?

102
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,600
Because you remember what happened like you know we've got like a tree

103
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,300
or something that tree is packed into

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,000
Chunk.

105
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,500
And we know where the chunk is relative to the camera.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,200
So the way we know where the tree is that?

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,800
Where when we unpack it, we know it's there, right?

108
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,800
And particle systems are going to have to do something similar.

109
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,800
The particle systems are going to have to get unpacked in a similar

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,600
fashion where we unpack a particle system when we know that it's

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,700
within our view, or our simulation region, and we simulate it, we need

112
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
to do something similar.

113
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,800
I think for the particle systems now,

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,100
Thing with, with the particle systems.

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,500
Is that unlike our entities which we could pack down to fairly small

116
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,300
and probably will eventually one of the sort of ideas behind the end

117
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,700
of the system.

118
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,800
I was doing was to kind of do a streaming entity system, right?

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,400
Where you could pack edit, he's down to small.

120
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,700
Only the part you actually needed to remember about them and then you

121
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,000
blew them out into bigger entities when you're processing on them.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,100
So that you wouldn't have to constantly do loops through property

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,400
lists or things like this.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,200
But particle systems are not that way the state of a particle system.

125
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,700
Cannot be represented in a small amount of space.

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,400
If it is dynamic right now, there are other things that we could

127
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,000
consider here.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
And let me just quickly tell you how that goes, the way that I have

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,100
implemented.

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,600
I have implanted parks in the past on, on previous projects.

131
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,800
And this is also how particle systems worked in braid is that they're

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,500
actually deterministic and based entirely on a single T value.

133
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,500
So, for example, you know,

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,200
If you have particles that are kind of shooting out from a point like

135
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,000
an explosion, you actually just to generate the particle system.

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,700
You actually redo the entire particle system every time by using a

137
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,900
random seed.

138
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,900
And a t-value that just says, okay, I generate all the random

139
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,800
particles every time I move them, however, far they would have gone in

140
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,700
the time step T.

141
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,100
And that's how I do my explosion, right?

142
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,700
So then all I have to remember is like the location of the explosion.

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,500
The T value of

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Of the explosion.

145
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,100
And any time I could recreate that explosion.

146
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, the problem with this is it means that you fundamentally can't

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,900
have very interesting protocol systems.

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,300
And what I mean by that is that all of the particle systems have to be

149
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,400
completely based on T, which means that the particles themselves can't

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,300
really interact with anything that might be moving, right?

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,700
That might be transient.

152
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,000
For example, if I wanted to make my explosion bend around objects that

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
were in the way.

154
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,300
It could not do that if it was strictly based on T and the reason that

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,700
it couldn't do that if it was particularly based on T is because as

156
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,500
things move in the locus of the explosion.

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,900
Like, let's say we've got something that's moving this way, right?

158
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,600
Then the particles as they explode, should only be moving around this

159
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,300
thing, when they get here, right?

160
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,500
And as this thing moves over here, if the thing was entirely

161
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,600
regenerate, every time the particles that should have hit this thing

162
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,200
when it was here will no longer.

163
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,000
Or even know that it's there and they'll just they'll jump to a

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
different location discontinuously, right.

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
As this thing moves

166
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
so you end up in this situation where unless the entire thing is a

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
function of T which it can't really because this could be a player

168
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
with player input and stuff like that and so then you have to record

169
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
the player input and stimulate where

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
Things would have been as the T.

171
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,800
That means you have to individually step the objects which and

172
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,100
quickly.

173
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,300
This whole scheme, like blows up, right?

174
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,400
So F of T particles, like particle systems that work like this, where

175
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
you just input a single tea and you're done, they just can't be very

176
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,900
physically active, they can't interact with things in a very detailed

177
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,400
fashion and it's a big limitation for them.

178
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,000
So while we could do that on handmade hero and maybe we will do that

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,900
on handmade hero in certain circumstances, right?

180
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Like we could imagine

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,900
And so if we just have a particle system for a little torch that

182
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,000
flickers or something, you know, that's something that an F of T,

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
particle system could do just fine.

184
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,400
If we don't need a lot of dynamic of dynamism from things moving

185
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,200
through, the torture, who knows what happens to this torch?

186
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
Then, you know, it's not that big a deal, but

187
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,100
Assuming that we do care more about what happens to those particle

188
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,600
systems.

189
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,500
Then it just isn't very interesting even in the torch case if we want

190
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,900
things too.

191
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,300
Smoothly, animate through it.

192
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,100
And like, cause Poof's and things like this to happen, to that torch.

193
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,700
When something like shoots through it stuff like that.

194
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,100
You just end up in a circumstance where F of T, particle.

195
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,700
Systems are not going to be particularly good.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,200
What that means is, I think we want fundamentally and F of delta T

197
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,900
particle system, right?

198
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,600
Which is to say that each frame, we would input the amount of time

199
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,000
that has elapsed, and we will simulate all of our particles forward.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
And while we are simulating them forward, we can choose to do things

201
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,100
like intersection testing and allow them to respond to Dynamic objects

202
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,100
in the scene if we so desire.

203
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,700
Right?

204
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
So, a traditional physics update step for the particle systems.

205
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
This is how particle systems are often done.

206
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,000
This is probably the more common way.

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In fact that they are done F of T, is probably less.

208
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,800
Where, you know, just being able to dial Park system entirely from

209
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
just a single time value.

210
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Okay.

211
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,500
So the problem with the F of T system from our perspective, here is

212
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,800
that particle systems might be quite giant.

213
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,200
For example, let's suppose we want 4000 or 4096 particles in a

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,100
particle system, which isn't even that many particles for a particle

215
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,400
system.

216
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Actually.

217
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Gpus today are very fast.

218
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
You can push a lot of particles.

219
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,600
On a GPU.

220
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,900
So a single particle system of four thousand particles, not

221
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,700
particularly much.

222
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,100
But if you think about how much that would have to, that would take

223
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,000
for storage.

224
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Just that one particle system at 4096 particles.

225
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,700
If you imagine we were storing storing.

226
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:39,000
Even just say you know 16 or 32 bytes worth of data it quickly get oh

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,700
that's great.

228
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,000
It quickly gets quite large right you're starting to talk about.

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,800
128k 256k per particle system, that then has to be persistent, right?

230
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Best to be persistent in the world.

231
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,700
And if we are having very giant worlds, we don't generally want, you

232
00:11:59,700 --> 00:11:59,800
know,

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,600
There's like four or five particle systems the stream or a screen or

234
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,300
something like that that are now getting saved that's half a megabyte

235
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
per room.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,300
If we have even conservatively 500 rooms like okay you can just start

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,700
to see this start to multiply out here.

238
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Now we're talking about a quarter of a gigabyte just to store our

239
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,400
particle systems, it's just not particularly attractive.

240
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
As an option, right?

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Furthermore of this all this traffic of storing it out.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,700
And who knows what else, right?

243
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,700
It would break our chunk system, right?

244
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,100
Because our chunk system is based on streaming things in and out of

245
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,300
it.

246
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,200
Now you're streaming to way too much in and out of it.

247
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,300
So blah, blah blah blah.

248
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,000
So you know honestly it just doesn't seem like a particularly

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,100
compelling idea to me to store these particle systems in the world as

250
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,400
persistent things, especially because they don't really matter to the

251
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,800
gameplay in that way, right?

252
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,400
A

253
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,000
Cool.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,200
Particle system is therefore special effects and it to the degree,

255
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,100
which it does affect the gameplay.

256
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,800
Usually, that is at a more granular level than the individual

257
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
particles themselves?

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,000
For example, maybe I do have a flame on a torque that lights things on

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,600
fire.

260
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,200
Typically I don't test every particle to see if something hits it to

261
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,100
light on fire, right?

262
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,900
That could get prohibited expensive anyway, and might be too hard to

263
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,300
simulate, right?

264
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,100
So typically what I would do instead is I'll just test the region of

265
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,100
that thing and say, if something's in this region then I light it on

266
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,100
fire or and maybe add some poofing to make the particles go out but I

267
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,200
don't test every single particle, right?

268
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,900
On that thing necessarily.

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,800
You know what I'm saying?

270
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,900
And so, you know, I don't really need them for gameplay purposes.

271
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,500
I don't have to know where every particle was.

272
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
So if we forgot,

273
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,100
You know, where those particles were that wouldn't actually do

274
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
anything bad to the game.

275
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,200
All we have to do is make sure that when the player is actually

276
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,500
looking at the particles and their inside, you know, like the same

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,800
region.

278
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,300
Let's say that they stay consistent because we want them to look

279
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,300
consistent.

280
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Like, they're a part of the world and not all weird.

281
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,600
Jump, be erratic.

282
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,100
So obviously we want them to look consistent while you're looking at

283
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,300
them.

284
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,400
But after you're no longer looking at them, we really don't care what

285
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,200
happens to them.

286
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,800
We just care that when they come on the screen, stay on the screen and

287
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
leave the screen for that duration of time.

288
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
It always looked right.

289
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,700
And it looked plausible and believable like it was a particle system

290
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,700
that was have been, you know, something that had been stimulating the

291
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,400
entire time.

292
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,000
And so for our purposes, what I would propose and I think the first

293
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
sort of route that I'm going to take and we'll see how it works out.

294
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,900
Is I'm going to say that what?

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
What is sort of like cached?

296
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,400
Particles.

297
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,500
Right?

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,300
And I think this is a fairly common technique.

299
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,600
I mean, I couldn't tell you offhand.

300
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,500
How many people do particle systems like this?

301
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,900
But I suspect it's a reasonable number.

302
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,800
We're certainly not.

303
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,400
The first, we certainly won't be the last to attempt something like

304
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,800
this.

305
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,200
And the idea here is just that well, okay, if we already have the

306
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,800
notion of a simple simulation region, what if we just said, we've got

307
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,500
room for some number of particle systems, right?

308
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,100
So let's say we go.

309
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,700
Okay?

310
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,500
What's our biggest particle, you know, how many particles do we want

311
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,800
to simulate at maximum for any particle system?

312
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You know, maybe it's 64k particles.

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,500
Let's say how many particle systems do we want to simulate any one

314
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
time at maximum?

315
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,100
Okay.

316
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,300
Maybe it's 64 particles or something like this.

317
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,400
And maybe we just say, okay, that's the number of particle systems

318
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,500
that there are

319
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
Ever right.

320
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,900
And then we do is, when we unpack a particle system, we use its unique

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,300
ID to look up into a particle cache of 64 of these to see if we have a

322
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:14,900
match.

323
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,500
And if we have a match then it just simulates.

324
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,700
That particle system.

325
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,200
If we don't have a match, evict the oldest thing in that system like

326
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,500
whatever.

327
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,100
The least recently used particle system, was we evict it and

328
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,100
reinitialize?

329
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,500
This one

330
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,100
It's place, right?

331
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,400
So as things move into the Sim region that are particle systems, they

332
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,200
this happens, right?

333
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
And it's things, leave the region.

334
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,600
Well, they still stay in the cash potentially for some time depending

335
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,300
on how many other particle systems are actively being used inside here

336
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,100
but eventually they will get reclaimed when there are 64 new particle

337
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,000
systems that have come through the simulation region since it left

338
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,200
Right.

339
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,100
Or rather since it came on, I should say.

340
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
And so we can also prioritize these.

341
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,099
If we think that 64 is not enough to handle all cases and maybe there

342
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,700
were you know, we could say that there will never be more than 64

343
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,099
particle systems on one screen at a time but maybe when you get up to

344
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,900
nine screens there could be we could also do sort of a two-level

345
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,500
priority scheme where we could have particle systems that are that are

346
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,200
actively on the screen, are prioritized higher?

347
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,900
Or maybe it just in general, we could

348
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,900
That the further you are away from the camera the less priority you

349
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,100
get in terms of eviction.

350
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,500
So you know it might not be strictly least recently used it may be

351
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,000
more like distance from camera and so if you are closer to the camera,

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,800
we will preserve you at the expense of someone far away from the

353
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,900
camera in the event that all of the particles have been touched this

354
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,500
Frame.

355
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Or last frame.

356
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,500
And so we don't have one that we know we can throw away that isn't

357
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
going to be touched, right?

358
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,200
So yet what the eviction scheme would be, is probably something that's

359
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,600
a little bit more specific there.

360
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,300
But, you know, we could also just say, we'll just always set this

361
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,900
number high enough so that it can cash it right memory.

362
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,600
We have a lot of it and hey, you know, computers are fast.

363
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,800
So maybe just let the user have some fun with with that CPU.

364
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,500
They paid for and let it just simulate a lot of particle systems will

365
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,600
see if it Boggs things down.

366
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,100
If it does, we'll address it in some other way, you know.

367
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,700
70.

368
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,600
It will do whatever.

369
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,500
Okay.

370
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,100
So I think that's basically it.

371
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,700
That's really all I wanted to say about the particle systems.

372
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,600
Hopefully, you understand roughly what I'm talking about in terms of

373
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
the motivation there.

374
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,200
And now, you can kind of see roughly, what?

375
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I mean, in terms of cash particle system or a cash-based particle

376
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,100
system where we're talking about, you know, not really having a

377
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,400
permanent home for any individual particle system, rather just using a

378
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,800
cash to say when they're around there around when they're not.

379
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,300
They kind of disappear from existence then.

380
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,900
All we do is into our game permanent store.

381
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,700
We do have entities that themselves.

382
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Just Mark the fact that there is a particle system somewhere and say,

383
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,000
what kind of particle system it is and then that is all that we

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
actually keep in the permanent storage.

385
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,100
So hopefully, that makes some sense to you and you can sort of see

386
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,700
where I'm going with that.

387
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm going to hop over to code.

388
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't think there's anything else.

389
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,300
Of to say on the Blackboard but that is what I'm going to start typing

390
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,100
in is just a thing that kind of does that caching and allows the

391
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,600
particle systems to come in and out of being, then what we'll do

392
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,400
tomorrow.

393
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,800
I think because I've got about I don't know, half an hour or so maybe

394
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,300
a little more, I've got about a half hour to implement that.

395
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,600
Then what we'll do tomorrow is start to talk about.

396
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay, let's make some particle system.

397
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,700
And get them kind of functioning so that we can, maybe actually have

398
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,000
some entities that are particle systems, right?

399
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,600
And so this way we can have entities, you know, maybe we'll do some

400
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,000
stuff.

401
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,100
Like I said, look a little like fire, that burns and then I like to do

402
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,400
some that are a little more complicated.

403
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,200
Like maybe we'll do some ground level fog or something like this and

404
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,300
we'll see whether we want to have sort of the like the oil.

405
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Aryan sir.

406
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Out of occupancy stuff that I kind of talked about before we may want

407
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,200
to put in some of that as well.

408
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,700
I'm a little nervous about or larian occupancy stuff only because I

409
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,700
don't really know how well that's going to work in practice for things

410
00:20:59,700 --> 00:20:59,800
like,

411
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,900
Ground fog, I don't know after I'll have to see what we think.

412
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,000
So we're kind of going to have to play around with it and see what we

413
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
think about stuff like that.

414
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,600
But point being what play around with some of those and by playing

415
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
around with some different kinds of particle systems?

416
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,100
We can then sort of ask ourselves, what?

417
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Actually are the things we want.

418
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,400
These cash particle systems to have in them in terms of capabilities

419
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,400
and then we can build it out from there because the cache Works will

420
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,300
work the same way regardless, so I can Implement that today but then

421
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,900
in terms of what is actually in those particle systems and how

422
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,500
We sort of what parameters we expose to the game model to sort of like

423
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,300
be able to create interesting particle systems without having to go

424
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:45,400
like re-implement everything every time, you know, will depend on sort

425
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,700
of us.

426
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,100
Implementing some kind of example, particle systems that we think are

427
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,600
kind of like the ones we might want and sort of seeing.

428
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,500
Okay, what kind of support do we need here?

429
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,200
And, of course, you know, it's never the end of the world since these

430
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,700
things are just kind of, you know,

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Touring a bunch of data, the cash.

432
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
We can always extend to add new types of particle systems.

433
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,800
If we misjudge but we want to sort of put some in there to begin with

434
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,800
that we can use as we sort of do basic stuff in the game so we can

435
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,900
kind of see how the particles look and use them for nice effects and

436
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,700
that sort of thing.

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,200
Looks like I don't have a command prompt open so I'm going to go ahead

438
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
and open one up.

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,800
Today is day 3 36.

440
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,400
So you want to start with de 335 source code, if you're trying to

441
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,300
follow the changes that I'm about to make right now.

442
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,300
So compiling the game, everything I believe we left in a kind of a

443
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,700
relatively done State here in terms of stuff.

444
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
We were had been working on.

445
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,300
So yeah, there's my

446
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Little Hero hopping around and having a grand old time and off we go.

447
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,800
So let's go ahead and take a look at the Sim region stuff.

448
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,300
My belief is that this you know if you take a look at the way the Sim

449
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,000
region stuff, these Sim regions are kind of meant to like come and go

450
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,900
very sort of spontaneously throughout the run of the program.

451
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
And so the same region itself is not really the right place to put

452
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,200
this cash.

453
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,400
And the reason that it's not the right place to put this cash,

454
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Is because again a Sim region is supposed to be saying that just pops

455
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,700
up, simulates a region then goes away.

456
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,500
And so it can't store data from frame to frame.

457
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,800
That's not really what it does.

458
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
And I don't want to make it do that because I want to be able to use

459
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,900
it in ways, where I just kind of like create-a-sim region to simulate

460
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,700
something and then and then have it finished and just be done with it.

461
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
It's supposed to be transient that way and multi-thread about in that

462
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,100
way.

463
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,200
So what I need is I need the cash of particle systems to be something

464
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,700
that's sort of a separate thing, right?

465
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
So there should be like a separate.

466
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,800
Channel if you will of particle system cache information and when we

467
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
run a Sim region, if we give it a particle system,

468
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,000
Cash we then when it unpacks entities, it will go ahead and look in

469
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,900
the cache and update the cache.

470
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,000
If we don't give it a cash, it won't because remember the same region.

471
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,600
Is one of those things that we may want to use and we kind of talked

472
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,200
about this a little bit.

473
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
The other day, we may want to use it to simulate areas of the game

474
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,500
that aren't the player can't see where there are other things going on

475
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,400
that we want to know the outcome of so that when the player does get

476
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,300
there, they will see the results of them have happened.

477
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,400
So if we want that capability, we don't want to require those areas to

478
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,100
have their particle system simulated because that will take a bunch of

479
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,600
extra CPU time that we didn't really need to spend.

480
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,100
And because nobody can see those particle systems.

481
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,200
And so, the only thing that we want to simulate about particles in

482
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,100
that case is the gameplay logic part, which is something I want to

483
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,600
keep in the entities themselves.

484
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,700
So we want to make sure to segregate this and as I'm doing it, I'm

485
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,300
going to keep it very rigidly segmented.

486
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,500
In that sense, I want to make sure that the Sim region just uses a

487
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
protocol cash.

488
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,200
It does it sort of contain and require a particle cash and so that's

489
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,100
why I'm proceeding in the way that I am.

490
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:19,900
So if we go in here to to handmade Heroes code here, I want to just

491
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,400
copy.

492
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,700
I want to get a starter file here for like handmade particles.

493
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,400
Like so I still haven't.

494
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,700
I need to someday right?

495
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,600
For a coder.

496
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
My custom for coder.

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,700
I've never written the thing that like creates a new file and puts my

498
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,400
header in it.

499
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,800
I just I was too lazy for some reason so I just always copy an

500
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,700
existing file that has the header in it.

501
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,600
Real high rent.

502
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,000
I know.

503
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,400
So I'm going to create a thing for particles here.

504
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,700
And what I'd like to do is I'd like to start making that cash and I

505
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,900
want to because I kind of know what I want the usage code to be here.

506
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm going to write the usage code first.

507
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,600
I always used to say always right the usage showed first but after

508
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,900
kind of like I think it was Alan kind of asked me some good questions

509
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,700
about it.

510
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I came to the realization.

511
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,600
That really what I do is I write the side.

512
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,100
I know first, if I know exactly how the implementation should work but

513
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,600
don't know what the API looks like.

514
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,400
I use kind of a compression Style.

515
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Game to get there.

516
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,600
And if I know that I want the API to look a certain way, or I believe

517
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,700
I can determine it but I don't know exactly what the implementation

518
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,500
should look like.

519
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,600
Then I go the other direction and so I definitely have different modes

520
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,400
that I go in depending on what I know, right?

521
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,900
And it's worth noting that the hardest problems are when you know

522
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,800
neither side when you neither know, the efficient way to write the

523
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,600
actual code.

524
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,000
Nor do, you know what, it's a pi should look like.

525
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Then you're kind of in this really nasty, no man's land.

526
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,100
And it's kind of this problem.

527
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,600
It's a lot like a boundary value problems in mathematics where, you

528
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,200
know, things sort of

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,700
Are you have to kind of have these these guesses about how to get from

530
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,900
one place to another when you don't really know very much about

531
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,600
anything that's in between them, right?

532
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,600
And so those are kind of very hard problems to solve all across the

533
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,100
board.

534
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,300
Putting this case I pretty much do know, I think what I want at least

535
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,200
that cash part to look like so I'm going to start with that and let

536
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
that kind of build.

537
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,400
So what I'm imagining here, right?

538
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,000
Is that when I unpack these entities, so here's an example of like I'm

539
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,800
packing, these entities

540
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He's right, we go through and we scream out the end of these.

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Are you put those entities in there.

542
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,700
And then what I want to do is say like okay when we have an entity

543
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,400
Source, I'm kind of wondering why is there an if on the source there

544
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Does anyone know can the source ever be 0?

545
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,200
Look, look, I just got it at it.

546
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,700
Like, what?

547
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,600
That doesn't make any sense.

548
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,100
Oops.

549
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,500
How could that Source ever be zero?

550
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Oh, wait, no, it can be.

551
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,900
It's a pointer and if I'm, wow, I'm out to lunch today.

552
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,000
It can be right, these entity data's, I guess could keep it in there.

553
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Your personality index.

554
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,600
Although no, no, no, no, I'm not out to lunch.

555
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,300
It can't be

556
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:28,700
right?

557
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,300
I mean that's just it's they're all in the block if there wasn't an

558
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,200
entity there it wouldn't, it wouldn't have ever gotten packed.

559
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,300
So I don't know yet.

560
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,100
That's just dumb.

561
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,500
I don't know why that was there.

562
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,700
Nobody knows.

563
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,700
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

564
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:47,100
So anyway, when we go ahead and do the entity overlaps rectangle test

565
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
and we're going to mark this thing as active.

566
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,900
You can see that we do a brain thing where we add the brain in what

567
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,600
I'd also like to do is say okay, let's also say if the dest you know

568
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,500
particle something if it's a particle system then we would want to you

569
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,700
know get or create particle system kind of thing and we'd want to pass

570
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,500
this particle thing.

571
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:17,800
Probably although probably the ID for the entity might just be okay

572
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,500
because we have these entity ID things here where we can say like this

573
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,600
entity it has a unique ID.

574
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So really, I guess I can just use this so I just need to do something

575
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,600
where I say okay if my particle system

576
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,600
If this entity has a particle system, whatever that means, then I want

577
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,200
to get a create one with the particle system, you know, manager or

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,700
whatever.

579
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,800
So we have a particle cash and we'd say, if we had the particle cash

580
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,000
and this is the thing that wants a particle system, then we would ask

581
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
the particle cash, you know, to get one for us, right?

582
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,300
And I guess I could just say get particle system because, well, now,

583
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,300
I'll do get our create and I'll pass a True Value there.

584
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,200
That's like I want to create it.

585
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,100
So in case we want to just do a test or you say hey do you have one

586
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,600
here?

587
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Then off we would go right.

588
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,800
Now, I don't know that we need to pass anything else.

589
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,600
I think that might be all we need to pass and so when we do get a

590
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,000
create particle system here that will generate the product system.

591
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,800
Now, presumably the particle system probably also wants to know the

592
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,000
information about its location because like I said, it's kind of got

593
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,900
to do it Sim.

594
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,800
It's Sim stuff, right?

595
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,700
And so it needs to know like where that particle would actually be.

596
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,800
So probably in addition to that I guess and you know what, I could

597
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,400
just pass the whole entity I suppose.

598
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,000
So probably what I do is say all right let's pass Unity.

599
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,700
I guess I'm past the death penalty here.

600
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,400
So instead of the idsa, here's the whole entity create the particle

601
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
system for this for this thing and the desk P, it could look up

602
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,800
directly like now, it knows the location of this product go system

603
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,700
relative to the camera can just go ahead and do its thing right.

604
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,100
Okay, so I think that's probably all we really need from.

605
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,300
The first part of the API is to make sure that we do the gutter.

606
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,600
Create a particle system part.

607
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,600
We don't actually need the particle system to your turn to hear

608
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,300
because we don't care, right?

609
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,700
I don't think there's fundamentally anything that we need to actually

610
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,100
do about it yet.

611
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,200
We could.

612
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,400
I mean, in general, I guess we would say, for passing this entity I

613
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,000
suppose we could make this a little bit more generic, you know, maybe

614
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,700
I mean, I guess we could make this a little bit more generic.

615
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,800
We could do something like this.

616
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Say, hey.

617
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,400
All right, here's the ID.

618
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Here's like the data for the particle system in case you need to

619
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,300
create it and we could do something more like you know,

620
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,100
Like that.

621
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,600
So, you know, if this thing had a part of system in it, then, you

622
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,500
know, it gets recreated or whatever, from the base data that it needs

623
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
or blah, blah, blah, blah.

624
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,200
I've no idea.

625
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,700
You get the idea.

626
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,000
Okay, so suppose we did something like this.

627
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,900
Then we know that our particle cash would have all of the particles in

628
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,600
it that had actually been activated at that point, right?

629
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
And off, they would go.

630
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,700
Now, when I do get her create particle system, I suppose I should also

631
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,300
kind of, say something more like that this touches the particle system

632
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,800
as well.

633
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,600
So I could do something, like, touch particle system.

634
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,500
So, I don't know what I do here.

635
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,600
Particle system.

636
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,800
That that is say okay will touch the particle system as well.

637
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,700
And the reason that that's important, I think is because if we have

638
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,100
this particle system cache, I don't know that we want to always

639
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,800
require all of our entity.

640
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
To be intelligent about shutting down the particle systems when

641
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,000
necessary and what I mean by that is just that, okay?

642
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,200
So being a cash scheme, you typically have a situation where something

643
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,900
happens like all right, you know, take the exits, I already gave the

644
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,500
example of a torch, you know, we've got a torch.

645
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,000
And and, you know, it's on fire, right?

646
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,600
Yay.

647
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:28,300
So the Flames are burning around burning flames and the burning flames

648
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,200
are just like a particle system that we've created here, but later on

649
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,200
somebody like, you know, destroys the torch or I don't know what,

650
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,200
right, well, maybe you know, the person who wrote that code to destroy

651
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,500
the torch, like does something with the particle system to make it do

652
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,000
like a poof thing and make smoke in.

653
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,300
Case it's fine.

654
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,300
And in that case, they could Mark the particle system by saying, this

655
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,600
particle system doesn't need to be touched anymore.

656
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,400
It's on its own cleanup scheme or whatever, right?

657
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
But let's say that nobody does that.

658
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,199
Then in that case, we have a bug where when the torch goes away, the

659
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,300
flame will keep being there and it'll be there till the user walks off

660
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,900
and leaves the torch behind that it comes back and then the flame

661
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,000
won't be there anymore because it will

662
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,699
I've gone out of the cash hopefully at that point, right?

663
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,199
And so what typically I like to do in these sorts of cash based

664
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,900
schemes?

665
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,800
Incidentally this is the same way that I do things like that in.

666
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,400
I am gooey style systems because I like to have a notion of when I

667
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,100
have touched things on a frame.

668
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,000
So if I haven't told you anything about this torch on this Frame,

669
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,699
that's a clue to the cash system that whatever the thing was that was

670
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,000
causing this to exist is now gone or is not.

671
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
At the moment anymore.

672
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,699
And so you should start to take action to clean it up in a default

673
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,100
way.

674
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,000
So, for example, thing we could do is part of system is just fade them

675
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,400
out at that point, right?

676
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,000
And that means that yeah.

677
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,400
Okay.

678
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,100
Is it as good as if every piece of code that ever use protocol systems

679
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,600
always was able to perfectly, shut it down in some nice way where it

680
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
made the particle system.

681
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Do some animation that made sense and then cleaned up or whatever.

682
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes our do I want to be do I want to be paranoid enough to make sure

683
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,000
Sure, that that happens in 100 percent of all cases in a game that's

684
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,100
going to be as wacky as a simulation in this game.

685
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,600
No.

686
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,100
So what I'd rather do is design the system so that the failure case of

687
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,200
not doing that doesn't really create much of a visible bug.

688
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,400
It's a slight bug.

689
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,700
It's like not as nice as before, but it's not an obvious in your face.

690
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,200
Ridiculously stupid thing.

691
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,100
Like a flame that keeps on burning arbitrarily long, even though it's

692
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,500
torches gone, right?

693
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,000
So that's kind of more what I mean by that?

694
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,500
And so I just also want to include a that concept here of saying like

695
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,300
I'm going to want to get the particle system.

696
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm going to say that it's touched now like whoever this person is is

697
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,900
using it.

698
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,800
So you know consider it an act

699
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Of particle system basically and then you can fall out the code path

700
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,100
and we don't have to worry about anymore.

701
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
So now we've got our n Sim, right?

702
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:13,000
And the NCM doesn't need to really do anything because during the end

703
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,500
of the simulation normally we would clean up these particle systems

704
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,300
but we want them to persist.

705
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,400
So we're specifically not going to get rid of anything that we may

706
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,100
have done with prices.

707
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,600
They're supposed to persist, certainly need to do anything there.

708
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,900
All we need now is a place where these particle systems can be

709
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,900
Ernst, right?

710
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,700
And so what I would say about that is inside our entity system.

711
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,200
You know what we could do is we could Advance these when we simulate

712
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,700
The Entity or we could have the particle system stimulate on their

713
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,000
own, at the moment.

714
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,800
I guess I'll go with entity I'm not sure why I wouldn't.

715
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,400
But

716
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
It's hard to say.

717
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,900
Yeah, it's hard to say.

718
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,000
So here's what I'll do.

719
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
I'll just say that this get some packed.

720
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,200
And so this will be part of our unpack process.

721
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
So I will say like it goes from the source and it's not necessarily in

722
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,100
the dust.

723
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
So there's a, you know, a particle spec here.

724
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,000
And then cure in the dust will unpack it and record the active

725
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,400
particle system and and do it like so, I will also test the active.

726
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,200
Well, I guess I don't need to, I'll do that inside touch and so that

727
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
way I can say it's an unpack.

728
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,600
And so basically what we do is we have the particle spec it gets

729
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,200
unpacked essentially to the active particle system here.

730
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,000
Which is something that will track in the entity structure.

731
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,400
And so then when we come around and it's time to simulate our

732
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,000
entities, what we can do is during the Sim, right?

733
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,700
So when we're in here, we can simulate the particle system so we can

734
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
feel like an advanced particle system or you know, update and render.

735
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,800
Particle system.

736
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,600
Something like this.

737
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,700
So we've got that and that of course will need to take a bunch of

738
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,800
things here but first and foremost it would have to take the active

739
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,700
particle system.

740
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,000
It would also need to take presumably the

741
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,300
Part of cash.

742
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,500
I also don't know.

743
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,500
Do we know what R?

744
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,300
DT is?

745
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,400
Whereas R, DT at?

746
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,300
Yeah, so we also need our time step and we've got it.

747
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,000
So that's good.

748
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,000
We'll need our render information.

749
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,300
But other than that, I don't know how much more we would really need.

750
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,500
That's basically what we're looking at.

751
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,800
So,

752
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,400
But yeah, so now we kind of are starting to see the API.

753
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Take shape a little bit.

754
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,300
We have not initialized this protocol cash and we don't know where it

755
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,500
comes from, but it's a good bet that synthesis.

756
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,500
Something that only happens when you're looking at the world it seems

757
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,900
like the kind of thing that would probably be stored with the world or

758
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,200
the world mode, probably the world in this case.

759
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,000
But I don't know, it's a tough call because really it could be argued

760
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,900
that it's part of the

761
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
World mode because it's something that's purely visual.

762
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,100
But we could also say that it's part of the world in the sense that if

763
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,500
we had different modes looking at the same world that they what, you

764
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:37,700
know.

765
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,000
So six of one half-dozen of the other, I'm not going to worry about

766
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,400
that too much because we can move it back and forth pretty freely and

767
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,800
it doesn't really matter too much to us.

768
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,200
So I suspect the easiest thing to do here would be to just put it on

769
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,900
the world.

770
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,700
I don't see a way to get the world here though.

771
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,100
So I guess I mean, it's just World mode world if I remember correctly.

772
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,600
But

773
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,300
When you take a look at how much sense this makes, so we've got sort

774
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,600
of the, the chunk cash here and the chunk Astros, all the stuff inside

775
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,400
this world.

776
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,200
You know, does it make sense to sort of the protocol cashier?

777
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,100
I'm not sure one of the things that makes that a little bit odd is,

778
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,100
you can see that really, what's stored in the world is persistent

779
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,500
data.

780
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,100
So, you know, maybe that makes a little bit more of an argument

781
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,700
against that I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it one way or the

782
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,100
other, but you can kind of see why I'm a little hesitant there.

783
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,400
I'm just not 100%.

784
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,100
So I think I'm going to go ahead and put it in the world mode.

785
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,900
I'm going to put in the world minute so I'm going to say the particle

786
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,800
cash.

787
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,100
That comes from the world mode and then I think we can get things

788
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:53,900
started here.

789
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
So let's take a look at the particles side of things here.

790
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,400
I know that there's going to have to be some way of initializing this

791
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
thing, I guess.

792
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,100
I don't care about that quite yet.

793
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,600
Where's the rest of my stuff?

794
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,100
Here it is.

795
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,300
So, I know I'm going to have to have one of these.

796
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,500
And I know what it takes.

797
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,600
So, this is a active particle system.

798
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,100
Just called a particle system.

799
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,600
We have the DT.

800
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,400
And we have the render group.

801
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,200
So we know we've got those inside Sim region.

802
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
We know we've got these two

803
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,300
And we know that this is going to take a part of I'm sorry.

804
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,000
This is going to return a particle system.

805
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,800
And we also know what it takes.

806
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,200
There's the cash.

807
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,200
There's the ID.

808
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,200
And I don't really know if the ID values makes sense to use entity

809
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,800
idea specifically I guess I don't really know.

810
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,500
It might make more sense to just translate it over to you 32, but for

811
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,000
now let's just use any idea that's what they're always going to be.

812
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,800
I think so we'll just we'll just leave it that way.

813
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,700
And then we'll say particle spec.

814
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:43,900
And then a create if not found.

815
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,400
And then we've got our particle system.

816
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:54,900
Here.

817
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,700
not a great typing day, and then we've got

818
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,500
Our desire to touch this.

819
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,200
We want to touch it.

820
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,300
And so then we need something here.

821
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:17,900
For that.

822
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,400
So, yeah, so I think that's mostly what we need there.

823
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,300
And I guess now that I'm looking at the structure of this code, I can

824
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,200
see that actually having the entities render, the particle systems.

825
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,800
One at a time, I don't like because and the reason I don't like it is,

826
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,300
it doesn't allow fading out things past the point where they've been

827
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,800
destroyed or something like that, because of an entity gets destroyed,

828
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,100
won't be able to render its particle system anymore.

829
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,300
So, I think what I'd rather do is use

830
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,300
Of the, you know, I kind of went back present.

831
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,200
I think I can see from looking at the code there that I don't want

832
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,800
this at all.

833
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,300
That's not the way I want to do it.

834
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,500
When we do update and render entities, I'm going to want to basically

835
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,700
take update and render entities here and say, well after you update

836
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,400
and render the entities or whatever, you know, that's when I want you

837
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,700
to update and render the protocol systems as well and update them all,

838
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,300
please, I'm not going to tell you which one of these two do.

839
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,600
Because you're going to do them all and that way you can do one's even

840
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,500
that have not that don't have any entity associated with them anymore.

841
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,700
So you can have particle systems that have had their entity sort of

842
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,100
deleted or gone away and that won't actually affect anything for any

843
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:45,700
practical matter.

844
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,600
So, if we do update and render particle systems, now, we could,

845
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Do it like this.

846
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:57,200
And here, they'll be a for I Loop where we kind of go through, you

847
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,300
know, all of our particle systems or whatever.

848
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,800
Right?

849
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,900
And probably that looks more like this.

850
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,100
And the particle system.

851
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:29,200
Is here and so, oops to move that delete it.

852
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,600
So yeah, when we update and render the protocol systems, we're going

853
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,200
to go through all the ones that we actually have hoops.

854
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,600
For the closing parenthesis.

855
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,300
When we update and render, the particle systems, will go through all

856
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,100
the particle systems.

857
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,200
When we touch them, will make sure that they're marked for the

858
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,100
particular frame.

859
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,200
Having actually just this.

860
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,900
This should not be taking aspect though.

861
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,800
This should be taking a particle system.

862
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,000
yeah, and so that was just a

863
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,300
Wrongness.

864
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:11,700
And that starts to look pretty reasonable to me.

865
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:17,300
So, here we go with particle system and particle cash.

866
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,300
And, you know, maybe we just say that there's particle system systems

867
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,200
and there's 64 because I think that's what I said, and I don't

868
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,900
remember what we well, you know, I don't really want that.

869
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,900
I probably want these to be, you know, a

870
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,500
So ways to style things.

871
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:41,100
So, you know, it's probably pound Define Max particle count and

872
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,900
that's, you know, whatever it is.

873
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,900
And so then we just have something like this.

874
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
And so we're going to want will probably.

875
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,000
While we do the Protestants are will probably want to start bringing

876
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,100
in some similarity to the party here and so we'll probably want to

877
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,400
make this a little bit.

878
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:11,900
Not like what I'm typing in right now but you know, we'll we'll

879
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,400
probably have something like this.

880
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,700
I don't know exactly what but will probably want something that kind

881
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,800
of looks like this but we will want to be a little bit more.

882
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,400
We want to make sure those are 70 aligned and other sorts of things

883
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,300
like that so they won't quite look like that.

884
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,600
But you know something to that effect so we'll have these guys will

885
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,900
have them in our particle system and you know off we will go and then

886
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,800
in these particle systems in addition to all of our arrays and such

887
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,600
will need some kind of a preamble that's like oh hey yeah you know

888
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,400
there's an entity ID here that's the idea of the particle system and

889
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,500
will eventually need something like the number of frames since it's

890
00:47:59,500 --> 00:47:59,800
been tough.

891
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,800
You know, you know, something like this and, you know, we'll do more

892
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,200
in for, you know, we'll do something Smarter with this.

893
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,600
As we go, when we touch a particle system, you know?

894
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:11,900
Yeah.

895
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,600
Maybe we just say, okay, you know, frame since touched equals 0 and

896
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,500
maybe that's all there is to it for now.

897
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,900
Maybe we'll move them up in a list or a heap or something in the

898
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,500
future.

899
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,600
But then, you know, in here when we've got the sort of loop through of

900
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,800
the systems, will do something like this so that you

901
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,100
No, every time through, we sort of increment that touch amount.

902
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,900
And so then when we do get a crate particle system, what we can do is

903
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,400
when we Loop through to look to see if we've got a match, we can also

904
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,900
see who the oldest particle system is and then we can replace that

905
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,900
particle system.

906
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:50,000
Right now there's a caveat here, which is that we don't really know if

907
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,800
we replaced a particle system to laughter.

908
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,500
But what's interesting about that is that, I guess if we're not going

909
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,600
to have them be a simulated, we don't really need

910
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,700
To have this stored on the entity.

911
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,400
So we can just say now that, you know, we

912
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,800
Grab that particle system.

913
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,600
And then, you know, we do the touch up for it and off, we go, right?

914
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,500
So anyway, so if that's the case, then we can sort of see how we

915
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:19,600
would.

916
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,000
At least do the beginnings of the implementation here.

917
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,900
All we would really have to do and it's a little inefficient, but who

918
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,400
knows if we're only searching through 64 of these, it might be hard to

919
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,600
make it that much more efficient at all.

920
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,000
So, I'm not sure like a linear scan of 64 entries, may actually be the

921
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,300
best.

922
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,900
In fact,

923
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,800
we could just plan for that up front and say, hey,

924
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,200
Guess what?

925
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,800
There's just one array of those and we look through them, right?

926
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,200
And you can see like I didn't really, you know, I kind of wanted to

927
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,200
move that outside of there because I didn't want to have to do

928
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,500
when looking to the IDS, I didn't want to waste cash.

929
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,200
All of these IDs if there were 64.

930
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,700
Don't know why I'm going off in this right now but just to sort of

931
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,900
tell you why I just did what I did, you know, we know that it's four

932
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,900
bytes for an entity ID, right?

933
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,100
So for B times 64, particle systems is 256, bytes total luck if a

934
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,400
cache line is 64.

935
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,300
Bytes wide, that's for cache lines that have to get loaded in order to

936
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,000
check.

937
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,700
To see whether we have this particle system.

938
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,500
Now, forecast lines, being loaded is is very cheap.

939
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,600
And so, you know, scanning those is going to be real quick now, if on

940
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,600
the other hand, we stored it in the top of the particle system.

941
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,100
So if I did what I was saying before, now what we know is these

942
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,200
protocol systems are huge, so there's going to be no sharing of this

943
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,400
because this will sort of take up the rest of the cache line that this

944
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,000
sits in.

945
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,800
So, then,

946
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,700
Will happen is, we'll say, well, if there were 64 particle systems,

947
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,000
there's actually 64 cache lines that need to be read.

948
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,300
So it's actually 16 times more cache lines, that would have to be read

949
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,000
into the processor in order to know whether or not a particular

950
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
particle system exist.

951
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,700
They're not

952
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,400
And so, you know, it makes more sense for us to say, let's minimize

953
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,500
the number of cache lines and have to come in on that.

954
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,700
We could do that a little bit more in say, like, particle System Info.

955
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,900
Say, okay.

956
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,600
These two things are the things that participate in the scan, right?

957
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:44,100
And so we've got the info here and then the actual systems themselves

958
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,100
are separate.

959
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:49,900
Okay, so just thinking out loud, seems like a reasonable thing to do.

960
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:55,100
So if we were to do that, then inside the particle part of this,

961
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,800
right?

962
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,700
What we would say is like still Loop through the systems, but instead

963
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,800
make it the system infos.

964
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,400
And we just want to check.

965
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,200
Those right?

966
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,800
So we would say okay the system info zaidi.

967
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,400
If the ID equals that one

968
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:35,800
Then great, we're done our results is just whatever the system is that

969
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,200
corresponds to that one.

970
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,400
Right?

971
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,700
There's our result and we can stop looking now but otherwise we need

972
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,200
to find the oldest one.

973
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,000
So we would do like Min frames since touched and that would be like,

974
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,400
you 32 maximum.

975
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:58,800
To be nice.

976
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,800
Having you 32 maximum?

977
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,400
Somehow.

978
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,100
It looks like we do not have a u-32 maximum.

979
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,900
Yes, and now we have to do 1 billion, I guess we could just do this.

980
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,400
For 4 billion for billion in binary anyway.

981
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:36,500
So yeah, if we start out assuming that the max, you know, there's the

982
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,200
maximum there, then what we can do is say, all right.

983
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:48,500
if the Min frame since touched is greater than whatever this system in

984
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,100
foes,

985
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,700
Frame since touched is then, we want to grab it.

986
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
And remember this index?

987
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Right.

988
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,600
So, we would do.

989
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,300
That.

990
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:11,700
Right?

991
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,800
So since they were saying like, hey, we want to go ahead and track,

992
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,000
which one is which here?

993
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,300
Which one has been kind of the oldest and then when we fall out, we

994
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,000
could just say and I probably want to do it this way, or maybe just

995
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,600
call this replace will take replace.

996
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,900
So if we come down here and we say, we didn't find one.

997
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,600
We just use the one that we're going to replace, and now we'll have to

998
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,200
initialize the

999
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,100
Particle system.

1000
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,500
And we could actually do that in it particle system and say, okay,

1001
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,500
admit the result particle system in did it with this feck.

1002
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:57,900
Right.

1003
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,500
And this ID,

1004
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
Something like that.

1005
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,400
And so in here we would just have another call which is whatever needs

1006
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,600
to happen to get a particle system started.

1007
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,000
Which we won't really know what that is until we actually start

1008
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
writing some, right?

1009
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
But we'll find out soon enough.

1010
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,100
So here's the particle system, here's the entity ID and here is the

1011
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,200
spec that we will use to actually implement it.

1012
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,700
Right and for the moment protocol spec is just going to be you know

1013
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,500
empty, we don't know what it is.

1014
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,900
But we'll get to that later.

1015
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,100
Okay?

1016
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,100
So now what we need to do is actually start to fill in some of these

1017
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,500
things that are missing and I've got a little, I think I've got about

1018
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,500
three minutes left, I think I didn't start till 20 after instead of 15

1019
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:57,900
after.

1020
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,500
So it's going to take those three minutes to just tidy up some of this

1021
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,500
and then we'll be done.

1022
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,300
Now, I said that during begins him, I wanted to make this optional.

1023
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,500
So I want to basically say that you can pass a product cash if you

1024
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:16,200
want to, but you do not have to pass one and

1025
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,900
Also need to include these things because I haven't included them yet.

1026
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:25,200
And so if I go to handmade H, oops, that's not him A.H.

1027
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:28,900
There we go.

1028
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,900
What I want to do is include the particle systems.

1029
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,800
So now we've got them.

1030
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:53,800
And now we just need to flush out the and I should probably also

1031
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,600
before I forget include them here.

1032
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,500
I'm putting them above the stem region so we can kind of yeah.

1033
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:11,500
Oops.

1034
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,100
So there I think we're pretty good to go.

1035
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,200
I don't know why I called it particle.

1036
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,400
Cash, spelled all the way out, when that's kind of a waste of time.

1037
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,000
There we go.

1038
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,400
How do we compare?

1039
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:39,200
Two entity IDs, presumably there is already a thing for this.

1040
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:40,900
Right.

1041
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,200
I mean.

1042
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,700
Wouldn't there be?

1043
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Something.

1044
00:57:54,600 --> 00:58:03,800
Looks like is equal only happens for these guys and it looks like it

1045
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,500
also kind of short circuits that test of dot value.

1046
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:09,800
Yeah.

1047
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,300
Like this is kind of that test right there.

1048
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,100
So I feel like, I kind of want to start using one of these like is

1049
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,500
equal entity ID a and of the idb

1050
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,600
Result is a value equals B dot value.

1051
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,300
I think that makes me happier as a person.

1052
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,800
So I can do are equal or is equal.

1053
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,400
And be good.

1054
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,400
all right, so

1055
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,600
frame since touch is not okay.

1056
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:56,800
So yeah, that actually does pose an interesting problem, which I

1057
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,500
guess, I don't really know if I care about solving.

1058
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,600
So I think what I'll probably do is say we probably want people to be

1059
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,700
able to use this pointer.

1060
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,600
So I'm just going to use like an index here, which is just the system

1061
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,800
minus the particle cash systems.

1062
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,300
So it's going to say that's the offset, right?

1063
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:21,400
And so, then if I want the info, I know I can just do a particle

1064
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:21,900
system.

1065
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,600
Info.

1066
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,200
Info equals particle cash in photos.

1067
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,600
So yeah.

1068
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,200
Conversion from Institute for.

1069
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,800
Yes.

1070
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,300
Don't worry.

1071
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,300
There will not be that many particle systems.

1072
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,200
and,

1073
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,100
This was actually system in photos.

1074
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:53,400
So when we go ahead and do these, then in this case, When We're

1075
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,500
looping through both of them, we only do this Loop once.

1076
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,200
So I don't really care about how accessing is efficient here.

1077
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,100
So, I will just say we access both of them.

1078
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,800
And I will increment the frame since touch there.

1079
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,700
So I think now, we're just down to the entity storage stuff.

1080
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:20,900
I would suspect it looks like we function does not take three

1081
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,700
arguments, that's just because the particle cash isn't there?

1082
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,800
What is the problem there?

1083
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:27,900
Particle spec, right?

1084
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,100
So we need to get part of the spec in their broadcast on a member of

1085
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:31,900
game mode world.

1086
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,300
So, we just now are down to just the bookkeeping

1087
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,100
so if we come around to entity, what we should be able to do is

1088
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,600
include a thing in here,

1089
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,600
So we should do like has particle system and we should be able to do

1090
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:54,200
particle spec particle systems back or is it Spartacus back its part.

1091
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,200
And that information can be stored.

1092
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:02,200
There particle spec as part of Envy, I guess that would have to sort

1093
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,500
of jump up a little bit in priority, their particles would have tricks

1094
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,300
to be up here.

1095
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,000
That makes sense actually, but the problem with that is that entity ID

1096
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,700
isn't there.

1097
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:20,100
That's unfortunate entity ID is kind of a little too Primal at that

1098
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,300
point and there's no way to really organize those.

1099
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,600
There's no way to really forward declare them because they're actually

1100
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,100
included in the particle system info.

1101
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,000
So I kind of want entity ID to be moved up a little bit in terms of

1102
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,700
its thing there.

1103
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,800
How is the brain not use entity IDs?

1104
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,600
I guess because it's only runtime so it doesn't need them.

1105
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,400
Interesting.

1106
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,000
So I want to go ahead and move this end of the IDS up a little bit in

1107
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,100
terms of their precedence here in the include order because they're

1108
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:02,500
kind of like things that that are a little bit more used by everybody

1109
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,300
if that makes sense.

1110
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,000
Okay, so then in here, I can say that I want particles to be above the

1111
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,100
entity which cook has that structure there.

1112
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:17,600
The at this point, I'm just down to the world mode, not having a

1113
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,400
To cash in it because now we actually do have the the part of cash to

1114
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,000
pass here.

1115
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And so all I really need to do is have the world mode inside the world

1116
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,300
mode, have that particle, cash present.

1117
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,400
So I'm going to put it down here at the moment and these particles

1118
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,100
cells will go away because those were from our old experiments,

1119
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:36,900
particle systems.

1120
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,900
And so all we need to do is create one of these.

1121
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,700
I guess this can actually be sort of just created in line with the

1122
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,600
with, with the game mode world.

1123
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:47,600
If we

1124
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,100
it too.

1125
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,800
But it's kind of big so I may want it to be off on its own.

1126
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,800
So I think what I may do is say that in game mode world.

1127
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,700
when things are,

1128
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,800
Getting sort of.

1129
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,500
initializing hear what I may do is say, okay, once we sort of do all

1130
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,800
this initialization, I'm going to also initialize

1131
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,200
Those those particle systems.

1132
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,100
So I'm going to say World mode.

1133
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:19,800
Particle.

1134
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,300
Cash equals, right?

1135
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,400
Oops, push struct cash.

1136
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:32,100
And I don't really want it to clear.

1137
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,600
So I think we want to do that, right?

1138
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,000
And in terms of where we want this to go, we just want this to be in

1139
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,500
our sort of transient storage, right?

1140
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:50,200
Like whatever we're doing as far as our transient State here, we would

1141
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,200
want that Arena.

1142
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,200
So I believe we would just say

1143
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,900
Tran Arena.

1144
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,900
Cuz we don't care what happens to these things, they don't get like

1145
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,400
saved and restored or anything like that.

1146
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,900
So they're not going to be in anything that's supposed to be there.

1147
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:20,400
Yeah.

1148
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,400
That is it a sand on it but other than that I think we're in good

1149
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,300
shape.

1150
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,800
Which functionally in update and render world.

1151
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,500
So, yeah, in here, we just need the world, so I don't know why this

1152
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,100
doesn't why this does World mode Arrow world.

1153
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,800
When that's right up here.

1154
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And I assume it's safe to delete that.

1155
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,100
And leave it that way.

1156
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,600
Yeah, and I think that's it.

1157
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,800
I don't think there's anything else we need to do now, this will not

1158
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:17,300
do anything other than crash if we mess something up but you know like

1159
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:21,200
so but that's pretty much all.

1160
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:27,800
We actually needed to do there, I think, but yeah, not great.

1161
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:32,900
There that was not that was not Stellar to say the least but that's

1162
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:36,500
all the infrastructure that we need for the basic protocol cash I

1163
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,200
think.

1164
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,100
We've got a couple loose ends to tie up there other than the debugging

1165
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,500
which we can do tomorrow.

1166
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,700
Although I'll do one as I'm thinking of it here when we actually

1167
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,800
create one of these particle systems, we did pass a flag that says

1168
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,500
whether we want to create if not found.

1169
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,700
So we probably want to do a check there to say we won't actually

1170
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,700
replace the particle system.

1171
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,800
In the case where

1172
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,100
No, it's not supposed to be.

1173
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:04,900
Done.

1174
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:11,400
Also I would probably do this say to make sure that the index is less

1175
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,700
than system infos go.

1176
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,500
And I think that's about it.

1177
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,100
I'll check temporarily to see.

1178
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,900
Make sure that the

1179
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,300
There isn't an obvious bug for me to fix before.

1180
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,200
Going any further.

1181
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,600
Update render updating render world world mode.

1182
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,700
And Sim.

1183
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:52,200
So I'm not 100% sure why we should have done anything particularly

1184
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,100
Unusual there.

1185
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,500
I will say that this is supposed to be this point.

1186
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:58,300
You should be

1187
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,700
Well no, those are actually fine I guess.

1188
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,600
Those are all fine.

1189
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,800
I'm just going to double check and say well.

1190
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,400
Okay.

1191
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,600
I was thinking through what I might do there for debugging.

1192
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,200
But I also wanted to do since I'm not clearing,

1193
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,600
I wanted to do a in it particle cash.

1194
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:41,600
So again also before I forget I'd like to do a knit protocol cash

1195
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,300
there so I can kind of do just clearing the parts.

1196
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,500
I actually care about because the particle system now is a very large

1197
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,000
block.

1198
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,500
I don't want to bother clearing the whole thing, 20.

1199
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,500
I mean I could but I'm I just don't know that I want to do that

1200
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,600
especially because they'll have to be cleared when they sort of change

1201
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,500
hands anyway.

1202
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
Oh no, I've gone too far over time.

1203
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,400
All right, I really gotta stop.

1204
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:07,700
Sorry.

1205
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:08,700
I just, you know how it is.

1206
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,900
Sometimes you're in the middle of coding.

1207
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:10,500
Something, you're like.

1208
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,000
Well, I just need to finish these few other things.

1209
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,100
All right?

1210
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:18,600
So anyway, if I need the product of cash, all I really wanted to do

1211
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,800
there was kind of go through

1212
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,500
These guys and set the infos.

1213
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,200
To nothing.

1214
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:34,700
That's, that's really all I wanted.

1215
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,100
Was there a null?

1216
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,100
All right.

1217
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,000
Well, so I guess I'm out of time.

1218
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
Unfortunately, I would like to debug this.

1219
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
Cuz I'm sure this is not something particularly.

1220
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:09,000
Hard to debug, but I guess I'm out of time, so I'm not allowed to bug

1221
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,399
it.

1222
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:13,600
Looks like that's an entity.

1223
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,300
That's

1224
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,100
Been borked.

1225
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,500
What if no one saw me to bug it what if they just couldn't tell that I

1226
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:38,300
was out of time and not supposed to be debugging it right now and we

1227
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,600
just didn't tell them that.

1228
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,899
So first thing is first, I just going to go ahead and go

1229
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Like this.

1230
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,300
also, I think I said,

1231
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,300
I was great, except in those there.

1232
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:22,300
And now everything is running.

1233
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,100
With the new code zeroed out.

1234
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:32,800
So next, I will say well, okay, what if we do this

1235
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,300
And what if we do this?

1236
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,500
Explosion.

1237
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,800
So, this is clearly not an acceptable thing to be doing.

1238
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,700
Which, you know I mean what are you going to do?

1239
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,600
Sometimes you just

1240
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,500
Doing some unacceptable stuff.

1241
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,200
So, we have system infos and systems.

1242
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,700
They both have particle systems count worth of things.

1243
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,500
So, you know, I should probably assert that

1244
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,500
But the only thing that does anything, is this operation right here.

1245
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,700
And so if this operation right here is what's happening, that means

1246
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:33,800
that this is being impolite, right?

1247
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:38,400
This is this is fish Ali over writing something, right?

1248
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It's doing something inappropriate and so the question is, how exactly

1249
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,100
could that be doing it?

1250
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:50,000
But at least now that we know that that is what's doing it, it should

1251
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,100
be relatively easy for us to go in and watch it.

1252
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,100
Do it right?

1253
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:58,600
Like we should be able to see that happening and yeah so if we're no

1254
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,800
we're only doing particles.

1255
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,900
Some counts worth of this thing, then it doesn't really seem like that

1256
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,300
should be something that same, but we must have messed up where we

1257
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,100
place it memory or something similar.

1258
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:09,800
Who knows what

1259
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,300
Yeah.

1260
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,600
I also guess I should double-check.

1261
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,500
Well no, I guess I don't.

1262
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,900
So let me take a look here.

1263
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,300
So what are we putting?

1264
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,900
In the Train Arena.

1265
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,300
So I guess I will say that does look like the kind of thing where

1266
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,600
maybe I was being a little bit Hasty there.

1267
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,900
Like I don't know if we're not really using the Train Arena for

1268
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,800
anything at the moment, then maybe I kind of am not.

1269
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,200
You know, I don't know if maybe that was not something that we're

1270
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:01,800
still using.

1271
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,900
I haven't, I haven't looked at that policy in a while, but if it's

1272
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:10,400
being used for temporary memory only there than maybe this should

1273
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,900
actually have been part of the permanent, but I don't really want to

1274
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:19,700
be part of the permit and I feel like in here that should be allowed.

1275
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,500
And so let me take a quick check.

1276
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,500
Yeah, I mean the assets are coming out of there and so on so I feel

1277
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,000
like that's like should have been within the realm of legitimacy.

1278
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,500
So you know I do really feel like that's should be something that's

1279
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,200
happening but I'm almost certain that is what's happening.

1280
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,600
So I guess I just need to be a little bit more.

1281
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,200
Careful about that.

1282
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,700
But here you go.

1283
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,000
Where did my code go?

1284
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,800
So inside here, like I'm pretty sure that what I'm doing is.

1285
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,300
Well, you know, I must be reclaiming this memory which is not what I

1286
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,000
wanted to do.

1287
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,300
And so I'm going to just double-check that.

1288
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,300
I'm right about that.

1289
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,200
All right.

1290
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,300
It's in World mode.

1291
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:31,400
so, what I want to do here is say, alright, let's jump down and we

1292
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,800
allocate the particle cash and then I want to see

1293
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:44,200
The transient Arena and this is like what the size was supposed to be

1294
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,000
at that time, right?

1295
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,200
So when we come out of here, let's see what happens.

1296
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:59,800
We're inside the cutscene renderer and then we switch up to running.

1297
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,500
The world mode which we just switched to.

1298
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,300
And here we come through, there we are.

1299
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,100
Then going to begin temporary memory on the transmitter so that got

1300
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,300
locked in properly.

1301
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,100
So I don't know why that would be a problem.

1302
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,600
That seems totally legitimate to me.

1303
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,300
to be completely honest with you,

1304
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,300
So, it pushes on a Sim region.

1305
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,300
Right.

1306
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,100
And it's using the temporary Arena, so that should have gotten bigger.

1307
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:46,500
Now, of course, I can't really see it because

1308
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,700
visual studio just has no idea where it could possibly be.

1309
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,800
But it didn't.

1310
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,000
Why didn't it?

1311
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,800
Alright, now I'm curious.

1312
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,700
So, there's the size that we're passionate on there.

1313
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,800
It fits, apparently.

1314
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,300
We will not clear it to zero.

1315
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,300
Oh, because I'm looking at the wrong variable.

1316
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,800
I wasn't it sighs.

1317
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,000
I wanted used, ignore everything I just said, don't worry about it.

1318
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,700
So there's my used and

1319
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,500
now, if I look at the correct value,

1320
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,700
it should go up.

1321
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:20,100
So, there we are.

1322
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:27,200
With the memory where we expected to be, which is good.

1323
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:30,300
We push it on and it goes up, which is good.

1324
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,700
We come down through here and we start pushing your raised on here, so

1325
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:40,300
it should go up again and up again, and that's all good.

1326
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:46,200
And so now, when we come through here and do our thing in theory,

1327
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,800
We shouldn't really have any collision between these.

1328
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,400
They're totally non-overlapping as far as I know.

1329
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,000
So let's see.

1330
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,800
So the entities

1331
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,300
Cells are stored in which array here.

1332
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:08,400
So Sim region entities there in this

1333
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:18,100
thing here and so we should be able to see those flags getting like

1334
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,100
romped on I guess.

1335
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:23,400
So I'm going to just go ahead and take this pointer and say I'm going

1336
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,400
to look at this pointer.

1337
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:27,900
As an entity.

1338
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:29,900
And I'm just going to keep on looking as an entity.

1339
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,500
That when we step out of this routine and update those particle

1340
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,000
systems.

1341
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,200
So we come down here to Hoops update, and render particle systems a

1342
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,100
jump down.

1343
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,300
The flags are set to what for

1344
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,300
Okay, see what happens.

1345
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,200
Nothing.

1346
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,800
It wasn't to do 0, right?

1347
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,600
Second, double check.

1348
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,200
And let's also take a look at what these pointers are.

1349
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:23,600
Like are we anywhere close and we really aren't like, we're not going

1350
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:24,300
to hit it.

1351
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,500
I don't think.

1352
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,700
So that didn't get touched right?

1353
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,000
Then we come through and Sam.

1354
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,800
Okay, so it doesn't happen on the first frame.

1355
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:04,200
Bam.

1356
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
That is our problem right there.

1357
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,400
So well, that makes it really easy to fix I suppose, but that is kind

1358
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,500
of an annoying problem, right?

1359
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:23,300
That definitely makes it sound to me like the transient Arena concept,

1360
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:29,200
really just should be done at this level because, you know, you can't

1361
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,800
be, I don't know if you can see what happened there.

1362
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,700
So the fact that this doesn't begin temporary memory with this Arena

1363
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,600
means that when we end the temporary memory down,

1364
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,800
Here are the allocation that we did will go away, right?

1365
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,300
Which is not what we want.

1366
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,500
So yeah, I mean, this is a problem.

1367
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,600
One of the ways that things that we do on handmade hero, that's not

1368
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,500
particularly great.

1369
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:56,600
Is we keep the, we don't really have much in the way of Arenas.

1370
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,700
What I typically do is

1371
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,900
Usually have an arena per thread for temp, stuff and an arena /, like

1372
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,800
thing, that's active.

1373
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,600
So there's a lot less Arenas on handmade hero than probably.

1374
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,800
I would normally use and it really doesn't get much of an issue

1375
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:19,600
because there isn't that many reasons why it would, but you can see in

1376
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,400
this circumstance where it kind of is because it's like well at this

1377
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,200
point you wish you had a little more flexibility there because it's

1378
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:29,300
not like we need to be that conservative with how many of these things

1379
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:29,900
we have.

1380
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,100
Have but we then sort of run into these problems where it's like,

1381
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,200
okay, you know, that was kind of a stupid bug that you don't really

1382
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,400
need to have as only because you're kind of being more restricted with

1383
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,600
these regions than you need to be which you know if we were trying to

1384
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,300
Target an Atari 2600 or something.

1385
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,300
Well, forget that if you're trying to Target a Converse T4, and we

1386
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,800
needed all of our memory W laid out exactly, that way, maybe that

1387
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,200
makes some sense but that's not actually what we're doing at all.

1388
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,300
And so,

1389
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:01,000
Yeah, it's just kind of a necessary that point.

1390
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:03,000
So I guess what I would say is,

1391
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,400
I guess what I would say is the world.

1392
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,600
Where is the actual game mode?

1393
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,200
So I would say that the mode arena is really the arena, you know, or

1394
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,000
rather the something that the tracks with the game mode is where the

1395
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,200
particle systems, really more belonged to a certain extent.

1396
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,300
Right?

1397
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,300
And so I don't know.

1398
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,200
You know, these things really I think want to be a little more

1399
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,900
formalized here and I don't know to what extent this ever really wants

1400
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,900
to be used.

1401
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,500
You can see that.

1402
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,800
It's kind of largely.

1403
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,000
Kind of residual there in handmade dot CPP where it's going to use.

1404
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,400
But I feel like there's just a lot of risk there because now people

1405
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,800
can't really use that transient arena in that way.

1406
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:17,200
But anyway, so I don't know if motorino would be appropriate here if

1407
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:23,700
we actually do use mode arena in that way, then it probably is right

1408
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,300
where we push on that that stuff.

1409
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,900
But I don't know how much space we expect to give.

1410
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,400
Normally.

1411
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,000
so it looks like it takes

1412
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:47,300
pretty much all the rest of the permanent storage size.

1413
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,300
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and add this here.

1414
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,400
I think we may change this from particle system week to Arena week

1415
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:19,000
because I don't really, I don't like the way that is and I think I had

1416
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:19,500
it on.

1417
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,800
I had had it on the list for a while to do like to show how to make

1418
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,700
those things grow dynamically as well.

1419
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,700
So you wouldn't have to worry about saying how much memory you're

1420
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:32,700
going to use ahead of time if you didn't want to, since there's a lot

1421
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,400
of circumstances and programming nowadays where you don't really have

1422
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,000
to care.

1423
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,100
You know, you have for all intents and purposes like an infinite

1424
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:39,700
amount of memory.

1425
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,100
The key is just to not use

1426
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,100
Improperly.

1427
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,900
And so, what you're really more concerned about is the pattern in

1428
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:50,100
which you use it and not the amount you use, Etc.

1429
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,000
And that's, you can actually use the exact same stuff that we use on

1430
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,300
handmade hero, but just if you do some slight modifications to it, you

1431
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,600
can just have them grow so it's not really any more constructive.

1432
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,000
So I wanted to show how to add that as well, since it's such an easy

1433
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:04,500
add-on.

1434
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:10,900
So yeah, rather than do anything complicated to fix that tonight

1435
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:11,100
though.

1436
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:14,100
I'll just say that we can probably add

1437
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,600
The motor Arena as the place to allocate from and we'll take a look at

1438
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,100
that in more detail tomorrow.

1439
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,000
But yeah.

1440
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:31,100
Yeah, so now we're I think out of size on this guy, right?

1441
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:35,700
Because this guy is really big and Lorena can't can't fit him.

1442
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,800
But that's actually okay.

1443
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,700
We can fix that until tomorrow as well.

1444
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,000
We're not.

1445
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,500
Does this guy?

1446
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,200
Well actually, I guess the other thing is, does this guy take all the

1447
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,200
room in this Arena?

1448
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,300
I don't actually know.

1449
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,200
Probably.

1450
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,700
What I can do that.

1451
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:13,100
Is just this.

1452
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,200
So yeah.

1453
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:27,000
So that's fine now but I don't like having that potential for a

1454
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,500
lurking bug there for those sorts of real things.

1455
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:33,600
So I might want to just take some time this week to go through and

1456
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,500
just like pull out the arena system into something and then finish it

1457
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,800
up like add the few things are going to add to it and that way we can

1458
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:43,400
clean those up a little bit and not have them be things that might be

1459
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,200
kind of overly obtuse, but yeah.

1460
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,000
Well, that wasn't too bad to debug, but I definitely wasn't supposed

1461
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,900
to go that long.

1462
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,500
So I apologize for the length.

1463
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:54,800
Enos.

1464
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,400
We were 15 minutes overtime.

1465
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,900
I will do brief Q&A.

1466
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,800
If you guys want to, if you have any questions,

1467
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,100
Chris, I think you should be searching for Max famous in such know

1468
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,900
you're right.

1469
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,700
Yes, I would agree with that.

1470
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:41,400
Actually

1471
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,900
Why I closed everything down.

1472
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:52,800
Yes, you're correct because Min frame since touched.

1473
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,400
I actually want the oldest.

1474
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:57,400
Right?

1475
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,800
And that makes it so I don't need, I just still wouldn't have needed

1476
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:01,800
you three to maximum.

1477
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,700
yeah, I agree with that because if the, if it goes up every time that

1478
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,000
I want, the one that's been around the longest,

1479
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:22,000
Jean, Victor.

1480
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,700
So was the problem that the transit memory vaporize per frame while

1481
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,200
the product class you say cross arm?

1482
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,700
Yes, the problem was just that the transient Arena, it's not only that

1483
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:34,700
it vanishes per frame, it's that people in general we're just using it

1484
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,700
as temporary memory so they do begin and end temps around it.

1485
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:44,300
So when things inside there want to allocate from, it won't work,

1486
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:44,800
right?

1487
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,000
Because whatever they do, they're not going to

1488
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,100
It's not going to persist.

1489
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:56,900
And so since the mode was getting created inside of someone else's

1490
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,900
render Loop, now granted we probably shouldn't be doing that.

1491
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:04,300
Like, you know, it's not like that was really a good thing to happen.

1492
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,800
So, you know, if you take a look at what's going on in this code, that

1493
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,400
did the actual transition, I don't really remember where that was

1494
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,400
probably in here.

1495
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,500
what was it that we were looking at there, it was

1496
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,300
I don't quite remember.

1497
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,200
Probably would have been in here.

1498
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:42,600
Oops.

1499
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,300
Yeah, it was this.

1500
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,500
So if you look at what happens here, you know, we begin the temporary

1501
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,300
memory memory for rendering, we do the rendering and then we release

1502
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,100
the temporary memory.

1503
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,100
So, you know, it makes some sense because it means that we're doing

1504
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:10,100
sort of these were sort of encapsulating or sorry blocking out the

1505
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:13,400
render to make sure that all the rendering that gets used is not going

1506
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,700
to go away.

1507
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:18,100
But you know, it's unclear that you really want that to be going in

1508
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:18,700
the Train Arena.

1509
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,800
When these people might be using that train arena for something or

1510
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,500
blow, you know, it's, it's it's kind of again, it's just unclear when

1511
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,800
you have this concept of the transient State and who that belongs to.

1512
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,900
So I just would like to

1513
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,600
Kind of clean that out and say, okay, let's actually have people talk

1514
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,000
about Arenas more clearly where it's like, here is the memory that's

1515
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,800
being used for this.

1516
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,500
And, you know, here is the memory that's being used for this.

1517
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,700
And we kind of know whose is whose, and when these things change and

1518
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:48,500
so that it's like lighter weight to just have Arenas that we don't

1519
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,300
know what their size are.

1520
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,400
So that we don't really have to care about that.

1521
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:55,300
If we don't want to, we can just say, hey, will we make sure we never

1522
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,300
use more than 4 gigabytes, but we don't have to pre parcel out.

1523
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,800
Who gets how much of which

1524
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,700
At least, not at this stage.

1525
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,800
Storing tortoise.

1526
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,200
Not sure if this has been answered on a previous stream still trying

1527
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,000
to catch up.

1528
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,300
Would you introduce the threading model?

1529
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,600
You mentioned that we would want one thread per core but since the OS

1530
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,800
creates threads for us, so helpful for things like audio, does it

1531
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,400
matter that we end up with more threads than cores?

1532
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,800
Well, the the answer to that is, it would be great if the operating

1533
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:38,700
system was written in a way that was good and on Windows, obviously,

1534
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,200
it's not.

1535
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,200
So there's nothing you can do about that.

1536
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,800
So there is no way to really make it.

1537
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,500
That you actually get one thread per core which is what you want

1538
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,300
because like you say the opposite will create more however just

1539
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,500
because the operating system will come in and steal time from you when

1540
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,800
when you even though, you didn't want it to by swapping in other

1541
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:01,700
threads that were probably Superfluous and unnecessary, that doesn't

1542
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:05,200
mean that you don't want to make sure you're not doing that as well.

1543
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,900
Look, you don't want to make a bad situation worse by having more

1544
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:10,500
threads

1545
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,200
Then there are cores in your game, right?

1546
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:18,300
You still want to, if you can make it so that your well-balanced and,

1547
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:21,400
yes, unfortunately, you will have to live with the fact that the

1548
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,300
operating system is going to steal time for you by swapping in these

1549
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,300
other threads that have has.

1550
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,500
But there's nothing you can do about it.

1551
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:35,100
If you want, you can try to cross your fingers and hope that maybe the

1552
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:40,000
operating system would always just sit on one core and then you can

1553
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,500
like use all the cores

1554
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,000
But one and then be perfectly balanced.

1555
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,200
But in reality, it's unclear that that's actually better because

1556
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,200
chances are the operating system is going to come in sporadically on

1557
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,100
any of the Coors.

1558
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,500
And even if it was only coming in sporadically on a single core, it

1559
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,600
might not use the entire frame time, in which case you still want,

1560
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,800
jobs to be able to execute on that core.

1561
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:05,300
So typically the way I usually look at it is you want to go ahead and

1562
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:09,400
take one thread per core and have the operations of know that you have

1563
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,300
one thread per core.

1564
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,400
Please keep it that way.

1565
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:14,700
So that your maximum efficient and then whatever the operating comes

1566
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:18,300
up and comes in, okay, you lose some work on that core when it decides

1567
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:19,200
to but that's okay.

1568
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:41,600
And by the way, CH I been the answer is, yes, I no longer use emacs.

1569
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,400
I use for a coder for everything on stream and off stream.

1570
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,900
Now it is the edit the only text editor that I use now,

1571
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And it is so much better than emacs at this point.

1572
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,100
It's kind of hard to compare the two, like it's not a little bit

1573
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,400
better than my emacs was.

1574
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,800
It's like 10 times better than my emacs was.

1575
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,500
Like especially some of these new features that you can do like this

1576
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,400
stuff where I can search for something and have it.

1577
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,700
It immediately tell me where everything is like emacs.

1578
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,300
You have to remember like I'm coming from emacs.

1579
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,800
It's like one of the most Antiquated editors of this point, right?

1580
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:25,000
So, I'm not coming from something modern like Sublime, which might

1581
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,600
have some more reasonable features.

1582
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:33,200
I'm coming from emacs and emacs's is really pretty broken and very,

1583
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:33,900
very slow.

1584
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,000
And so now like that query

1585
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:39,400
It would have taken many seconds on emacs because it would have had to

1586
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:39,800
spun up.

1587
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,500
A fine, stir run the fine, stir capture the output do the thing for

1588
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,900
coder, allows me to just write code that lets keep loads all my stuff

1589
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:52,000
in memory and now I can just do a quick query and do that and, you

1590
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
know, I could have done all that stuff in e-list but oh my God,

1591
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,200
programming Annie list by never did it because was awful.

1592
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:03,700
And so for coders much better now I made my own like project thing so

1593
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:06,800
now everything can be loaded in memory and so now like old things that

1594
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,900
used to be like a grep of files are now just searching for in memory

1595
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:14,400
stuff because I could implement the project stuff that I want and so I

1596
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,800
know that all my files are always loaded in the editor and stuff like

1597
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,600
that, right?

1598
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:23,100
The other thing that I printed out for a coder is for many many years

1599
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:29,000
and in fact that even sent Alan when he when he, you know, I did

1600
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,600
Even request this feature, it was just something he had mentioned.

1601
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,600
He might want to work on and when I heard him say he wanted to work on

1602
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:35,900
it.

1603
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,200
I sent him this email to thread that was like, a decade old or more.

1604
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:43,500
When emacs first at its off returns, I was like

1605
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:50,000
I really wish you know, Emax would add the ability to automatically

1606
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,300
flow text because if you think about it, like when you open up a word

1607
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:59,800
processor, you don't have to like manually line wrapped

1608
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,800
Lines, right?

1609
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:06,200
Like you don't have to indent the first thing of a paragraph and then

1610
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:11,000
like manually Reflow your paragraphs to like line them up, right?

1611
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:15,400
But literally, no editor, no matter how modern that I've ever seen for

1612
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,100
code.

1613
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,000
Does the indenting automatically, right?

1614
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,500
It should.

1615
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:27,100
So, for example, there is no known editor that I know of, that will

1616
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:29,700
take parentheticals like this.

1617
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,100
And as I type, if I deleted that just wrap the other two up

1618
01:36:34,100 --> 01:36:38,100
automatically to it right or and then if I put it back in flow them

1619
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:39,500
back around, right?

1620
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:42,300
But that's how word processors have worked for Generations.

1621
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,800
And so I've always wanted that feature and right now Alan is actually

1622
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,500
working on that in for a coder.

1623
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:55,000
And if he ships the version of for coder that has that working in it.

1624
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,100
I think that will completely revolutionize, code editing.

1625
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:05,100
I mean, it would save so much busy work to never have to worry about

1626
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:09,900
inserting returns and fussing around with, like the white space in

1627
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:10,700
your code.

1628
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,100
Like it's such a pain in the butt.

1629
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:17,300
All the time and yet it's great that you know, for a coder already and

1630
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:20,500
all modern text editors have the ability to Auto indent your code when

1631
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,300
you tell it.

1632
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:25,600
But why am I even ever telling it that and why am I ever even having

1633
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,100
to decide how long a line is, what if I've got two different machines

1634
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:35,000
that have different sized monitors, I want to see the line go as long

1635
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,300
as the line can go and then wrap.

1636
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:42,100
If it has to wrap, I don't want you to force me to pre decide.

1637
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:42,900
How many

1638
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,200
Columns, my code is when that's completely irrelevant to the code,

1639
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:48,700
right?

1640
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,500
So when that features in for coder, which I guess baby, as soon as the

1641
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,400
next version because Allen's got a lot of it working, he was demoing

1642
01:37:56,400 --> 01:38:02,600
it this morning actually more this afternoon when that feature is in,

1643
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:06,000
I'm kind of thinking for coders almost a must-have, I can't imagine

1644
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,000
doing editing without that.

1645
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,500
Once you have it, it's such an obvious win.

1646
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,100
I've wanted it for ever.

1647
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:15,500
No text editor, has ever delivered it or even come close that I've

1648
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:16,000
seen.

1649
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,300
And so if he, if he delivers that I think

1650
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,000
All over.

1651
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,700
Like either all the other editors have to add it or you have two or if

1652
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,800
you're not on for code or I don't know what to tell you, you're just,

1653
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,400
you're, you're a chump, sorry, you know.

1654
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,800
So that's going to be kind of amazing if that happens.

1655
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,300
We'll see.

1656
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:37,400
Not to mention all of the editing features that can come from that.

1657
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,100
Like then you can just do stuff like.

1658
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:42,100
Okay, I no longer have to worry about where I am on my white space

1659
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:46,100
like I no longer have to worry when I cut and pasted this thing that

1660
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,100
you know, I'm cutting pasting from the right place on the space or

1661
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,600
something because I constantly am doing fiddly things like this to get

1662
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:53,200
in there.

1663
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,700
If you start to virtualize the white space which is what islands doing

1664
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,800
you can imagine all these other edit things where it's just like, oh,

1665
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,900
Now, it doesn't.

1666
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,300
There isn't this isn't here anymore, right?

1667
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,500
It's like I don't have to tell you.

1668
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,600
Oh, I got a cut between like, you know, this part of the white space

1669
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,800
and this other part of the white.

1670
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:16,600
So it's like just to give a simple example, right?

1671
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,900
If I were to say

1672
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,800
Cut this out like this right?

1673
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,300
And then paste it in here.

1674
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,200
There's an extra piece of white space there but that's completely

1675
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:27,900
irrelevant.

1676
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:32,500
Like there's no reason that I would ever have to tell it that that

1677
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,400
that was true.

1678
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:37,600
Like it could just know to not put in more white space there, right?

1679
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,300
And so, there's all these other edit features.

1680
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:42,700
You could imagine that start to get level up from there as well.

1681
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:47,500
So I think the further he goes down that path, the more indispensable

1682
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,700
for a coder actually would be to become

1683
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,500
As all of that is busy work.

1684
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:55,400
None of it has anything to do with your code, like, none of the

1685
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,800
layout, you see on the screen right now has anything to do with

1686
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,400
anything.

1687
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:03,000
It could have been automatically done 100% by a pretty printing

1688
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,700
program.

1689
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:09,000
And so the fact that I spend time at all in a text editor, entering,

1690
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,800
any of it is obviously wasted.

1691
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,800
And so I think the more that for Carter takes over that, the more it

1692
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,700
would be silly to try and edit in anything else because

1693
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,000
Now, you're just wasting tons of time on stuff that for coder will

1694
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,500
just do for you, you know?

1695
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:26,900
so,

1696
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,500
all right, I'm going to go because I got to go to bed.

1697
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,600
All right, I'm going to wrap it up.

1698
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:28,000
Thank you everyone for joining me for this episode of handmade here

1699
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:28,100
at.

1700
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:29,000
So, I put a recording with you.

1701
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:29,600
As always.

1702
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,900
If you would like to follow along with the series, you can always

1703
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,700
pre-order the game on handmade here at work.

1704
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,900
It comes with a source code so you can follow along at home.

1705
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,700
We have a forum site.

1706
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:42,300
You go to if yet when asked questions we have a patreon page, you can

1707
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,200
go to if you want to support the video series and we have a schedule,

1708
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:46,100
but you can go to.

1709
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,400
If you would like to know when the series going to be live, we also

1710
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,200
have an episode guide, you can go to if you want to catch up on old

1711
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:55,200
episodes and of course a countdown timer.

1712
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:59,000
You can always refresh to see when we're going to be live next.

1713
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,400
If that's easier for you, that's about it for today.

1714
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,100
I'll be back here tomorrow, same time, same place, until then, have

1715
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,500
fun programming, and I'll see you guys on the internet.

1716
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:09,200
Take it easy, everyone.
