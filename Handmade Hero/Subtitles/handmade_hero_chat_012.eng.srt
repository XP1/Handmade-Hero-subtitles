00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,800
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,600
The show Rico to complete game live on stream in the pre stream.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,400
We had a question and I thought it was a question that probably a lot

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,800
of people ask a lot.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,200
I see it's kind of talked about it on the internet and it's something

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,800
that I feel like probably should be addressed it and it's actually

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
fairly topical I suppose at this point in time.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,600
So I figured I would actually put the answer on the stream for reals

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,600
and the question was

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,700
I'll just read it again.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,200
Exactly.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
As it was written.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,100
The question was, I'm a student struggling with imposter syndrome?

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,600
I feel like I can't do anything and everyone is better than me.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,200
Your thoughts on this phenomenon and I guess there's a lot of things

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,600
to think about in that sort of wrapped up in this question, I'll start

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,500
with the fact that impostor syndrome was something that I had never

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,000
heard about until a few years ago, actually, when I was growing up and

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
when I was starting out in the game industry,

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,099
Stree.

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,400
And for most of my career in the game industry, I never heard that

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,900
term.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,400
So it's only fairly recently that I think that you know, that the

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,500
general programming population was aware of this as a thing to give a

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,700
name to write, which is not the same as saying that it's a recent

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
phenomenon, right?

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,500
The phenomenon has probably been going on in terms of the feelings

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
that people have surrounding, this has maybe gone on forever, who

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,900
knows?

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,600
But

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,500
It wasn't like I never heard anyone discuss it or even like know, you

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,900
know, didn't like have a name for that and you may not have liked

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,900
associated with like a group of people who have this or known that you

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,300
had it or even thought to yourself.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,000
Do I have this thing right?

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,900
And so you know I feel like part of probably a little bit of of the

37
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,100
the benefit to having gone, you know, grown up during that time period

38
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,600
is I will say before I say anything else about it.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,500
Imposter syndrome, I will say that.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Once someone puts the thought in your head that this is a thing, you

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,600
may be more likely to get, you know, hung up on it too, right?

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,700
It's like, if you've never heard about problem X and maybe you have

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,500
problem X, you might be just okay?

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,700
Ignoring it because you never really thought of it and you don't, you

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800
know, have concrete thoughts about it or whatever like that.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,400
So, you know, I think maybe we got some benefit in never having anyone

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,600
talk about this thing, you know, it might make it easier,

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,400
Move past, but either, or I think the feelings are definitely genuine

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,200
and probably have happened throughout programming history and probably

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
throughout anything history.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
And I think there's a couple things to think about when you think

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
about impostor syndrome, right?

53
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,700
So first of all, there is actually a legitimate question for everyone,

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,700
which is Mia, any good at this thing, right?

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,700
It is important to try and figure that out to a certain degree, right?

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,000
It is important to be aware of the fact that you can just be very bad

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,700
at something.

58
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,400
Right?

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,500
And, you know, I certainly have things at least that I've experienced

60
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,000
in my life where I like, I'm pretty sure that like, whatever this

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
thing is, you know, I'm doing this thing.

62
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm like, I can kind of tell that I'm probably always going to be

63
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,900
really bad at this thing, right?

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,800
For example, if my goal in life was to be a long distance Runner, I

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
can pretty much tell you that there would be

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Problem with imposter syndrome, it would just be regular.

67
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm really bad at this syndrome because I am going to be really bad at

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,000
it, right?

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,000
And no matter how hard I worked at being a long distance.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Runner, I'm never going to be one of the top long-distance Runners,

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,300
like that's just not going to happen, right?

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,400
And probably, I won't even be one of the like, okay, long distance

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Runners.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,900
I'm probably just going to be bad, like, period, like just pretty much

75
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,800
bad even if I was in best condition for me, right?

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,500
It's just, it's not, maybe my genetics to be good at this thing.

77
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,000
It's me.

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,600
Be not, you know, my lifestyle, or how I conduct myself, you know, in

79
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
terms of physical fitness, who knows?

80
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,600
Right.

81
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I have no idea, but it's pretty clear that it's not going to happen.

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,500
And so it is definitely true.

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,600
That it a certain level, you do want to be aware, you want to be

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,500
self-aware and go Mi pursuing a course that is definitely going to be

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,300
too difficult for me to ever achieve the level of proficiency that I

86
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,600
want, right.

87
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
And it's important to put it into those terms right?

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,600
Because if I just wanted to do long distance running for fun and I

89
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
didn't really care how good I was at it.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I just wanted to do it then it doesn't matter so much, right?

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
In other words, it always has to be about

92
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,900
Particular goal because, you know, if your goal isn't to be great at

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,100
something, if your goal is just to have fun, then why are you even

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,500
talking about a positive as the goal is to have fun, right?

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
And the same can be said of something like programming.

96
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,000
If your goal is to just you enjoy programming and you're, you know,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,600
you just want to do it for a living and you don't care.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,500
If you're one of the worst people at it, as long as you still can just

99
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
main keep a job, right?

100
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,200
That's a much lower bar, then I want to excel at programming, right?

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,100
Furthermore, you could just be a programming

102
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,800
A hobbyist.

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
I just want to do this as a hobby for fun, right?

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,400
And then the bar is lower, still, it doesn't matter if your program

105
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,000
has ever even work.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,200
As long as you're enjoying it, that's okay, right?

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,100
And so certainly, it's worth recognizing that as well.

108
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,800
But assuming that it's something that you're saying, you know, this is

109
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
something I want to spend a significant amount my life on.

110
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,000
I care whether I am good at it or not, so you've already made that

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
decision, right?

112
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,900
And again it's important to actually get there, don't just assume that

113
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,800
because do you really know that's the important thing in your life,

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,100
right?

115
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Do you have you actually sat down and

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,700
Right.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,300
Is it important to me that I am a good programmer, right?

118
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Because it may not be right.

119
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,900
That is that is it is not, you know, it's easy to fall into the Trap.

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
You know, on the internet where everyone's yelling about

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,700
How great they are templates or whatever is going on over there.

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
And did you get in the IPO?

123
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,100
And who knows what's happening, right?

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,200
It's easy to think that your self-worth is going to be tied up in how

125
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
good of a programmer you are or something like that, right?

126
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,100
But don't let that happen to you without actually establishing that

127
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,300
yourself like you should actually get there yourself and decide, I do

128
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,800
care about being a good programmer, it's not just a psychological

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,000
thing.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
That's happened to me that I let the world kind of push on me, that

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:29,900
that was

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,700
Important.

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,200
I actually got to put where it's important to me, right?

134
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,400
Because if you don't get there, you're if you're not there then you

135
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
again shouldn't care about imposter syndrome at all.

136
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,500
If it really isn't important to you, like like inside that you are a

137
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,600
good programmer, then you shouldn't care at all.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
The only thing you care about is, is, you know, am I getting hired for

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,100
a job?

140
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
So, I can support myself, right?

141
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,600
That's the only bar, you have to clear and it doesn't matter if you're

142
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,600
awful at it or whether you feel like you're off lot at.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,400
None of that matters.

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
If you, if you don't care, then all you have to do.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Just don't worry about it.

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
You're it's just a job, right?

147
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,200
It's like going to any other job.

148
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,100
If you didn't care about whatever it was, you were doing you don't

149
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,900
care how good you are, as long as the boss is happy, right?

150
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,700
So you got to get there yourself, and if you get there yourself,

151
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,600
you're like, it's important to me that I'm good at this thing, right?

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Then we get into the question of sort of more The Imposter syndrome

153
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,700
stuff, right?

154
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,900
And for those of you who aren't familiar with this phrase, I'm

155
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,100
assuming like, everyone is at this point, but like I said, it was kind

156
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,800
of a new word.

157
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,700
To me, what is essentially describes as far as I am understanding it

158
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,500
from the way.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,100
I see it used is, it's the feeling that you get when you are in a

160
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,500
position where you're expected to do something, whatever that thing is

161
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,800
and you feel like you are not good enough to do that thing and

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,700
everyone around, you just doesn't like know that yet or that they are

163
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,900
good at this thing and you're not and you're going to be like found

164
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,100
out.

165
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,800
It's like literally

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,700
Imposter part.

167
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,300
It's like you believe you are just fronting the fact that you are good

168
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,200
at programming.

169
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,000
But actually you're bad at programming and it's just a matter of time

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,100
perhaps till everyone finds out, right?

171
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,800
It's literally, like, you know, kind of Taken literally, I am not a

172
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
pop psychologist.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So, you know, don't listen to me for a textbook definition of this

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,300
phrase.

175
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,700
That's just my understanding of kind of like how people tend to use it

176
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,100
and the kinds of things I describe when they attach it to that term.

177
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,299
So the question is, let's say, you are in a position where you care

178
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,900
about being good.

179
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,100
Programmer, you want to do programming for living, and your self-worth

180
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,799
is tied to this.

181
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,799
In some way, you care about.

182
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,900
Whether you excel at this.

183
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,900
It's a self-esteem issue for you, right?

184
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Which is totally fair.

185
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,500
You know, I definitely want to be good at programming.

186
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,600
I do it all the time.

187
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,100
I don't want to feel like I'm bad at programming, right?

188
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,200
That's not a thing that I want to feel etcetera, etcetera, right?

189
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,900
so, if you've gotten to that point then,

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,800
I think there's some things that you have to, you know, start to

191
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,300
internalize and it's kind of difficult, but it gets to part of the

192
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,900
reason why I do handmade hero as well, right?

193
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,700
And that is you have to understand first of all that most programmers

194
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,500
are not as good at programming, as you probably think they are right.

195
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,900
People who are looking outward and having these thoughts about like, a

196
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,100
my, you know, I'm not really good at this.

197
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
And everyone else is good at this or something.

198
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,600
You are probably over perceiving like or overvaluing, I don't know

199
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,100
what's wrong.

200
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,500
You're probably looking at other programmers and evaluating their

201
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
skills higher than you should right.

202
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,400
And again that's one of the reasons that I do handmade hero the way I

203
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,200
do it because one way that I could have done, handmade here is do a

204
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,900
lot of preparation for it and then do a stream where I didn't really

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,600
make any mistakes and everything came out, really perfect.

206
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,800
And you know there,

207
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,500
Bugs and stuff, right?

208
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,200
That would have been one way to do it and that would be an interesting

209
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,400
way to do it if what you're trying to do is just show typing in,

210
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,000
correct?

211
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
Code, or something, right?

212
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,700
But I don't think that's particularly useful, especially not to people

213
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,500
who are just learning.

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,400
And the reason for that is because it is very much tied into the

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,500
Imposter syndrome thing.

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,300
I never think about imposter syndrome because like I said, that was it

217
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,200
something that I grew up with as a thing?

218
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,000
But I just do.

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I do think that the way we've traditionally taught programming where

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,100
it's in books with pre-written code that's been like, pre-tested, you

221
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,700
know, and worked on.

222
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,700
And then, we just saw the results, we write blog posts that are like,

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,400
here are the results of this law.

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,100
Process.

225
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,800
And here's where we ended up, right?

226
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,500
I think what those things do is they accidentally, right?

227
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,600
They're not trying to do this, but they accidentally make it appear as

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,700
if great programmers, just have the answer and they just stick it into

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,100
the like editor and then, there it is, right.

230
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,300
But having worked with plenty of great programmers.

231
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,000
I can tell you for a fact that that is nothing to do with it, right?

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,700
It is nowhere like that at all.

233
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't care.

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,200
Which

235
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,200
Programmer you care to name, trust me?

236
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,300
That's not how it worked.

237
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,900
And so what I wanted to show on handmade hero was an example of

238
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,300
somebody who does program for a living and gets paid to do it.

239
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,600
Right.

240
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,900
So, you know that they're, you know, someone who you could go do this

241
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,300
thing, if you want to do this thing, and you would be reasonably

242
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
successful if you did it like they did it.

243
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,600
Showing me programming and making tons of mistakes, right?

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,300
And having to go through lots of iterations, right?

245
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,400
So, even if you're not talking about mistakes changing your mind, a

246
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,900
bunch having to re move code around, change the way I do things.

247
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Get stuck on bugs, right?

248
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,900
The reason I do that is very specifically because I want younger

249
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
programmers, who don't?

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,100
I have the experience of working with people like I did, right?

251
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,500
Because, like I said, working with great programmers, lets you see

252
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,100
that they have these problems, I wanted them to see

253
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,400
That people who work in this industry day-to-day on code that ships

254
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,600
and lots of games have all of these same problems that they're having,

255
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,200
right?

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,800
Because that is crucial in my opinion to understanding the development

257
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,900
process, right?

258
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Even if imposter syndrome and worrying about the psychological effect

259
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,100
of that isn't the primary question that we were asking.

260
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
Like that is the question that I'm addressing now but even if it

261
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,200
wasn't it's just a question of being

262
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,800
Good developer, right?

263
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,700
A good developer has to internalize the fact that this is the way

264
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,900
development works, there isn't such a thing as someone who can just

265
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
come in and write the perfect code for you.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,300
The first time, the only time that you can ever do that is if you've

267
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,000
already written exactly that code before and occasionally, you'll see

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that on handmade hero.

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,300
Sometimes, I write something you'll see me do it on handmade here and

270
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,900
it comes out.

271
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,500
It's like, how did he do that so quickly or something?

272
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,400
I've heard people ask me this about certain parts.

273
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
When I've done them and the answer is always the same.

274
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,300
The reason, the only reason you will ever see me, do something

275
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,700
flawlessly on handmade hero is because it's something I've done so

276
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300
many times before, right?

277
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,000
And anything that I haven't done enough times before or don't have a

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,600
good solution for yet that I've been satisfied with in the past it

279
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
goes through all those same problems, right?

280
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,000
I have all of those same problems that a beginner programmer would

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,800
have and maybe I have better attack skills because I have so much more

282
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
experience than being a programmer but

283
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Of the same problems, apply I get bugs that I didn't, you know, c4c, I

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,100
have mistakes that I make and how I architected something that means I

285
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,800
have to sort of change it around again.

286
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,200
I have to do some exploration right?

287
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,300
Because I'm not sure I think maybe this is the right thing, but then

288
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
it turns out to not be.

289
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,400
I make a mistake that cost some performance and only through the

290
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:04,900
profiling.

291
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,700
Do I determine that?

292
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
I've made an error somewhere and I have to go change the way I was

293
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,000
storing.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Something all of those same things.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,600
Apply.

296
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You know, and I've been programming for 30 years, right.

297
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,200
So I think it's critical that people see that and they see that

298
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,400
programmer programming is about having is about that process.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,600
And very recently, actually back onto the Imposter syndrome part, I

300
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,900
was talking with a programmer, who's, you know, unquestionably a great

301
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,800
programmer, right?

302
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
There's just no question about this and I won't say who it was because

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,100
this was in a private conversation by, so I can someone who was

304
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,600
unquestionably, like from my perspective, a great programmer, right?

305
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,900
And they

306
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,500
We are in the midst of a project that they were just feeling really

307
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,800
bad about the state of the project because, you know, they felt like

308
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
they had kind of bitten off more than they could chew.

309
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,700
And then it was making, you know, creating problematic costs for their

310
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,500
company and what they were doing and like, they just, you know, they

311
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,600
wanted to do a really good job on it, but the cost of doing the really

312
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
good job, or just a lot, right?

313
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,100
And all these sorts of things.

314
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,000
And it's like,

315
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,900
It is literally the case that no matter how long you program.

316
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,000
If you're trying to do something new or you're trying to do something

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,600
difficult and your trunk, you know if you're trying to go beyond where

318
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,500
you are right now, it doesn't matter how good of a programmer you are.

319
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,000
It is just, that is the process.

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,100
The process is about going through those things and making the

321
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,100
mistakes and keeping at it and at the end of the day, what typically

322
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,200
differentiates, you know, the programmers, who make it from the

323
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,100
programmers, who don't in these when you're

324
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,900
Talking about difficulties.

325
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,500
That is, it's really about that perseverance, right?

326
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,600
It's about how you recover from the mistakes, how you move past, you

327
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,900
know, your shortcomings, how you kind of get past that not about never

328
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,600
having them because programming is so complicated that I've just never

329
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,700
seen anyone ever get to the point where they're not wrestling with all

330
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,600
of those issues.

331
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,200
So, I think when you're first starting out,

332
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,300
You should absolutely expect to have all of those sorts of problems

333
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,800
because, you know, that even people who are much more experienced than

334
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,600
you are, and who are shipping high-profile games, and all these are

335
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,500
sites are having those problems to write.

336
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
And so, it really doesn't matter.

337
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Where on the Spectrum you fall in less, you aren't challenging

338
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,500
yourself, like, unless you're intentionally picking code of a size and

339
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,000
a nature.

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,700
That is beneath your skill level at this point.

341
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,300
You will go through these same problems, right?

342
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,900
So that's and I think that's very important to internalize is that not

343
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,099
only do great programmers, make mistakes, they make horrible mistakes,

344
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,099
they make really bad decisions about their projects, they get things

345
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:16,900
pretty deep into the hole right and eventually they will pull

346
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,800
themselves back out of that but it's a definitely a fallacy to assume

347
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,800
that just because it's some famous person that you look up to that.

348
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,700
That person doesn't have that those exact same

349
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,100
Mmmmm days where they're thinking to themselves, oh my God, like I

350
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,800
can't do this, I've screwed everything up, what am I going to do?

351
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
This is never going to work, right?

352
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,300
That's just part of the psychology.

353
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,700
Okay, so I'd say, keep keep that in mind for the rest of the session.

354
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,700
So the next thing I would say is well, okay.

355
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,500
It is generally true though that I do find, there are people who have

356
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,900
an aptitude for programming and people who don't

357
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,800
It is true that that you have a spectrum, right?

358
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
It's not the case.

359
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,900
I don't necessarily think that every person is like a great programmer

360
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,100
waiting to happen or something like that but I don't really know one

361
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,800
way or the other.

362
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,800
All I can tell you is that just in terms of having worked with

363
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
programmers, before you definitely can see.

364
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,000
Some programmers are just a lot better than other programmers.

365
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,800
Write that is actually true.

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now, why they are aren't?

367
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,200
I have no idea.

368
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,800
Like, I don't

369
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I know that there's like the programming Gene kind of like there's,

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,200
you know, genetics for body types or something like this, where it's

371
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
like, hey, like I said before, probably never going to be a long

372
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,700
distance Runner.

373
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,400
If you just look at the way I'm built, that's probably never going to

374
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,000
happen, right?

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,800
But I don't know that that's true because we don't know very much

376
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,900
about human and you know, mental development and stuff like this.

377
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,600
So it could actually be that everyone could be a great programmer and

378
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,100
it's more about training and and how you know what growing up was like

379
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,800
for you and whether

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Learn the right things at the right time, right?

381
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,700
Like we have no idea where well before the point where we would have

382
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,500
any idea.

383
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,400
Whether this is something that's about how your brain has been

384
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,700
conditioned or whether it's about how your, you know, chemistry Works

385
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,600
internally or who knows what I have no idea.

386
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,000
None whatsoever, but it is definitely true that there.

387
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,400
There's a range of programming, sort of aptitude out there, it does

388
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,900
seem.

389
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:36,400
And so, I think the question is for any individual who is concerned

390
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,500
about their situation and goes okay, you know, first for as far as the

391
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,700
Imposter goes first, make sure you internalize the thing about

392
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,000
programming being difficult.

393
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,700
About even great programmers, having these problems, make sure you've

394
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
actually internalize that.

395
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,200
So actually do understand that these problems are here, take a minute,

396
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,700
to watch some handmade hero.

397
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,100
And remember, after 30 years, look at how much work I have to still do

398
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,900
to, like get things into the right.

399
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,700
Place to experiment with things to to find bugs like to do blah blah

400
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
blah blah, right?

401
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Like think about that and think about how long I've been programming

402
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,100
and there's still

403
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,600
These problems, right?

404
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,700
So keep that in mind and then keep in mind.

405
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,500
The same thing is true for great.

406
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,700
Programmers, you admire, right?

407
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,000
Because I like I said, I've worked with plenty of great programmers

408
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,700
and they have these same things, right?

409
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,000
In fact, you can go watch some of streams of great programmers

410
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
programming, and you will see exactly those same things happen, right?

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,100
So, you know that even after you've done all of that work and gotten

412
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,100
to a place where, you know, you you're

413
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Ordered respected or whatever it is you're not you haven't gotten rid

414
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,300
of those, it doesn't mean you've attained some kind of of superbetter

415
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,000
development process.

416
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,300
You've actually just

417
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,100
Gotten better at the same thing with all the problems that it had,

418
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,500
right?

419
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,300
And you will still have the same psychological problems.

420
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,200
You will still think from day to day.

421
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,900
Oh man, that went really poorly, right?

422
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,000
It's not like I'm sitting here going like every episode of handmade

423
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,300
hero.

424
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,100
We did great or it work.

425
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,900
I'm not always thinking like, well I wrote Amazing code today.

426
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,200
That is not, you know, that's not happening, right?

427
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,900
Part of being a programmer that engineering mindset, is always looking

428
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,200
for the problems with things as well.

429
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
So more often than not, I'm like,

430
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,100
There's all these problems in this code that I wrote, right?

431
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,300
So if you've actually internalize that and found some people who you

432
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,300
look up to who have streams or whatever and watch them, and seen just

433
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,200
how much of a struggle it still is for them even though you know

434
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
they've had way more experience than you.

435
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Right?

436
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,200
Internalize that and then you look and go.

437
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,900
Okay now do I think that maybe I'm questioning whether I'm going to be

438
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,500
good at this?

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,100
Heading up that right?

440
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,200
I factor that out.

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,800
I factored out the, the high probability, I would say that I'm being

442
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,000
too harsh on myself because I'm not looking at the, the flaws in these

443
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
other people, I'm not letting myself.

444
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,900
See just how hard it is for them even after they've had decades more

445
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
experience than I have, right?

446
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
So even factoring that out in.

447
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,600
Now if you're starting to look and say well I just don't know.

448
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to know if I'm going to get this.

449
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:31,300
It seems like I'm having more trouble with this then than I should and

450
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm concerned that maybe I'm just not good enough at it right.

451
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,100
Then I guess what I think you have to ask yourself is

452
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Is there some ways are there?

453
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,300
Some steps you could take to verify that a little bit more

454
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,900
objectively, right?

455
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Or to take a more objective assessment of what you are doing and why

456
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,600
you are failing at it or perceiving that you are failing at it, right?

457
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,500
Because one of the things that's that's true about anything, right?

458
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Is that you need to have some metrics for success and failure.

459
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,600
You need to have some way of analyzing why you did or didn't hit those

460
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,100
metrics if you want to factor out just your subjective opinion, right?

461
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,200
Because if you're talking about something like imposter syndrome, this

462
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,300
is a psychological effect.

463
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,800
You may very well just be unable to see that you are doing something

464
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,900
reasonably well or the potential that you have.

465
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,700
You may just not be able to see it, right?

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You may be and there could be all sorts of reasons for that.

467
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,800
For example, let's say that you're actually a very good programmer,

468
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,700
but you're going to a school that teaches object-oriented programming.

469
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Well, obviously, in your programming, like, by its nature is not good,

470
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,300
right?

471
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,500
Or at least if you take my word for it.

472
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,900
So you maybe being taught something that fundamentally

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,600
Doesn't gel in your brain because it's a fundamentally flawed way of

474
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,700
programming in the first place and your brains actually good at

475
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
programming, right?

476
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,300
And if someone was to just tell you, oh, here is a way of programming

477
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,400
that more better aligns with your Natural Instincts.

478
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,500
It turns out you're really good, right?

479
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,800
So certainly, you have to start from a premise of what is the metric

480
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,900
that I'm actually using?

481
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,400
If it's just that I'm, like, not doing as good on these School

482
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
assignments as other people are.

483
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,800
Or if it's just that like I didn't pass this job interview at Google.

484
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,500
Or something like this, right?

485
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,000
You don't you haven't really learned anything by that because those

486
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,500
metrics may be set up by people who are not good, programmers write

487
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,100
and if they are set up a good programmers, that doesn't necessarily

488
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,800
mean that those programmers were good at making metrics for disturbing

489
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,300
compare numbers.

490
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I've certainly known more than one, good programmer, who was very bad

491
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,700
at interviewing other programmers, and deciding, which ones of them

492
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,700
were good, right?

493
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,900
So, it's also not the case that you can just rely on

494
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Some external measure to tell you whether you're a good programmer or

495
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,900
not because that may not be true.

496
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,400
So I think you have to look and say what is a way that I could create

497
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,200
some things for me to try where I could then more objectively measure

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,400
whether I can do this or whether I can't write.

499
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,200
And I think there are a lot of factors that go into making a good

500
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
programmer and

501
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,700
And, you know, some of them are like being able to kind of work

502
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,900
through math, okay?

503
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Right.

504
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,200
Not in the like math class way, but in the, like kind of handmade hero

505
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,300
Blackboard way, you know, just being able to understand like roughly

506
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,500
what's going on and being able to solve the equations, you need to

507
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,100
solve in the way you need to solve them, right?

508
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,900
There's that there's perseverance, you know, being willing to sit in

509
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,700
front of a computer for many hours a day, trying things and you know

510
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,400
debugging things and all those sorts of things right?

511
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,500
There's being able to keep systems in your head in ways that allow you

512
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,800
to sort of figure out whether they're whether there's things you could

513
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,100
do to help improve them and whether or not they could be working more

514
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,700
efficiently, each other.

515
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,700
There's understanding hardware and understanding how it works.

516
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,400
So that you can have a rough mental model of it and make reasonable

517
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,800
decisions that don't result in really poor.

518
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,900
Operating code and all that sort of stuff, right?

519
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,500
So it's all these sorts of things there.

520
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:29,600
So I think before you should be willing to sort of adopt an opinion,

521
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,500
like maybe I'm not that good at this.

522
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,700
I think you have to come up with some things you can do to try to see

523
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,900
whether you actually are not in a more objective way.

524
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,400
So one example like I said before is pick a very simple thing to write

525
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,100
asteroids like for game development right?

526
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,200
Asteroids is my favorite one for that because it's very, very simple.

527
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,200
But still is a complete game, right?

528
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,800
You know, doing

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Thing like developing asteroids from scratch on Windows or something

530
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,300
like this using opengl let's say or something like that.

531
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,700
Setting out some tasks like this for yourself where you pick something

532
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,700
and you see how far you can get in it, right?

533
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,900
I think are much more reasonable ways of going about determining

534
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
whether or not you can or can't do it.

535
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,300
And the reason for that is I think that

536
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,500
With programming.

537
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,600
A lot of times, the proof is very much in the pudding.

538
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,300
The difference between a programmer who can ship asteroids and a

539
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,700
programmer who can't is that the program who can ship asteroids shift,

540
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,300
asteroids,

541
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,400
Right?

542
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,200
And so at some level I think you have to pick some goals like that.

543
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
See how you do, right?

544
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,400
And if for some reason you are unable to get an Asteroids game working

545
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,200
eventually in something, you know, in it exercise.

546
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,700
Such as this figure out what it was that prevented you from doing it,

547
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,900
lots of people, the thing that will prevent them from doing it, is

548
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,300
they just didn't spend the time they gave up after a couple weeks of

549
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,500
doing

550
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,400
Right?

551
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,100
They just, they just don't do it.

552
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,500
So, it wasn't that they couldn't do it.

553
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
It wasn't that they can't figure it out.

554
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,200
It's that they just don't spend enough time to actually get a working

555
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,700
asteroids together, right?

556
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,600
That is what prevents 90% of programmers from being any good at

557
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,700
programming, right?

558
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,300
That's what prevents some people who actually know a ton about

559
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,900
programming and know a lot about computer science from ever doing

560
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,800
anything useful in programming, right?

561
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
Because a lot of programming is

562
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
Just doing the programming.

563
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,700
So, if that was the case, let's say that what you do is, you sit down

564
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,900
and say, I'm going to write asteroids over the next few months and

565
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,700
what you find is that you never finish.

566
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,900
Asteroids, you never just, you just never it, never even works at all.

567
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,100
Like you never get it up and running, no matter how bad it is.

568
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,700
You now have one answer to whether you are good at programming and

569
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
that is you do not have the perseverance.

570
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,600
Right now, you have a useful thing, you can actually act on.

571
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,500
If it is important to you, that you become a good programmer.

572
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,800
Now, you know, if you want to know whether you'll be good or not, it's

573
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
can you overcome your problem with perseverance?

574
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,400
Can you actually sit and code for longer than you have been in order

575
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,100
to get to the point where you can actually ship stuff, right?

576
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,300
And that is an objective thing.

577
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
If you can't, you now know it was an impostor syndrome, you were

578
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,600
actually allows you at it, right?

579
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,500
Mind you.

580
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,900
I put a big caveat on there.

581
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Plenty of people who are gainfully employed, making lots of money, at

582
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,400
lots of places right now.

583
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,400
Also have that problem.

584
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,000
So before you actually consider yourself, bad at programming relative

585
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
to the rest of the world.

586
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,200
You also kind of have to internalize the fact that I'm talking about,

587
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
actually good programming not getting a job.

588
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Programmer so don't despair.

589
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,700
Even if that's the case, you may come to the conclusion that you're

590
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,500
never going to be a great programmer, that doesn't mean you shouldn't

591
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,400
go get a programming job.

592
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,500
There's plenty of places, especially at web companies that will take

593
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,400
you, and you will never really have to be responsible for doing all

594
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,000
that much code.

595
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,300
Anyway, so

596
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,800
That caveat aside that is an actual actionable thing.

597
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,100
You can work on right and not only is it actionable in the sense that

598
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,300
it's a good decision thing.

599
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:28,900
Am I going to be good?

600
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,600
Perm or not?

601
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
It's something you can work to improve right?

602
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,100
If the thing that's stopping you from getting, Astra is done is

603
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,200
perseverance, work on your perseverance.

604
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Make a rule that you have to program for an hour a day non-stop.

605
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,500
No distractions next week, two hours a day.

606
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,900
Next week, three hours a day.

607
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Next week, four hours a day, right?

608
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
Once you have 24 hours a day,

609
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,700
You should be able to make Asteroids for hours a day.

610
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,000
Might take a while, but a lot of programmers.

611
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,800
No matter, even good programmers.

612
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
Don't get more than four hours a day to program.

613
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,600
A lot of times there's other stuff they have to be doing meetings or

614
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,900
talking with other people about stuff, or going to things or whatever

615
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,800
blah blah, blah dealing with, right.

616
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
So if you can get yourself up to four hours, a day of straight

617
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,600
programming, not reading the internet, not searching stack Overflow,

618
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,800
but four hours a day of typing in code, and running it.

619
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
You can make asteroids.

620
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
So, take that out of the equation.

621
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,600
Next question is, is your Asteroids game?

622
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,300
Just not working?

623
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,700
Are you spending all your time to bugging?

624
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,900
Do not know why it's crashing, whatever right?

625
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
If that's the thing, that's stopping you from getting there.

626
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,500
Now that you're programming for our is a day, ask yourself.

627
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,600
Why am I not able to do these?

628
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,100
Why am I not able to debugging can tie concretely, practice my

629
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,800
debugging skills to get me to the point where I know how to do it.

630
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,100
We show a lot of ways to debug stuff on handmade hero.

631
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,900
Can you watch that?

632
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,400
Can you learn from

633
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,800
That can you write keep a log of the bugs that you're having once you

634
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,200
have found them after 6 hours or however long it took?

635
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,500
You can you then go back and go?

636
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,600
How could I have found this bug faster?

637
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,200
What are the reasons why this bug got into my code base?

638
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,700
And took me a long time to find, right?

639
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,800
Again, a concrete thing.

640
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,100
You can evaluate yourself on.

641
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
If you don't think you could ever get better at it.

642
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,000
You've tried and tried and tried, you're not getting any better.

643
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay?

644
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,400
Imposter syndrome validated you're not a good programmer, right?

645
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:19,900
Right.

646
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,400
Chances are no, you could get better at it and if you work at that and

647
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,900
you put in the time to work at it, you will get better, find those

648
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,100
bugs, and then you will be good at that, right?

649
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,800
And on and on and on and on.

650
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Not right.

651
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,000
So I feel like if you had to boil it down,

652
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,300
Unless you know, like I said, maybe there's some genetic component to

653
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,200
it and you can just be born with a brain.

654
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
That's never going to be good at programming, okay?

655
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,800
If that's the case, whatever there's nothing we can do, right?

656
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
We know that's true for some physical things.

657
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,700
Like I said, I don't think I'm ever going to win, you know, the

658
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,800
Olympic long-distance running thing it's never gonna happen, right?

659
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,600
So maybe there is, I don't know, but assuming that, there isn't then

660
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,800
you might boil down.

661
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
All of what I just said.

662
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,700
Even to one very simple thing which is are you willing to work at

663
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,800
being a good programmer?

664
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,800
And if you are and you really will, you won't just go read Facebook

665
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,200
all day, or whatever it is right.

666
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Instead of actually programming, if you are actually willing to work

667
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,100
at it, unplug your ethernet cable.

668
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,700
So, you can no longer contact the internet and program for 4 hours a

669
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,100
day.

670
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,700
If you are willing to do that and concentrate on it, I really think

671
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,300
that most people who have any affinity for programming at all, can get

672
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,000
to the point where they are reasonable, that it and imposter syndrome

673
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,600
simply wouldn't be warranted.

674
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,200
I think what actually happens more often than not is.

675
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,400
If people are bad at program, it's because they aren't willing to take

676
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,700
the time to do those things.

677
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,800
They would rather go read Facebook, or do whatever else it is answer

678
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,600
emails or go whatever.

679
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,500
Getting a flame war on a forum and then just say that they're not

680
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,600
better programming or feel, you know, let the Imposter syndrome take

681
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,500
its toll on them.

682
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,699
But in reality, I don't know that it was because of something inherent

683
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,800
in them that made them a bad programmer.

684
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,600
I think it's quite possible that the only thing making them a bad

685
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,900
programmer whether inherent or not, is the unwillingness to actually

686
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
do that work, right?

687
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:38,400
So that's my relatively complete answer on imposter syndrome and just

688
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,500
in general how to approach getting to be a better programmer.

689
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:45,699
And again I would just re-emphasize the fact that

690
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,500
You know, a lot of the people that a lot of the people that you see

691
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,800
who, maybe you think are good.

692
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Programmers.

693
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:58,400
Keep in mind that they may also not have been great programmers, when

694
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
they first started, right?

695
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,900
So in a lot of situations, there's people who are pretty fast out of

696
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,400
the gate at something, but, you know, maybe they're curved kind of

697
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
looks, you know, like this sort of thing.

698
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,800
There are other people whose curves look more like that, right?

699
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,500
So just because you may not be good at something, right away.

700
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,500
And this is usually the case with me, by the way, I don't tend to be

701
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,600
good at things like right away.

702
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,900
Necessarily in programming, it typically takes me a long ramp up time

703
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,300
but once I've had that ramp up time then I tend to get very efficient

704
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,600
at the leader or whatever.

705
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,100
Right.

706
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,900
And so if you're a type of person like that, don't be discouraged when

707
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,100
you're first starting out.

708
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,100
If the people around you in school or whatever are better than you at

709
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,900
this that

710
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,300
It mean they're always going to be right.

711
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,900
And typically if you stick with it and like I said, you're very

712
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,500
serious about getting better.

713
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,900
I feel like you should let, give yourself that time and give your hand

714
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,800
and try to challenge yourself, to see whether you really are bad at

715
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
this, or whether it's just

716
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Question of you just need more experience because you have more of a

717
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,600
curve that looks more like that, right?

718
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,000
And one more thing I'll say about that is that I often find that the

719
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,400
people who, you know, take the longest to get something sometimes,

720
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,300
maybe the ones who understand it the best at the end.

721
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,500
So sometimes it takes a lot longer to really understand something at a

722
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,000
deep level, it may appear that this person isn't really as Snappy as

723
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
their peers but later they end up doing things their peers couldn't

724
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,400
do.

725
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,100
And the reason for that is their learning process is deeper.

726
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,100
It takes longer, but it's more complete, right?

727
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,700
And more facile at the end.

728
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,500
And so again, don't assume just because you've taken a few sample

729
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,400
points relative to some other people doing the same things.

730
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:46,900
You're doing.

731
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,600
Don't assume that that that, you know what, the real curves look.

732
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,500
Like you may not be at the point where you can really make that

733
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,000
assessment yet, right?

734
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:06,600
So I would say that that is a really sort of broad answer to the

735
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,000
Imposter syndrome question and I don't know that I have any specific

736
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,500
opinions about it Beyond, you know, specific opinions about The

737
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,200
Imposter syndrome part of it as a separate.

738
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Kind of Peace again because I I didn't grow up with it.

739
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,900
I didn't.

740
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,300
Grow up with.

741
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,900
I don't mean I didn't grow up thinking that way.

742
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,500
I mean I didn't grow up with that as a term.

743
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,200
So the part of my history that this would have really been more

744
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,900
related to is so far back in my head now that I can't remember if

745
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,100
these were things that I thought or not, you know, like, I can't

746
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,900
remember if I ever had something that would have been imposter

747
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,100
syndrome back at that time because it's you know, you know, I would

748
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,400
have been so young.

749
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,200
Young right.

750
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,700
So that part, I really couldn't speak to, but the rest of it, I think

751
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,800
hopefully, I've kind of laid out what I think in terms of the like.

752
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,400
Am I good programmer or not question that you may be asking yourself

753
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,000
and how do I, you know, maybe assess that a little bit more

754
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,600
realistically?

755
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,800
I think that's the only sensible approach to something like, imposter

756
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,600
syndrome because I just, I don't think that your emotional reaction to

757
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,900
a question like that.

758
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,600
Is going to ever really be unbiased enough to go with, right?

759
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,700
I feel like there's probably no question that there's plenty of people

760
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,500
out there who feel no impostor syndrome at all who are actually awful

761
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
at what they do, right.

762
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,200
And I'm equally sure that there's plenty of people out there who feel

763
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,000
a lot of imposter syndrome themselves, but are actually very good at

764
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
what they do, right?

765
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,800
So,

766
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,500
I don't think you can take those feelings at face value.

767
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,000
And I do think that it's important.

768
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,800
If it's something you care about to take it more seriously, and and

769
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,500
try to do some objective, some well, unless there's anyone can ever be

770
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:21,200
more objective exercises to really work through that and figure out,

771
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,400
whether you can take some more realistic measurements of this and

772
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,000
figure out whether you have what it takes to be a good programmer or

773
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
not.

774
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:29,900
And

775
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,200
I think that if nothing else going through that process will itself

776
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,500
make you a better programmer.

777
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Even if for some reason psychologically, you're never really able to

778
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,300
convince yourself to get out of the Imposter syndrome mindset, you

779
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,800
know.

780
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,500
It certainly can't hurt to do exercises like that and if nothing else

781
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,600
it proves to you, that you can ship stuff and can do stuff that is,

782
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
you know, that is at least done, right?

783
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,900
Because that yeah at the end.

784
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
Of the day just getting code.

785
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,800
That's done and works.

786
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
Puts you in a category of programmers.

787
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,300
That's a pretty good already right because there's plenty of people

788
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,400
who just get nothing done, most of the time and you're already ahead

789
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
of them, right?

790
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,800
So yeah, I think that's mostly what I would say.

791
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,500
I don't know at this point, it's probably at this at this point in the

792
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,100
Stream.

793
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,100
I guess what I would say is, we're so far in we only have 20 minutes

794
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,800
left.

795
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,000
I would say maybe we'll just switch this to a chat and if I could, I

796
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,200
guess I'll maybe take questions and answers on this topic if people

797
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:38,800
have them.

798
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,200
If anything that I said, wasn't reasonable or you would disagree with

799
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,300
it.

800
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,900
You could put that in the chat now too, so I could maybe address it

801
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,700
and I guess I would also say if anyone has any follow-up questions to

802
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:57,400
that, where it's like, if there were parts of that, if there were

803
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,000
parts of that answer, that didn't go into enough detail in a section

804
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,500
that you cared about I would be happy to address those as well.

805
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,700
So, if you want to go ahead and go to the chat stream, just put a q:

806
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,500
in front of it.

807
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,100
I will address any questions about the Imposter.

808
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,800
Something that people might have.

809
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,400
In summary again, I would just say important things are one get to a

810
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,000
place where you know what matters to you and what doesn't right

811
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,000
because don't don't spend your life thinking.

812
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,500
You have to be a good programmer or a good, anything else if that's

813
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,200
not what actually matters to you, right?

814
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,000
I mean so figure out the matters what matters to you and what doesn't

815
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,600
then figure out if it does matter to you and you don't feel confident

816
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,500
in it, figure out what objective steps you could take that could start

817
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:47,900
to

818
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,000
Help you see for real, whether you are or not, rather than a

819
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,700
subjective feeling that is probably wrong or at the very least

820
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,300
inconclusive.

821
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,900
And then as a result of that go, what have I?

822
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,700
Learn from this.

823
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,600
Does it tell me things that I could work on to improve?

824
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,200
Because maybe it's not that.

825
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm a bad programmer, maybe it's that.

826
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,800
I just have specific flaws that if I address those flaws.

827
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,500
I would be a good programmer, right?

828
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,600
And that's just a question of practice and experience that you can

829
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,000
overcome.

830
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,100
And so, it's, I think it's very important.

831
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,500
Like I said to really kind of work through that and don't let your

832
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,900
subjective impression of how good you have a programmer.

833
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,800
You are be the thing that holds you back.

834
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,900
Back because it is probably not so well.

835
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,700
Founded.

836
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,500
So, let's see whether or not there were any questions.

837
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,700
To do do.

838
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,900
This drunk Dane, how to battle the urge to have 100 different, small

839
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,100
projects around and stay focused on a single project.

840
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,100
That is an excellent question.

841
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,600
So, I guess what I would say about that is it is a constant struggle.

842
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,300
So I can speak from personal experience and say that, you know, if

843
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:34,200
you're anything like me, you always want to fix everything, right?

844
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,800
You're always like this seems broken.

845
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,000
I could fix it, right?

846
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,200
But in reality you don't have time, right?

847
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,800
You may not think that but you don't write even at this point.

848
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,300
Like I said, programming, for 30 years, I am still always doing

849
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,600
stupid.

850
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,800
Stuff like going this thing's broken, I'm gonna go fix it.

851
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,300
Not realizing that, you know, that is not feasible in my schedule or

852
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,300
whatever it is, right?

853
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,600
So I would say if you can, and

854
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,200
If you're lucky, you'll be better than me at this.

855
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,100
So this is in no way speaking of imposter syndrome, this is in no way

856
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:18,500
me trying to say, eventually you'll get to be able to do this well

857
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:24,200
because I can't, and I don't know, very many people who can so, you

858
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,700
know, I'm more saying aspirational fantasy, right?

859
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,900
Because you do kind of get a little better at over time but, you know,

860
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
aspirational fantasy

861
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,900
Is as much as you can think of any particular programming problem as

862
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,800
taking an unbounded amount of time, and it sounds a little bit weird,

863
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,700
but an unbounded amount of time.

864
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,100
Meaning.

865
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,900
Whatever the program is you were going to write.

866
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,100
I'm fairly certain you could spend the rest of your life writing that

867
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,600
program.

868
00:44:59,600 --> 00:44:59,700
The.

869
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,700
I say that is because okay, you write the program.

870
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,100
How efficient is the program?

871
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Could it be more efficient?

872
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,100
Could it be more portable?

873
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,000
Probably, it could.

874
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,600
Probably it could write, is it written as concisely as possible?

875
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,700
Probably not is the language.

876
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,700
It's written in, not capable of expressing how concise it should be

877
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,500
possibly.

878
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,700
Maybe you need to rewrite the language to do that.

879
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:27,000
Right is the architecture is the is the, you know, is the machine, the

880
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,700
operating system letting it be as efficient as possible.

881
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,600
Well, maybe not, maybe you need to rewrite that right, Bubba, right.

882
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,700
In order to completely solve any programming problem, you will spend

883
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,400
the rest of your life and possibly not solve it, right?

884
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:44,100
So the first thing to understand is there is no such thing as like,

885
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,500
figuring out how long it takes to Mesa, make a piece of code.

886
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,800
There's only a question of how long it will take you to make a certain

887
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,100
piece of code at a certain level of quality, right?

888
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:02,200
So what that means very directly with no, it's I feel like this is an

889
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,900
objective statement at this point.

890
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,700
If you accept that premise, that may be subjective, maybe not.

891
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,700
But if you have to accept that premise, the next thing is objective

892
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:14,500
and that is everything you decide to do.

893
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,300
Makes whatever other things you were doing worse.

894
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,700
.

895
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,900
because however much time you spend on whatever the next that the

896
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:32,300
other project or adding to your list is that is how much worse the

897
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,100
project you were working on will get

898
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,700
And that's at a minimum because it doesn't count any task switching

899
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,900
overhead, right?

900
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,200
So even if we assume zero, task-switching overhead, if you have a

901
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,800
project a and you're like oh well I could just do Project B, you have

902
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,700
now subtracted, the quality that amount of quality from your other

903
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,400
project

904
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,300
And that's just the truth.

905
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,000
It's a zero-sum game, right?

906
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,300
It's like, every time you choose to take on a new project, you are

907
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,000
making another project worse.

908
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And I of all people have it at tremendously difficult, time dealing

909
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,500
with this.

910
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,100
Because I always want to know, I'm sorry, I always want to go do

911
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:15,700
something.

912
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,400
That's, like, I could fix this, right?

913
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,800
And when you look at something, it even gets worse, as you get better

914
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,300
at programming.

915
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,200
Because chances, are you look at something, you know, you could do a

916
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,000
better job.

917
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,400
You know, you could and you're not even wrong, like you may be totally

918
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,700
right, that you could do a different, a better job.

919
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,800
The problem is however, long.

920
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,600
It's going to take you to do that better job.

921
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,400
However, long.

922
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,900
It's gonna take you to exceed that quality bar is now quality that's

923
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
coming out of your other project, right?

924
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,100
And so, you really, really do have to understand that trade-off and I

925
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,300
think that if you can actually internalize that, it is something that

926
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,800
helps you make those decisions.

927
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,600
Those hard decisions.

928
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,200
I want to

929
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,900
Do X.

930
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,900
I just saw this thing and I want to go do that right now, right?

931
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,800
You have to

932
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,800
Wait, that will make my whatever thing out game I'm working on now

933
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,900
that much worse, right?

934
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,900
So, the first thing I'd say is try to internalize that.

935
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,700
The second thing I would try to say is if you are starting to lose

936
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,000
interest in a project finish the project, make it be a goal that you

937
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,100
always finish the project, right?

938
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,700
Even if it's bad, just finish it.

939
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,900
Because a lot of times it's before starting the new one because a lot

940
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,200
of times it's simply it's enough to get you over the infatuation.

941
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
You have with whatever the new product is.

942
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,400
You were going to start to force yourself to finish the old one,

943
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,700
because a lot of times what happens is, you'll get to a point in a

944
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:40,600
project where there's

945
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,100
Hard work to be done and it's just more fun to go.

946
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,400
Try.

947
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Some other thing don't do that, right?

948
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,700
Make yourself finish the thing that you were working on.

949
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,800
So that you can, you know, at least call it done and chance already

950
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,200
come back to that, you may forget about how exciting that other thing

951
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,300
was for a while because maybe it really isn't that exciting after all.

952
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
And when you go start that project you would hit the exact same point

953
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
in that project at some point, right?

954
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:13,200
So I would say try to think about those things, more helicity if you

955
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,400
can and it might help.

956
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I don't know for a fact that there isn't some value in having more

957
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,200
than one project though and the reason for that is that there may be a

958
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,700
sweet spot that's not one The Sweet Spot maybe say to.

959
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,800
And the reason for that is that it may be possible to just be too

960
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,900
burned out on one project and you kind of need one to ping-pong back

961
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,200
and forth between and so I don't want to say that.

962
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,300
I know that there's an answer there because I don't know that we know

963
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:40,900
for sure.

964
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:49,400
I do think, for example, I believe you know, you'd have to ask John

965
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,500
but I believe Jonathan.

966
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,800
Blow would probably say that it helps to have two projects because

967
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,300
sometimes you just need to be able to switch back and forth between

968
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,700
them in order to keep yourself motivated.

969
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,500
If one of them is very big, right?

970
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,700
Like if the witness is your main project, you may need jii as a side

971
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,500
project because without it you just you can't do seven years of work.

972
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,800
Thing without switching back and forth little bit on it, right?

973
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,000
So it may be that.

974
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
At some point you will find your optimal productivity is to have two

975
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,400
things.

976
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,200
Not one right?

977
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,500
It's probably not to have ten though but what I would say about that

978
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,000
is again, can you take an objective approach to it?

979
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,400
Can you look and see?

980
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,700
Am I making better progress when I have two things when I enter leave?

981
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,100
Or if I just stick with one try to actually measure the progress to

982
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,500
some degree and make an informed decision.

983
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,400
Ian about it, don't just assume that adding more products is better

984
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,900
because it feels better to do or whatever right try to actually make

985
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,300
that decision.

986
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,600
And once you know, that should be a good argument for you as to what

987
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,200
to do, if you know your faster when you're always focusing on one

988
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,600
project stopped taking on other projects right, that's the best thing

989
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:58,900
for you.

990
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,800
That's the best thing for shipping.

991
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Quality piece of software and being proud of it.

992
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,800
At the end of the day, is doing it that way, right?

993
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,300
Allen asks, this is slightly related to one thing.

994
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,000
You said I have been getting the feeling that programmers in general

995
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,400
are bad at taking objective measurements of things.

996
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,100
Like how good am I with maybe the exception of how long a chunk of

997
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:32,900
code takes?

998
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,900
Would you agree that the assessment?

999
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,900
Would you agree with that assessment and do you think we suffer a lot

1000
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,700
because of it?

1001
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,800
I do.

1002
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,000
100% agree with that assessment.

1003
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,500
And I do also 100% agree that we suffer a lot because of it.

1004
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,600
I would say that the number of things that I have found through when

1005
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,700
I've been programming, in terms of like, successes that I can say,

1006
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,700
like, where I've been like oh, you know, this some things went really

1007
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,300
well here.

1008
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:09,300
Many, many times, the reason the things that led to those successes

1009
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:15,100
are exactly that thing you're talking about of figuring out, a way to

1010
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,600
take a more objective approach to something.

1011
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,100
It was just dogmatic before, right?

1012
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,200
You know, even like the build-up, bat way that we build things on,

1013
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,900
handmade hero is a very good example of just being objective about

1014
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,800
things, right?

1015
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,600
It's like, what is the simplest thing?

1016
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,900
We can do here, that produces the fastest turnaround, for building

1017
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,600
this game, that creates the least problems when you actually look at

1018
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,500
it objectively like that.

1019
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,800
You find that A build-up at file is so much better than every make

1020
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,600
system that anyone's ever made like in the history of time, right?

1021
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,100
Right?

1022
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,700
So the question is, well why you know what?

1023
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,300
How do we end up in a situation where we aren't?

1024
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,200
We're all doing this already and it's just because well there's we

1025
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,100
don't constantly measure those things, like nobody is measuring those

1026
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:01,500
things.

1027
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,400
So sure, way back when there is probably some reason to have a make

1028
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,400
because compiling took longer and, you know, Bubba blonde, there was

1029
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,500
reasons to track these things maybe, and we had two separate things

1030
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:14,900
for various reasons, they didn't, you couldn't concatenate all the

1031
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,800
files together and compile them, because there was enough memory on

1032
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,700
the machine even

1033
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
To do this, right?

1034
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,800
And so you have to remember that there may be very sane objective

1035
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,300
reasons for things way back in the past.

1036
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:28,400
But what you're doing now is a product of that long chain of

1037
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:28,800
reasoning.

1038
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,500
That was right at the time, but not be right now.

1039
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,600
And so I absolutely do think the more you can force yourself to go, is

1040
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,400
there a metric here?

1041
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,600
I can look at, can I look at build times?

1042
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,800
Can I look at number of amount of hours spent on the build system that

1043
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,900
I'm actually spending maintaining the build system.

1044
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,900
Can I look at?

1045
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,000
You know, how maintainable this thing was for me?

1046
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,600
Can I look at metrics like this that even if they're not pure

1047
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,000
objective or at least more objective than

1048
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,800
I read on.

1049
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,800
Some internet message board that cmake is better than some than good

1050
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,300
new make.

1051
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:10,400
So I'm using it or whatever or ninja is important to making builds

1052
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,100
better and so I did it.

1053
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,100
If you can find some more ways to a objective evaluate things, those

1054
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:24,700
things are going to lead you often times too much better results

1055
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,100
because often in many stories of programming, no one has actually done

1056
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,900
that.

1057
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,800
Active measurement, right?

1058
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,700
We're very good as programmers.

1059
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,600
For some reason, we're very good at objectively measuring, what the

1060
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,500
hardware does.

1061
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,500
So, optimizing things has been a discipline that many people have been

1062
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:46,300
very good at what, we're not so good at is objectively measuring us.

1063
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,400
And so, programming practices inherently.

1064
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,100
We are not very good at optimizing and it's important to get better

1065
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,300
because the better that, you know, getting better at those pays

1066
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,800
dividends everywhere, right?

1067
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,700
It means better code.

1068
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,700
In less time with less people at less cost, which is always kind of a

1069
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,300
good thing.

1070
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,000
Somewhat related, a final update on the TA.

1071
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,400
We talked about his talk on raytracer efficiency.

1072
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,700
When he got to the GPU side of things, basically broke down into use

1073
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,300
op, 2x GPU, programming is hard, so I don't even know to him.

1074
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,700
Yes.

1075
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,300
Oh, so that's a

1076
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,300
That was someone who had talked to me about, they had a TA who had

1077
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,000
told them that their raytracer would be better if it had virtual

1078
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
functions in it.

1079
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,800
No, other explanation.

1080
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,100
Just it would have better if it was a fun time.

1081
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:49,100
Like I couldn't tell you any rate Racers that got better because of

1082
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,400
virtual functions, they can only really make a ray Tracer worse.

1083
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,500
I think most of the time but you know, whatever.

1084
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,800
And so yeah, I mean this kind of gets back to the Imposter syndrome

1085
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,400
thing like you can find plenty.

1086
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,300
Your people who, you know, might be a professor at a university who

1087
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,400
actually has no idea how to program effectively at, all right.

1088
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,400
So maybe, you know, wrapping the whole discussion in just one big

1089
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,900
thing that says, no matter how bad you are at programming, there

1090
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,100
probably is a prominent person who's actually just as bad.

1091
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:28,900
So maybe don't again, don't write yourself off prematurely because

1092
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,100
there are a lot of really bad programmers out there, right?

1093
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,400
It's, it's, it is not a field.

1094
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,300
Is marked by Excellence, like, so many fields.

1095
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,200
The average case is really bad and so, you know,

1096
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,900
Don't don't, don't be harder on yourself.

1097
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,700
Then you would be on some prominent people about their right.

1098
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,200
Like

1099
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,500
Burger love.

1100
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,700
Let's say you are someone who is really drawn to starting and growing

1101
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,900
your own projects in a tough.

1102
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,500
Mister you like this while.

1103
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,100
Some people are getting experience at big studios.

1104
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,000
You're fighting through the details of smaller projects.

1105
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,400
Do you think in the long run?

1106
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,400
It could really hurt you because of how you look on paper.

1107
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,500
I guess, I don't know.

1108
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,000
I would say that.

1109
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,700
I don't think it would really hurt you.

1110
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,300
If you've done a good job and did actually learn a lot from those

1111
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,800
projects, I think it's pretty clear most of the time when you've

1112
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,700
gotten good enough at programming to be useful to it, to a game

1113
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,200
studio.

1114
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,800
So, I don't know that, that would really be the case.

1115
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,700
However, I would agree that, maybe, if you don't get that good at it,

1116
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,500
let's say you weren't going to get that good.

1117
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,600
In either case, then you do have the problem of.

1118
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,500
Well, if I had gone to a bigger company and you know,

1119
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,800
I didn't really get very good necessarily.

1120
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,300
But now I've got a bit of a resume behind me, that may make it easier

1121
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,500
for you to get better jobs, right?

1122
00:57:53,500 --> 00:58:00,100
That's just a potential nature of our way that our systems work in

1123
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,200
terms of hiring and how we assign value to individuals that they're

1124
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,100
not purely based on the individuals, aptitude right?

1125
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,300
And so yeah, I couldn't say for sure, I couldn't say for sure.

1126
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,900
I would also say that I wouldn't discount working at a big company in

1127
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,400
terms of a learning experience separate from that because working with

1128
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,800
other good programmers is a very important part of becoming a good

1129
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,800
programmer I think.

1130
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,700
And so working at a company where there aren't any good programmers at

1131
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,200
all.

1132
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,200
Maybe that's not so useful.

1133
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,300
But most companies might have at least one or two people who

1134
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,700
Going to be better than you when you're just starting out certainly

1135
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,400
and being able to work with them.

1136
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,900
A little bit, is going to be a valuable experience for you.

1137
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,500
And so what I would say is, you know,

1138
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:54,900
It's not as cut and dry as maybe your question sort of purports it to

1139
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,300
be.

1140
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,400
Because at some level I do think that being a part of a team.

1141
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,500
Unless you really are just always the best person in the room or

1142
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,100
something.

1143
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,300
Which again, when you're just starting out, is it that realistic

1144
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:10,900
probably not.

1145
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,300
I mean, maybe you're a prodigy or something but then so sure.

1146
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,100
But you know, I think the average case won't be true.

1147
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,800
There are people you can learn from

1148
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,000
And that's valuable in and of itself.

1149
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So I would say there's more to that question potentially, if that

1150
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,600
makes sense.

1151
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,700
We're largest restoration currently, is that large sections of my code

1152
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:32,100
currently?

1153
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,900
Get rejected or Rewritten in review.

1154
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,400
Is there anything I can do proactively to help myself, right?

1155
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,600
More efficient code IE teach myself how to approach some problems

1156
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,000
better.

1157
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,700
A lot of the patterns I used regularly are turning out to be

1158
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,600
suboptimal.

1159
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,600
well, I guess that's a tough one for me to answer because I don't know

1160
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,500
I had since I can't see what an example of code is that you've

1161
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,100
submitted that then gets rejected or something and it's like, you

1162
00:59:59,100 --> 00:59:59,400
know,

1163
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,300
I can't speak to anything specifically about that.

1164
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,600
But what I would say is it sounds like let's let's assume that the

1165
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,800
people rejecting and rewriting the code or reviewing the code, who are

1166
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,700
we write it in reviewer.

1167
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,000
Whatever our are actually good.

1168
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,100
So let's assume that they're doing a good job.

1169
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,700
Well, then you should have a very clear path towards Improvement,

1170
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,400
right?

1171
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,100
You should study those changes.

1172
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,900
So what you do is say, here is the code I submitted and I should I can

1173
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,500
write down.

1174
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,800
Let me write, let me write down.

1175
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,600
Next to it.

1176
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,800
My thought process that went into why I wrote the code this way do

1177
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,500
that before you submit it when you submit it now you have the changes

1178
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:44,100
that they made and the parts that they rewrote now ask yourself what

1179
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,500
was it in my thought process that did not allow me to get to this

1180
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,100
solution that I think is better.

1181
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,500
If you don't think the solution is better, maybe it's not.

1182
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,800
So you have to first verify that the people who are rewriting, the

1183
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,300
code are better than you and are doing a better job, right?

1184
01:00:59,100 --> 01:00:59,800
But assuming that they are

1185
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,800
That should give you exactly the feedback loop.

1186
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,300
You need, you should be able to see, here's what they did.

1187
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,200
Where was the error in my thought process?

1188
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,600
What wasn't I considering, and you should start to see some patterns

1189
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,100
emerge there about what you're not considering, maybe it's that you

1190
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,200
don't have a strong enough background in data, structures and

1191
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:18,600
algorithms.

1192
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,800
So, you're just not aware of some of the techniques you could use,

1193
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,700
maybe you're not thinking about the hardware enough, so you're making

1194
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,200
decisions based on something that isn't really related to how the

1195
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,800
machines going to use the code and so you're making bad decisions

1196
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
because of the cash or

1197
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,100
Something else that was not in your model, right?

1198
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:39,800
Figure out where your mental process went wrong and that will give you

1199
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,200
the path to success, that will show you what do I need to start

1200
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,600
studying and practicing in order to stop having these people get code?

1201
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,400
That's better than the code that I'm writing.

1202
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,500
Hopefully, that makes some sense.

1203
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,400
Just drunk tame by to it.

1204
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,700
By the way, I thought the my rocket I was didn't have internet.

1205
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,700
You are correct.

1206
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,900
It did not and we just got it installed.

1207
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,300
That is why the handmade hero machine moved over here, finally,

1208
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:16,900
because we were required by a contract to have a static IP address.

1209
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,200
So we had to get one.

1210
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,300
We still did not plug any of the Molly rocket machines into the

1211
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,600
internet, so it is just the handmade hero machine that is on it.

1212
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,900
And then, we will plug in the, you know, one machine that's used for

1213
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,200
that contract will plug-in eventually, but that is, you know, the

1214
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,800
limits of what we will be doing there, if that makes sense.

1215
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,600
So there won't be any actual

1216
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,500
We still don't plug any of the actual development stations into the

1217
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,200
internet.

1218
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:51,700
And since I don't really like having the internet on at work, that is

1219
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,700
the way it would remain.

1220
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,800
Certainly if someone you know in particular individually wanted it,

1221
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,400
they're welcome to it but I would not

1222
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,600
I don't have it on my machine or won't have it on my machine.

1223
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,900
Let's see.

1224
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Empire Tycoon.

1225
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,300
Hey, Casey, I'm new to programming.

1226
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,700
Have been studying information system for two years.

1227
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,000
My problem is I can't start projects at all.

1228
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,100
I always get stuck and by the end of the day, I get nothing done, all

1229
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,100
that I wanted was to start something to improve my skills.

1230
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,200
Would fall asleep for a while?

1231
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,100
What should I do?

1232
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
so, my recommendation there,

1233
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,200
I guess what I'd say is, can you be more specific about what you mean

1234
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,000
by?

1235
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,500
I get stuck by the end of the day, I get nothing done.

1236
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,400
What is can you say more specifically?

1237
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:53,200
What does get stuck mean, right?

1238
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,300
Like Define get stuck does get stuck mean.

1239
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,400
You don't know how to do something in the code that you needed to do.

1240
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,600
Like I wanted to, you know, print out.

1241
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,200
Value.

1242
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,700
But I didn't know how to print it out and I got stuck or is it more

1243
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,400
like I just don't know what to do next.

1244
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:16,100
Like I'm not sure whether I should be printing out a value at all like

1245
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,900
I didn't it wasn't like I knew what to do and didn't know how to do

1246
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,100
it.

1247
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,300
It's that I just don't even know what I should really be doing.

1248
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,200
I'm just kind of staring at a blank editor going.

1249
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,800
I don't know.

1250
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,400
So what does get stuck mean in this particular sense?

1251
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:03,200
I guess while I wait for that one, I'll look at the other Q here.

1252
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,300
What is the thought process behind?

1253
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,600
Not having the internet, is it just for staying on task?

1254
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,400
Avoiding distraction or for some other reason, how do you look up

1255
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,000
documentation and things of that nature?

1256
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,300
It's just for staying on task.

1257
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,700
I find that if the internet's there you know you get I don't like

1258
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:23,200
being distracted and I find that, you know, rather than try to teach

1259
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,200
myself self discipline about that sort of thing.

1260
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,000
I find that the easiest way is to just

1261
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,400
Have it because there is no need for the internet when you're

1262
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,100
programming.

1263
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,900
It doesn't really help you in any way in my opinion.

1264
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:40,800
So,

1265
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:42,900
I just find that.

1266
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,500
All it does is create distractions.

1267
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,800
That's not to say that.

1268
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,400
I don't like reading things on the internet that are related to

1269
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,900
programming or, like, to look things up.

1270
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:57,100
It's just those things can be done offline or not offline after

1271
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:57,500
programming.

1272
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,800
So, what I'll do typically it's like

1273
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,300
Okay, you know, I'm working on this thing that's involves like

1274
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,100
multi-threaded, you know, file handling, you know, file handling on

1275
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:09,900
win32.

1276
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,600
The night before that, I'll just read a bunch of stuff on it and save

1277
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:19,600
off articles and whatever I want on to a drive, right?

1278
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,800
And I bring that with me to work and then when I'm working I have all

1279
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,600
my research there, right?

1280
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,800
And that allows me to compare compartmentalize the two things which I

1281
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,000
think is very important because if you're always in a research mode,

1282
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
if you're always like I'm going to look up on the internet.

1283
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,100
I feel like what you end up doing is you just end up reading on the

1284
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,500
internet way more than you actually needed to read to solve the

1285
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,700
I'm right, you're just kind of like spending time reading cuz it's

1286
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,600
always easier to read than to do work right.

1287
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,600
So I try to compartmentalize things, right?

1288
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:56,900
If I let you know and then anything I during the day where i'm like I,

1289
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,900
you know, during the day I'm like I got a I got something here that I

1290
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:04,200
didn't anticipate and I need more information about it.

1291
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,200
I just write that down and then I go on to something else and then

1292
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,400
I'll come back to it the next day, because in the interesting evening,

1293
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,400
I can look it up.

1294
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:20,000
If I really am at a place where I 100% need the internet right now to

1295
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,900
do something, which happens very rarely.

1296
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:26,800
But, once in a while it happens, then I always just have like, before

1297
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,900
we had internet at the office.

1298
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:30,800
Like, now I would just take a laptop over plug-in.

1299
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,500
Go look up.

1300
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,500
The one thing and go back.

1301
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,300
If I really need it to write, and I like having that requirement

1302
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,600
there.

1303
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,400
So, it's clear that I'm doing that and I have to actually make a

1304
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,900
mental switch to do it.

1305
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,400
I would prefer it be more than that.

1306
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,300
But what can I say, we had to do it for the contract before that there

1307
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,200
was internet in the lobby where we are in the building we're in.

1308
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,500
So I would just go down there and look it up and then come back,

1309
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:55,300
right?

1310
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,600
And I like having that really dramatic I have to completely switch

1311
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,400
gears so that I know I have to make a mental decision.

1312
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,300
This yes, this is important enough to waste this time to go get it.

1313
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,800
Okay, I'll do it and most of the time I find, I just don't need that

1314
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,600
because most of programming is not looking things.

1315
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,000
Up.

1316
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,300
Like, if I'm looking things up, it means I don't really understand

1317
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,000
what I'm doing.

1318
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:21,399
And in my mind, that's better a better thing to be doing during study

1319
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:21,899
time.

1320
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,899
So like I said, you know, let's say, I want to do, you know, some work

1321
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:28,000
with compression or something like this, right?

1322
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:34,100
You know where I'm just like, okay, I don't know very much about

1323
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:37,200
compression and I need to write some compression stuff, right?

1324
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:42,100
Well, you know, that's like a research thing and I need to spend

1325
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,700
several nights like, reading about this thing.

1326
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,100
Internalizing it getting some papers, like, right.

1327
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,600
And that's, I'm going to build up this like, directory somewhere on my

1328
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,000
machine.

1329
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,500
It's like all of my compression research and then I'm going to go

1330
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,700
start writing some code.

1331
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,700
I'm not going to just start writing the code and try to like cut and

1332
01:08:59,800 --> 01:08:59,899
Hey.

1333
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,200
Some stuff from stack, Overflow or whatever, right?

1334
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,600
So the idea that I need the Internet like interleaved with typing in

1335
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,500
my editor, it just doesn't square with my experience of how I write

1336
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,100
code.

1337
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,100
That doesn't mean that other people, maybe don't have different ways

1338
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,899
of doing it, but it's definitely the case for me, that like, that is

1339
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:17,200
not how I write code.

1340
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:18,800
I have to like either are either.

1341
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,200
I'm trying to understand something in which case, yes, the internet,

1342
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,200
very important.

1343
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,300
I got to have papers.

1344
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:28,100
I want download the papers I want to scroll through everything, read

1345
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,600
people's blogs, about it, whatever.

1346
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,600
I want to consolidate all that and then digest it and then start

1347
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,100
programming.

1348
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,200
I don't want to like be ping-ponging back and forth between those

1349
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,899
that's not how I like to do it.

1350
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:47,600
Huh.

1351
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,100
Show?

1352
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,000
Do you think web programmers simply don't aspire to be better?

1353
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,600
Programmers.

1354
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,100
Don't know what good programming is or simply don't care.

1355
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,000
What should we do to entertain their minds from this evil?

1356
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,200
All right.

1357
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,600
Well, first of all, I would say

1358
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,700
I think that there's a bit of a systemic problem there.

1359
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:15,400
Certainly, I don't think I don't think anyone doesn't aspire to be a

1360
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:16,300
good programmer, right?

1361
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,000
I think it's just a question of understanding what that means.

1362
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,800
And one of the things is that game programmers have in some sense, a

1363
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:30,600
luxury that that web programmers nowadays do not have, which is that

1364
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:30,900
game?

1365
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:35,700
Programmers are oftentimes writing fairly close to the code?

1366
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:36,200
That's actually

1367
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,300
Executed on the machine, right?

1368
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,900
They are writing in x64 Assembly Language if they want to their

1369
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,000
writing and see that gets compiled to that in a way that they

1370
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
understand.

1371
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,800
You know, sometimes they're writing GPU Shader code that they can see

1372
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,700
how to a certain extent, it's going to be executed.

1373
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,400
Well, there's tons of stuff in between there and what actually

1374
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,300
happens, don't get me wrong, but it's you have a very close

1375
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,200
relationship to what's actually happening computer.

1376
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,800
So you know what's possible.

1377
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,200
And what's not to a certain degree, people that came up to the web

1378
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,900
programming world have never had that luxury, really, right.

1379
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,700
I mean by the nature of the best they can possibly do is things are

1380
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:26,800
going to run on a browser and the browser is so much big of a, you

1381
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,500
know, sort of jump above all of

1382
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,700
At that it's unclear that most web programmers.

1383
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,400
If they didn't come from, a different discipline ever have the

1384
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,300
opportunity to know really what the best possible version of their

1385
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,800
program would be because their first of all may never have had the

1386
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,700
experience of writing the low-level stuff to know, but also even if

1387
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:54,300
they did well what are they going to do about it right?

1388
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,600
So you know, it definitely, I think being

1389
01:11:59,700 --> 01:11:59,800
Ying.

1390
01:11:59,800 --> 01:11:59,900
So,

1391
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
Are removed from being able to actually control the hardware and not

1392
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,700
having any any real prospects for ever doing.

1393
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:12,200
So I think definitely creates a sort of a culture that is not about

1394
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:16,100
performance and is not about trying to figure out what would be the

1395
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,300
optimal thing to do there.

1396
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:24,100
So I think in some sense you might say, the real fault, may not even

1397
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,600
really be with the programmers there.

1398
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,000
It's in the platform, right?

1399
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,900
The problem was the platform.

1400
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,100
If this platform had been about making something that you could be,

1401
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:40,900
right, very portable things that were fairly native in some way, and

1402
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:42,000
that was the standard.

1403
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,200
I think maybe you wouldn't, you would see people kind of go down that

1404
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:46,800
route.

1405
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,000
So there's that and then on the other side, I would say almost the

1406
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,600
exact same logic applies.

1407
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,800
If you have to spin up an AWS amorphous,

1408
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Esther, that's a virtual machine kind of a thing that you're not

1409
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,500
really sure.

1410
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,100
Even if it's a real machine or part of an existing machine, that's

1411
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,100
doing some stuff in a network, that's I don't know where it is and I

1412
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:13,000
don't really know how long it takes packets to get there and blah blah

1413
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,500
blah.

1414
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:18,500
If you're dealing with all of this, you know kind of uncertainty it's

1415
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:22,700
very hard to develop a culture of really caring about how fast the

1416
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,600
response time is to a user thing, right?

1417
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,800
Or whatever because you don't even know you have

1418
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:33,100
I've no idea how long it will even take your virtual cluster to even

1419
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,000
be up, or whether it's up or how that even happens, you may have no

1420
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,200
idea how their load balancer doing anything, right?

1421
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,800
So you're so far for moved from it that I think that again on either

1422
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:46,300
side but the front end and the back end, the culture has been removed

1423
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,800
so far at this point that an individual program are coming from, it

1424
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,000
could probably hardly be blamed for not knowing or even caring about

1425
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,700
these things because they're in no position to ever have learned or

1426
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,800
ever affect right?

1427
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:05,200
These things that people who program games at a low level would take

1428
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,000
for granted.

1429
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,900
And just be like, of course, you have to know these things.

1430
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,600
And of course, you can assure 60 frames a second and blah, blah blah,

1431
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,100
right?

1432
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,200
That said, do I think there's a fair bit of shared delusion, they're

1433
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,700
certainly and the reason that I say that is because oftentimes I have

1434
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,600
asked web programmers.

1435
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,300
I'm like, why is this thing?

1436
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:29,900
So slow and they're like, well, you know, the round trip of packets is

1437
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,500
like 200 milliseconds or something.

1438
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,100
So, you know, it doesn't really matter.

1439
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,300
You know, if I take an extra 100 milliseconds to do something that

1440
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,900
could have taken, one millisecond, doesn't matter.

1441
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:43,400
And, you know, I've had the experience actually, very recently of

1442
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,200
having some say, I mean I was like, actually,

1443
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,800
We if I ping like Google server for example from my machine it's a 1

1444
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:51,800
ms, ping time.

1445
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:58,400
So I'm like actually if you took less than 15 milliseconds to process

1446
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,800
whatever I was doing.

1447
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,800
This would be a 60 frames per second app, right?

1448
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,500
And this was like a real Revelation to this person when I said it, you

1449
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,700
can see that their brain kind of went like, whoa, wait a minute,

1450
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:11,300
right?

1451
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:16,200
And I think that, so yet at the same time, even though the it's super

1452
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:16,800
crafty

1453
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,800
I think there also is sort of a shared delusion that's been brought

1454
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,700
into this point.

1455
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,600
That somehow they believe that there is no way to make these things

1456
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,300
fast when actually the network is no longer a problem like to a large

1457
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,500
number of people's homes.

1458
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,900
You could actually deliver 60 frames a second web apps that were still

1459
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,300
running off of a server client model.

1460
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,200
And the reason that you're not is because

1461
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,800
Nobody in the chain cared about doing that but the could have its it

1462
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,000
ain't the link layer anymore like it just isn't right.

1463
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:54,100
And so I think one thing that would be nice to your quite point of

1464
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,000
like, what can be done?

1465
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,500
Is it would be nice at some point to start getting out there and

1466
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:02,700
saying, hey, look web apps actually can run at 60 frames a second,

1467
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,300
even the Ping, because a lot of places, there's one millisecond ping

1468
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,100
times, right?

1469
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,700
And sure there will be people who have 200 millisecond ping times but

1470
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,000
that's okay, that's no excuse.

1471
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,800
Having all the people who don't have a bad experience.

1472
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,700
Internalizing that might be a good first step in going.

1473
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,000
What do we need to do?

1474
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,700
To all the rest of this stuff to get it to the point where it's

1475
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,200
actually realizing that goal?

1476
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:39,300
Empire Tycoon.

1477
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,200
Okay, so I'm at.

1478
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,000
This is going to be the, the last question.

1479
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,200
I'll take since the Q&A is technically over because this is the

1480
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,700
follow-up to the one where I asked for more clarification.

1481
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,300
So on the person who said they were getting stuck and I asked, what

1482
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,000
does that mean?

1483
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:56,900
Here is the explanation.

1484
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:00,800
For example, one day, I decide to write a small game in an engine but

1485
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,000
instead of doing that, I spent the whole day reading through the

1486
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,700
engine documentation and video tutorials by the end of the day, I got

1487
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,000
nothing.

1488
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,100
Accomplished and got burned out on it.

1489
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:16,600
Okay, so two possible reasons for this and I will give them to you,

1490
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:17,300
right?

1491
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:20,600
One.

1492
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,100
Is that you aren't good at programming, right?

1493
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,800
Always the possibility, right?

1494
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,400
Like I said, we have no idea, right?

1495
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,100
It's possibility.

1496
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:29,500
One

1497
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,500
But we have no idea if that's true yet.

1498
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,000
So I'd say, put that one aside.

1499
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,500
Possibility to is you are picking things that are too big a scope for

1500
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,000
what you should be working on right now.

1501
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,900
And typically you know with what you just said, I would say that that

1502
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,400
is almost always the problem.

1503
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,600
So

1504
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:58,900
A game engine or a game either or are two very big and difficult

1505
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,600
problems.

1506
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,600
Right.

1507
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:05,300
Nobody who isn't very competent at programming, and has had a lot of

1508
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:09,100
experience should really be doing either of those two things.

1509
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,100
Now, if you are going to go download, you know, Unity or something,

1510
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,000
and build a game in that and your game doesn't have very much game

1511
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,800
code to it.

1512
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,800
You may be able to just muddle through, right?

1513
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,100
It's entirely possible.

1514
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:29,900
But if you are trying to do something that has any code complexity

1515
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:33,600
whatsoever to it, often times, you'll get exactly the situation that

1516
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:34,400
you're just saying.

1517
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,600
You're like, I don't know, I read all the documentation and it was

1518
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,100
like I don't understand at all and there's too much and I got worried

1519
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,500
about these things, they were talking about, don't do this and do do

1520
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:43,700
that.

1521
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,000
And I don't know how to connect these.

1522
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,400
Two things out Bubba bomber, right?

1523
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:54,300
It is almost always the case that if you're having that kind of

1524
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:58,100
experience, you just need to step back and start with smaller things,

1525
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:58,800
right?

1526
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,700
Because your brain may not be ready yet to integrate all of that

1527
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:08,900
information about the existing engine and understand how you would

1528
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,300
proceed, right?

1529
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,500
So again, I would say, can you pick a very small much more achievable

1530
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,700
task and accomplish it, an example.

1531
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:21,400
B.

1532
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,700
You want to write a game in a game engine?

1533
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:28,000
That's the end goal, right?

1534
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You don't want to write the engine.

1535
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,400
You just want to write a game in that engine.

1536
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,700
It sounded like what you're talking about.

1537
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,100
You try doing that whole hog and you just you got it was too diffused

1538
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,500
and it just didn't happen, right?

1539
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,400
So, start with something much smaller.

1540
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:48,600
Today's goal is figure out how to render a sphere in this engine

1541
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:51,300
create a sphere and render the sphere.

1542
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That is all the goal for today is at the end of the day.

1543
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,200
I download Unity or whatever it is you were using.

1544
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,100
I download Unity.

1545
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:09,000
I read as only as much of a tutorial as is necessary to create one

1546
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:15,300
sphere and produce the execute Unity executable, that shows the

1547
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:15,900
sphere.

1548
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:22,100
This fear does not have to be shaded, it does not have to move, it

1549
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,900
does not have to do anything other than be a sphere on the screen.

1550
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,600
Okay.

1551
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:36,600
D to make the sphere go from one place to another.

1552
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:45,200
Just move like that right D3, make the sphere.

1553
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,000
Have a material like a color.

1554
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:51,200
D4.

1555
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,300
Make the sphere have a light.

1556
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,300
Those things may sound silly.

1557
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,200
When you think of them.

1558
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,400
But that is how you actually get better at these problems.

1559
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:08,900
You add and add and add, and add and add from small achievable goals.

1560
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,500
Because if you try to take something that's too big for, what your

1561
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,300
mind currently is facile with working with that is where you get that

1562
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,800
diffusion in that burnout, where you just like, I don't know what to

1563
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,200
do.

1564
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,100
I'm sitting here looking at this thing, but I don't know what to do,

1565
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,000
right?

1566
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,600
And there's too much stuff coming in.

1567
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,400
I'm too confused.

1568
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,900
I'm worried about this and worry about that.

1569
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:29,800
You sit down one day.

1570
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,800
Like I'm going to make a game in this game engine and somehow by the

1571
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,900
end of the day, you're what you're worrying about is how you will

1572
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:40,000
convince YouTube streamers to stream the game, so that it people will

1573
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,900
know about it and play it because otherwise it won't be successful,

1574
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:43,500
right?

1575
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,200
Somehow you've gotten your mind there and you don't even have like a

1576
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,300
project open and unity yet or something, right?

1577
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:56,500
So you can't, you you have to disengage that part of your brain that's

1578
01:21:56,500 --> 01:22:00,400
thinking about the long-term picture, you need to turn that off

1579
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:03,400
because what you're doing right now is you're learning, you're not

1580
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:09,600
executing your learning and learning is about picking small concrete

1581
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,700
goals that you can do in a finite amount of time.

1582
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:18,300
And know that you have finished make a game in an engine is completely

1583
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,100
undefined.

1584
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:27,600
Do you mean Assassin's Creed 4 metal of the Ancients or do you mean

1585
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,300
Tetris, right?

1586
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,700
Do you mean high quality Graphics or single little pixel art?

1587
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,300
Right?

1588
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,300
Is there music in this game?

1589
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,400
Are there images in this?

1590
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,500
Like, who knows?

1591
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,000
Right.

1592
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,800
That is not a learning experience.

1593
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,400
A learning experience is concrete.

1594
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I am going to make asteroids it will look exactly.

1595
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,400
Like the original asteroids in order to make the original asteroids.

1596
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:56,900
I know that.

1597
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:00,400
The first thing I will need to do is to be able to display an

1598
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,200
asteroid.

1599
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:01,900
Okay.

1600
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:06,100
Project for day one is, how do I display a square on the screen

1601
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,500
project for day two?

1602
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,800
How do I make that square?

1603
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,800
Show the shape of an asteroid.

1604
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,900
Right party for day three, move the asteroid.

1605
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,900
But if your day for two, asteroids products for day, 5 and asteroids,

1606
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,900
right?

1607
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,400
That is how it works.

1608
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,900
And nobody, you know, just sat down day one without ever having done

1609
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,100
anything before and made a great game, whether they downloaded an

1610
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,700
engine or not, right?

1611
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:43,200
And all of that goes, double triple quadruple times 10, whatever.

1612
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,200
If you're making the engine yourself, because we're making the engine

1613
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,600
yourself.

1614
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,600
You're now in a whole other class of technical competence that takes a

1615
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,000
lifetime to master.

1616
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,300
And so by the time you're going to think about making a game engine

1617
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,300
entirely by yourself.

1618
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,800
you need to have done a lot of work, and

1619
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,800
I know that that is a really important thing to you to want to do,

1620
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:04,400
right?

1621
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,400
So hopefully that answers the question, if that makes sense.

1622
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,400
And as strange as that might seem

1623
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:23,500
I would also like to point out, as if that seems overly pedantic even

1624
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:28,400
or not overly pedantic, but overly, like educational, even to you, I

1625
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,300
would even point out.

1626
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,200
The fact that look at what we do on handmade hero, when I go to make a

1627
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,400
change in the code base, notice I do the same thing, right?

1628
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,900
How many times have you heard me?

1629
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:42,600
Say, I'm taking this one step at a time and I will take a change.

1630
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,200
And this isn't make a game.

1631
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,400
This is I'm just making one change to the code base.

1632
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,300
I'll say here's the steps.

1633
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:49,700
I'm going to take to make it.

1634
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,500
Why?

1635
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,100
Because the more concrete and individualized and achievable, each step

1636
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:00,400
is that you make at any level of development, the easier it is to stay

1637
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,600
motivated.

1638
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,000
Ensure that it works.

1639
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,900
Do a good job, know that you completed and keep your project moving

1640
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,000
forward, right?

1641
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:14,600
And invariably anytime I ever get myself into a situation where I feel

1642
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,400
like I'm not making progress, the solution always turns out to be and

1643
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,300
I wish sometimes I even come at it to it way later than I really

1644
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,200
should have after 30 years, right.

1645
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,000
Is wait, you're spinning your wheels on this?

1646
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,400
Break it into smaller problems.

1647
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,000
What can you ship out of this, right?

1648
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,300
You've got this big thing, the asset system and you've trying stuff

1649
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,100
and it's not working.

1650
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,700
It's not coming out.

1651
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:38,800
What?

1652
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,000
Okay, stop.

1653
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,800
What are some things?

1654
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,000
You know, this will have to do ship those first.

1655
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:46,900
Okay?

1656
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,000
Now, they're taking out of the problem and now you have more

1657
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,600
visibility about what the rest of the solution has to look like,

1658
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:53,300
right.

1659
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,800
Grab

1660
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,600
Nothing to hold onto and ship it to grab the next thing and ship it,

1661
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,200
right?

1662
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:03,000
And that is how you make progress on those kinds of

1663
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,800
on those kinds of problems that are too big for you right now.

1664
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,300
And by the way, kind of like I just tried to elude to too big for you.

1665
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:16,300
Right now is something you will never outgrow, no matter how good you

1666
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,200
get it programming.

1667
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,600
There will always be a problem that's a little bit bigger than that.

1668
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,700
And when you go to attack that problem, this skill will come in.

1669
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:30,700
So handy learning to divide and conquer a problem.

1670
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,100
Never goes out of style, right?

1671
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:34,500
I

1672
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:40,700
Do it every day still, it is part of my development process and more

1673
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,300
often than not.

1674
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:45,600
When I am done with a section of code, one thing I will think to

1675
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,000
myself is that would have gone faster.

1676
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:54,400
If I had divided it up more sooner, I'm almost never say boy.

1677
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,000
I wish I had done those two parts together at the same time, right?

1678
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,700
Like that.

1679
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,600
Not a thing that happens in my world, right?

1680
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,900
And there are some techniques that you have to learn to employ

1681
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:10,000
architectural, e, to make sure that things fit together.

1682
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,000
That's the compression oriented program stuff.

1683
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
We talked about in the also, the writing usage code, first kinds of

1684
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,800
stuff there are techniques that make things fit together better.

1685
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,600
Those come with time and you do have to learn those when you want to

1686
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,100
start making like really good architecture stuff like that, but even

1687
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:29,200
before, you know, those you will still be more successful shipping

1688
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:29,900
things if you break them.

1689
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,400
Two pieces.

1690
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,900
It's just the pieces won't fit together as well as they should right.

1691
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,200
But you will still be more successful at getting stuff done.

1692
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,000
Even with that.

1693
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:39,500
Oops.

1694
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,200
I like wrote the renderer and it doesn't quite work, right?

1695
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:45,600
Because I didn't think about this binding, oh well, but you'll get em

1696
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
next time, right?

1697
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,600
And then over time, you'll learn the techniques.

1698
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,800
You need to try and minimize the degree to which you have that

1699
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,700
problem, right?

1700
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:53,800
So

1701
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:56,100
All right.

1702
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,700
Hopefully that is a pretty yeah, we're right at 6:30 so I'm going to

1703
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:03,400
sign off.

1704
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,600
That is a ridiculously long discussion of imposter syndrome and

1705
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,700
related issues.

1706
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:13,600
Hopefully it's useful to somebody if I was to have imposter syndrome

1707
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,600
right now I would say something like I don't know if this dream will

1708
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,700
be useful in anybody.

1709
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:20,500
Maybe I'm just talking randomly and none of this information is any

1710
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,400
good, but if we were trying to be more positive about me, like I'm

1711
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,100
I'm sure it'll help someone somewhere.

1712
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,400
Okay, that's about it.

1713
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,700
Thank you for joining me for another episode of handmade hero.

1714
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,700
I guess this wasn't really a.

1715
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,100
Handmade hero was technically a handmade chat so we will branded as

1716
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:36,400
such I guess on.

1717
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,900
When I upload the video I will be back here tomorrow at 8 p.m.

1718
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,100
it's an eight pm stream tomorrow.

1719
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:45,300
Hope to see you guys here for that until then everyone have fun

1720
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:47,600
programming and I will see you guys on the internet.

1721
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,500
Take it easy, everybody.
