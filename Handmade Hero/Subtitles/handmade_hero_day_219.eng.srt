00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,500
The show where we could have complete game live on stream, you know,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,700
we had a pretty depressing discussion in the free stream.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,800
I'm not going to lie to you.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,300
So this is kind of going to be, like, probably the most depressing

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,200
programming stream that we've had your own handmade hero.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I feel like we should all just accept that and, and, and try to wallow

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,200
in it as much as possible today is is day 219.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,500
one of the saddest numbers to 19, of course, was was the

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,200
I believe it was Gauss who said that it was the number that

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,100
encapsulates.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,700
The sadness, all of human suffering and he was right.

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,800
Because, of course, he's gross and I don't know anything.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,100
The cows was ever wrong about and so if you would like to follow along

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,800
with the Despair and tragedy of today's stream, you should unpack day,

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,300
218 source code into a directory, you should

17
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:19,000
Fertilize that directory with human tears and then you should see what

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,200
grows from it and it will probably be black roses that crumble and

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,400
Blow Away With The Wind that said, let's jump into it here we are in

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,000
the middle of the the debug system, of course, a system, which is

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
meant for catching problems.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,400
So the whole point of the existence of this system is because

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Was humans are so fallible and always do everything wrong.

24
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,900
So we're pretty much just programming right now, with the expectation,

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,700
that everything is bad and we need a system to prevent it from being

26
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,500
so horrible.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,700
So, let's go ahead and and look at where we're at.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,900
If you remember, we did our memory management stuff yesterday.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,700
So we now can store essentially unlimited debug information as it

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
streams in.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,900
And what happens is, when we run out of memory to store it, you can

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,200
basically say

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,100
How much memory you want to use for that process when we run out, it

34
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,100
will just recycle old memory and throwaway, sort of information that

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
is the oldest.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,700
And so, that's pretty great in the same way that anything can really

37
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,600
be great, which is to say that it is, but a fleeting edifice that will

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,900
crumble on the force of time.

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:56,200
And eventually will be nothing but a corroded statue face peeking up

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,500
above the Sands its body.

41
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,100
destroyed in crumbling covered beneath the

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,500
desert heaves.

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,600
So like I said, that's the debug system.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,700
So what we need to do now is start to pull everything back together.

45
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,900
You know, kind of like a sad child of a divorced family who just wants

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,500
some normalcy.

47
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,700
Again, we're just going to try and pull the pieces of our debug system

48
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
that we had made all separately.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,500
Sort of as we were trying to figure out how we wanted it to work.

50
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,300
Probably, you know, sort of like an awkward teenager who is unpopular

51
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,700
at school and just is trying to figure out, you know, how to be

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
themselves and will anyone ever love them?

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,700
We're going to go ahead and try to pull this together.

54
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,000
Now that we have a coherent idea of how things should be stored.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,500
So the first thing that I'd like to restore is our hierarchy, of

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,200
course, we're going to have things in a hierarchy.

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,900
Because it's easier to access things in a hierarchy, humans are used

58
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,400
to accessing a hierarchy but also because we really don't have any

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,800
other choice because humankind has evolved to keep things in a

60
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,600
hierarchy where the majority of the people are at the bottom and are

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,900
oppressed by the elements of the hierarchy that are higher up.

62
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
So let's go ahead and do that.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
We have all of these events stored.

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,500
And so what we need to do now is just build some user interface

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,000
elements on top of them that will place them into this hierarchy in a

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,700
rigid caste system that does not allow them any upward Mobility

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,600
whatsoever.

68
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,700
Unless the user who is all powerful should reach in and Dane it to be

69
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
so and transfer them around.

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,400
So, what we want to do here is we want to say that the first time that

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
we see an event type right?

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Because remember now we've

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Events coming in from locations in the code and those, you know, like

74
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,300
like very brief little beacons of light in a vast Sea Of Darkness need

75
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,200
to sort of get coalesced into streams based on where they came from,

76
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,700
right.

77
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,700
It's kind of like, it's basically like racism.

78
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,400
We don't consider them individually in any way.

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,400
We are cruel and superficial and we just take it and

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,200
We say, you came from this place.

81
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,800
We are going to put you here, no matter what you want it to be, no

82
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
matter who you are on the inside.

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,500
We just, we just plain don't care because our souls are devoid of

84
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,200
compassion.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,700
So when we get one of those events, we are putting them into these

86
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
places that we call debug elements.

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,700
So that the events kind of pile up that are all coming from that one

88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,200
place.

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,400
so, what we want to do there is we want to say the first time that we

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,900
create one

91
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,900
Elements.

92
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,600
If that element had hierarchical information in it, we would like to

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,900
organize it into the hierarchy, right?

94
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,200
That's what we would like to do.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
So I'm going to go ahead and try to make that happen.

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,700
We will probably fail because like all human endeavor, it's destined

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
for failure.

98
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,000
Shakespeare's tragedies were the true ones.

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,300
The comedies were mere fantasy.

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,200
That we could never hope to Aspire, sorry to, which we can never hope

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,800
to Aspire.

102
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,400
So I'm going to go ahead and say that, you know, we have these trees

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,200
obviously, and we sort of had the concept that these these trees have

104
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,300
those, those groups and all that sort of thing in there.

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to say that.

106
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,400
Let's let's make this root tree bit here.

107
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I don't know that we actually needed to be a tree.

108
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,100
I'm going to go back to the concept of the route group there.

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,100
I don't think there was any real reason we needed to stop calling it

110
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
that we can just say that there's a group and

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
That group is there because it's not really a tree per se.

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,700
It is just a group that we build and then if a tree wishes to view

113
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,300
that group, it can, if it doesn't want to, it does not have to.

114
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,100
So let's take a look.

115
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,200
At that process right here for the moment.

116
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,000
So, we have that route group and I'm just going to create it

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,200
synthetically, like we were doing before.

118
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm going to go ahead and start re-enabling those things that can

119
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
create the hierarchy.

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,700
Right?

121
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
And and so we've got you know basically everything we need here.

122
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
We just need to sort of rejuvenate it.

123
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
We need to make it sort of conform to our new system.

124
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,500
We need to be Pro crusties and say it doesn't really matter how these

125
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,000
functions may have wanted to be

126
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,800
What they aspire to or what their dreams are, we will place them on

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,300
the bed and saw off their limbs until they fit.

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,600
So, here is ADD variable to group and create variable group, right?

129
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,100
Create variable group is fairly straightforward.

130
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,700
I don't see any reason why create variable group, can't simply work,

131
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,400
the way that it was working before.

132
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,500
Again, a variable group, doesn't really have much in, it doesn't

133
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,700
really have anything other than sort of a linked list.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,100
So I feel like that's just fine, right?

135
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,200
It's just this and that should be fine.

136
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,700
So create variable group, probably doesn't really need to be changed

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,100
in any particular way, again, these are

138
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,300
Static stationary things so we can go ahead and allocate them in this

139
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,600
way right now.

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,500
In the future.

141
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,000
I do think and I suppose we kind of want to start doing this as well.

142
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,200
I do want these to kind of be free list based so I almost want to

143
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,900
start making these guys freely space but I think I'm going to push

144
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
that off for just a little bit.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,500
And in fact, we probably could push it off forever, to be honest

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,300
because we can just, you know, the amount of of interacting that the

147
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,100
users going to do.

148
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,600
With building debug States isn't really that much, you could, you

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,000
could even just leak the memory, it doesn't matter because the debug

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,500
system.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,300
But you know, for completeness later, we may want to actually make it

152
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,800
properly, recycle things as it goes.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Yeah.

154
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:15,100
Like just like pretty much all of the humans on planet Earth like they

155
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,400
don't really care about recycling till they absolutely have to.

156
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,600
And they'd rather just have everything pile up in a landfill until the

157
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Earth is completely destroyed and Barren.

158
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,400
So let's take a look here and variable to group.

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just going to

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,300
To look at how this was working.

161
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,100
So it looks like what we did here was we have the event stuff in that

162
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,700
got added.

163
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,500
And I think really the only change we have to make here is that now,

164
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,400
instead of thinking of things as having events that get added really,

165
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
what we're doing is we're adding elements.

166
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,800
So it's really going to be like add element to group, right?

167
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,800
And we're going to pass that element in.

168
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And the element is going to be the thing that we actually set.

169
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,200
Like, so,

170
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,700
Everything else I think is pretty much the same.

171
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,300
There really isn't anything else that needs to happen there?

172
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,500
I don't think so that should be fine.

173
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Now what I don't know is I'm not seeing anywhere here and I'm assuming

174
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,800
it's because we haven't implemented it yet in this in our last pass

175
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,600
through things.

176
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,500
But I'm not seeing anything here that deals with how one of these

177
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,800
groups could have children.

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,800
And I think, you know, this is just kind of one of those things where

179
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,400
it's Barren, it cannot sire a child.

180
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
Probably the only thing that it wanted was to be a parent, really?

181
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,600
But it was either born infertile or its mate was.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,500
And despite what they might have wished, they will never.

183
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,000
Have a family, they will just have to live out their life with that

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,100
emptiness and and despair.

185
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
So let's take a look at what I would have to do to make that happen as

186
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:58,500
well.

187
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Because here with create variable group and you can see that what it

188
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,700
does is it creates a variable group that does not have a parent.

189
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,900
It does not have children, right?

190
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,600
There is no.

191
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,700
Yeah, right?

192
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,100
It is essentially, it is both an orphan and and baron, it is both of

193
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,700
those things.

194
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
So, very

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,300
A difficult life.

196
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,600
Rather tragic.

197
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,300
Actually, if you think about it it is it is sort of both the Alpha and

198
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,000
the Omega and that sense it neither has a past nor Future.

199
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,500
IT exists only for a brief moment.

200
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,700
And then all trace of existence is gone and it's life is meaningless.

201
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,800
So let's let's see if there's something that we can do about that

202
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,600
because when we create a variable group, we're going to want to be

203
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,100
able to create a variable group underneath that variable group.

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,700
That's how we get a hierarchy, right?

205
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,600
We need to have children in the variable groups in order to make that

206
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,100
happen.

207
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,600
So when we create a variable group, I'm thinking that maybe we would

208
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,800
want to pass something in like, you know, do you have a parent who

209
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,400
You were expecting to be a part of, right?

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,000
Like are you, are you expecting to be a part of it?

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,400
Frank.

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
And so I'm just looking at how this would have gone inside, debug

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,000
variable group, we've got this tplot variable like this essential,

214
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,200
right?

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,900
It kind of comes through and you add these in here and if we just look

216
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,900
to see whether there's a group that needs to have children.

217
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
So when we do add element to group,

218
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,100
It's going to do this stuff here.

219
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,400
As you can see.

220
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,800
Go ahead and dive in there.

221
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,000
It's going to go do this stuff here, but we probably also want the

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,500
ability to do ad group to group, right?

223
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,500
We presumably want the ability to do ad group to group like so, so we

224
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,700
can go ahead and get

225
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,600
All that in here.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,300
So this would be the same thing.

227
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,800
We'd add a link, we would insert the link, but in this time, we

228
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
wouldn't insert it into the 08.

229
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,700
And we would insert it into the group, Sentinel whatever group were

230
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,500
going, we then would set the link up.

231
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,700
But this time we would, we would do the opposite of what we're doing

232
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,100
here.

233
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,400
We would set the children to be children here.

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,900
So this is I guess I should say.

235
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,200
Group.

236
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,700
And then we would really not need to do any of that stuff.

237
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
That's this is all meaningless.

238
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,000
In fact, it started as well.

239
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
So that's all that is.

240
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,700
I'm trying to think whether this is the, is this, did we already vet

241
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,000
this structure properly?

242
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,300
The fact that there's a pointer this is this is sort of like a, you

243
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,900
know, it can either have a group or it can have a set of elements.

244
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, or can have an element that seems reasonable

245
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,700
But I would point out something here.

246
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,400
That strikes me as a little bit odd, which is that if you have a debug

247
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,600
variable group and there's a children pointer, I don't see any place

248
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,500
you can where you get, you know the name, right?

249
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,300
So you know, we've got these

250
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,200
We've got these hierarchies now if we wanted to but there is no way to

251
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,300
know what it was.

252
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,900
So I feel like this here, you know, I feel like you'd normally have

253
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,400
some kind of a name that this group would have and I suppose it's just

254
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:33,000
goes to show you how you know dehumanizing we really are when we just

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,600
don't even care what as far as we're concerned you just have an

256
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,200
address we just have a number you're nothing but a number in a system

257
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,000
and

258
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,600
We don't care about you, we don't care about your individuality as far

259
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
as we're concerned.

260
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
You're just here to serve the purpose for which you were created and

261
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:58,900
there is no, there's no real soul to you, we are uninterested in that.

262
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,900
So let's take a look.

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,300
Here.

264
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,600
So we've got this is this would be parent, I suppose.

265
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,000
So, let's take a look here.

266
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,200
So parents Sentinel and here, I think probably we would want to do

267
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,800
parent as well.

268
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Just to be clear about what's happening there.

269
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
That seems reasonable to me.

270
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,800
Go ahead and compile that so that all compiles relatively well.

271
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
And, and I think that's mostly everything.

272
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,800
We would need at least to start adding things and creating groups now.

273
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Unfortunately, like I said, we still need one more piece.

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Piece of the puzzle which is that we need ways of figuring out where

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,900
in the hierarchy things should go.

276
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,200
And so we need to do that part as well, which we will do in a second,

277
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,300
but for the moment,

278
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,400
I create variable, I think it's something that we don't ever need

279
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,700
because we're always just going to be adding elements at the moment.

280
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
So I feel like that's and it's all code.

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,700
That kind of irrelevant for what we were used to be doing as far as I

282
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,600
can tell as well.

283
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't see really any part of that that needs to stay.

284
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,800
So I'm just going to get rid of that as well.

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,600
We have free variable group, that's not implemented yet and that's

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,000
fine.

287
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,900
We can leave that there and and still leave it as not.

288
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,000
Wanted, should we ever free one of these?

289
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, we'll get that and we'll go do it.

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,900
And I think this is both not relevant anymore.

291
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,100
And so really, the only thing that we need to deal with now is this

292
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,200
and it's still actually the sort of the the correct thing to do this

293
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
correct call we just never implement it, right?

294
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,200
Because we were sort of busy with other things.

295
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,100
So that's really the part that will have to do to finally make things

296
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,500
work.

297
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Let me double check your

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,700
You're what we were doing by just sort of doing the same thing we were

299
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,500
doing before and having a temporary sort of thing.

300
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,700
Like that and then we'll focus on implementing this guy.

301
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,000
It won't be particularly hard.

302
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,500
It just took be a bit of typing.

303
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay.

304
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,099
So that's what we've got so far.

305
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,200
And so, what I want to do now is I just want to actually start calling

306
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,300
these guys in the appropriate places.

307
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,400
So, you know, we've got when we create our debug State at the

308
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
beginning, right?

309
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,700
We've got our sort of initialized tips, that's spelled wrong.

310
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,000
And so in here, when we initialize everything, we're going to want to

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,900
do, you know what this is interesting?

312
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,600
We still want any of this stuff.

313
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,900
I don't know if you still wind stuff, but at the outset, obviously,

314
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,100
we're going to want to do something where we take that route group,

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,500
And we actually create a variable group there, right?

316
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:52,600
And if I go in to create variable group and I look at it, pretty much

317
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,900
all I need to do is pass that debug State, and that'll go.

318
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
So now I've got a route group and that's ready to go.

319
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,600
So, now I should be able to

320
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,500
This up and I should be able to add things hierarchically into this

321
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,600
group and be good to go, right?

322
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,200
So let's take a look at Co ladybug records.

323
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
And if we look at store events, I think that's where all the magic

324
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,500
would happen when we go to store an event.

325
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,600
When we hope.

326
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,800
Sorry, not story, bang.

327
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,300
It's actually get element from event right here.

328
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,900
When we go to get an element from an event, you can see that when we

329
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,100
get to a time when we see an event for the first time that comes from

330
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,300
something, we didn't understand, you can see us kind of getting it

331
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,700
here where we're like, oh right, we didn't know where this was from.

332
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,100
We need to create one and put it in the hash table.

333
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,400
That's the time when we now want to do the hierarchical look up.

334
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Now, the thing that I don't really know here,

335
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,800
Is we sort of introduced the system that was based on underscores for

336
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,700
finding these.

337
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,800
Not all of our stuff necessarily follows that the moment and we kind

338
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
of have that block pain thing.

339
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,600
So what I'm going to do for now because I'm just going to say let's

340
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
just treat everything the same way and we'll see what happens and then

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,600
we'll kind of go through and think about it a little bit more as we

342
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,100
start to integrate the other parts in.

343
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
So what happens here is we're in a situation where we

344
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,300
Received an event.

345
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,100
We know that are that are

346
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,000
Our code has this block named thing and we know at least at the moment

347
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,400
that block name was what we want to use to file it.

348
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,300
Now we might remove it and which case we'll just always use grid to

349
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,800
file to do a filing.

350
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,500
But then we would also have to think about how we want to do grids to

351
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
actually create the hierarchy.

352
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,000
So

353
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,800
we definitely have some thinking to do.

354
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,000
And I think there's probably some stuff we need to do that, you know,

355
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,500
to fix a few things that are that probably want to be fixed as we get

356
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:05,100
this going and specifically that would be that while our debug value

357
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,500
what we call them are well our debug variables, all have those little

358
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,900
names when we gave them like, you know, ground chunks underscore

359
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,500
checkerboard or whatever.

360
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,200
Well, those make sense, the other things like, where we were dumping

361
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,900
debug data, we probably want that all to use the same unified concept,

362
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,800
but it won't be and just, you know, again.

363
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,300
So, you know, kind of what I'm thinking about and we're on the same

364
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,100
page, you're not like, what's he saying?

365
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,400
You remember, we have like this stuff here where we can say, like

366
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,900
begin data block and you can see this thing and then we sort of push

367
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,800
out all these values, right?

368
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,000
So, what I'm saying is that these

369
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,600
Youse are all coming from locations in the code that are bracketed by

370
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,100
this data.

371
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,200
Block thing, we probably want them filed under a data block.

372
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
That's created in this in this thing, right?

373
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,800
That's probably how we would want them to go.

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,400
You I wise and so we're probably going to have to once we get this

375
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,700
working, do a little bit more in terms of just like thinking about how

376
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,800
we want to produce the hierarchical structure of these things.

377
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,600
In order to make it do what we actually wanted to do.

378
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,400
So I'm just going to start by doing the basic version but I think

379
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,800
we're going to want to level it up a little bit to get the really

380
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,400
good.

381
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,300
Sweet action.

382
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,900
Don't know why.

383
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,400
We would be getting sweet action on a day.

384
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
That's all about depression and failure.

385
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,300
But sometimes there is a brief, you know, a slight ray of sunshine

386
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,400
peeks through the clouds before being squashed and choked by the

387
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,300
swirling Darkness.

388
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,500
So let's let's go ahead and take a look at that when I go here and

389
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,300
find a result for the first time when that's not there anymore.

390
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,100
What I want to do is I want to do is that get harp goal, you know, get

391
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,000
whatever that, whatever that was.

392
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, it's group for hierarchical name, that's what I want to do.

393
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,300
So I want to to place the sky in the hierarchy.

394
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,900
So what I want to do is say all right, so I want to find its parent

395
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,400
group.

396
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,900
And I'm going to do that by passing that name in which is the block

397
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,400
name, that's going to.

398
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,300
Give me the group that I feel like this guy should be at to, which

399
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,700
this guy should be added sorry, tranquilo tongue twister there and so

400
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,700
then all I'm going to do at that point is I'm just going to add it,

401
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,500
right?

402
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm just going to say.

403
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,300
All right, I've got the element.

404
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,800
So now I'm going to add that element in like so I guess I don't

405
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,500
actually need to store

406
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,100
Swing for any particular reason, I'm going to add that into the where

407
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,200
the palate parent group is and that's it, right?

408
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,200
And that's really all I wanted to do if that's not a result event.

409
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,400
That's really all I wanted to do, right?

410
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,200
And I'm going to go ahead and again, Force the drawing of this thing

411
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,700
which I believe groups like we were doing before us.

412
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,100
So we can see what we're creating as we as we create it.

413
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,700
So we can start to get our little hierarchical placement thing working

414
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,300
properly.

415
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,100
Of course, I don't remember where any of that code is but you know,

416
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
sometimes you just don't remember.

417
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,500
Running the code is

418
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,700
Deal.

419
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,800
So let's take a look.

420
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,700
I believe it's.

421
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,300
Here we go.

422
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,400
It's right in here.

423
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,700
So when we're doing this tree group here, again, what I can do is just

424
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,900
do the same thing that I was doing before where I could just say, like

425
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,700
you know what,

426
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,900
Do we ever create?

427
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,800
The tree.

428
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,700
Can't we just create a tree down here and make that tree.

429
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,200
Always point to our route group?

430
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,100
That seems like the easiest way to get started.

431
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,700
So it's not.

432
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,900
It doesn't have to be hacky.

433
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,200
We kept hacking it in there, but there's really no need for that.

434
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,400
Where's the tree?

435
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, here we go.

436
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,400
Perfect.

437
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,100
So now I believe oh that was not what I was expecting.

438
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,400
It looks like there's things in our hierarchy that we don't know how

439
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,000
to draw, which I suppose is understandable, because now we're adding

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,600
just about everything in there, but we want to be able to handle that.

441
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,800
So we should probably go ahead and make sure it says and we started a

442
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
whole half-hour late today, so this five-minute warning is completely

443
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,400
meaningless.

444
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,500
Just like

445
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,700
Existence, so let's see.

446
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,600
Here we have debug event to text.

447
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,100
We're passing this event.

448
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,700
I don't want locals, I want my watch window.

449
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,900
So let's take a look at what the event actually is.

450
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,800
Here it is.

451
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
We've got a type of 6.

452
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,900
So let's take a look at what that event type means.

453
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,200
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so that's just a marked debug value.

454
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And so we can easily again make make make a our system handle that.

455
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,800
And we probably just should there's no sense in not doing it.

456
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,300
So here we have debug event to text which I believe is where we were.

457
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,700
We were flailing before.

458
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I'm just going to go ahead and make this print that out anyway.

459
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,700
And in fact I feel like what we could

460
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:52,300
You as well is just do something like this where we actually just do

461
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,000
you know?

462
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,700
That which I see which I feel like is totally reasonable.

463
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,200
And what we would pass there is just that block name

464
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,300
You know I'm saying.

465
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,800
So I'm just going to let that go for now and we'll see, we'll see what

466
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,400
we get.

467
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,900
So, let's continue on here.

468
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,300
I don't actually know, I'm kind of surprised that all that stuff

469
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,500
worked just without us, actually doing anything.

470
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,600
That's kind of amusing.

471
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,200
You know, sometimes in, even in the depths of Despair, some little

472
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,500
tiny thing goes your way.

473
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,000
And the important thing to remember is not to let that go to your

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,500
head.

475
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Things are still absolutely.

476
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:49,500
As bad as you thought they were and a minor Victory is no reason to

477
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,300
change your highly pessimistic outlook on the inevitability of human

478
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,800
suffering.

479
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,000
So,

480
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,700
Let's take a look here at what we've actually.

481
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
One thing that's a little bit strange to me, is I realize, I'm not

482
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,300
actually seeing any of our debug variables, and I don't know why, I'm

483
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,900
not seeing any of our debug variables, if I would have expected to see

484
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,300
some of our debug variables, but I guess I am not internalizing

485
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,700
correctly, how those things flow through the system because I'm seeing

486
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
all of our debug data showing up, but not our debug variables, which

487
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:28,500
is a little bit off right now that maybe because we don't print them

488
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,900
out.

489
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,000
Like I don't know if we

490
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,400
Them intentionally or something like this, that's certainly possible.

491
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,300
But I want to be able to see them so I want to go ahead and see why

492
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,700
we're not getting those first before I do anything else.

493
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,100
So, here is debug event to text.

494
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,700
Well, here's debug dropping menu.

495
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,800
So here we go.

496
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,800
When we switch on the IDS, it looks like it tries to print out just

497
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,400
about everything besides the bitmap ID and the counter thread list.

498
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,100
So in theory, I think that anything that was there

499
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,500
Should presumably be handled through the system.

500
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,200
So, I feel like that means that we must not be adding them at all, if

501
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,000
that makes sense.

502
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,900
And I'm not sure why we wouldn't be adding them, because it feels like

503
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,900
are pretty much everything should be added, right?

504
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,800
When we do Co ladybug records, pretty much everything that's in the

505
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,700
debug stream.

506
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,100
I feel like should be getting processed right here, right?

507
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,600
And so it seems to me that all of those debug values should also.

508
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,300
So be happening that way.

509
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,600
Now, let's take a look.

510
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,200
So I feel that's, yeah, I don't know why.

511
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,200
I don't know why that wouldn't be happening.

512
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,000
So there's begin block, end block, copa-data block, close data block,

513
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,600
I don't know, I don't know why.

514
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,100
We wouldn't be getting that.

515
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,800
So I think I might want to take a look at that because event type Mark

516
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
debug value.

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,100
That is.

518
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,600
And we even know that that was coming through because we even cat a

519
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,000
request to print one out, right?

520
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,000
In fact, that's this one.

521
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,500
Is it not?

522
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,300
So we know that at least, one, debug value is getting hit, but for

523
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,200
some reason, it has no block name.

524
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,200
So things things are a little wonky, right?

525
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Things are a little bit strange.

526
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,800
So, I'm going to take a look at what's coming through, Mark, debug

527
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,100
value.

528
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,400
I think that's what I want to do.

529
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,600
You know?

530
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,700
I mean, again, like what I want to do is just cry, I want to just weep

531
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,500
openly.

532
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,500
I want to break down in tears.

533
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
I want to

534
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,800
Just give up and let the Horrors.

535
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
The world.

536
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,300
Continue unabated but instead what I'm going to do is set a breakpoint

537
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,300
on Mark debug value.

538
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,600
So let's take a look at which ones we're getting here.

539
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,800
We are getting.

540
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,000
So the block name is set to 0 so I guess I must just not set the block

541
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,200
names for some reason but we're getting code handmade, debug interface

542
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,300
of H2, 93.

543
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,600
So that's

544
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,000
That's a bummer right, I think because that's not what we actually

545
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
would probably want to have happen.

546
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,900
And so I think I know I think I can see exactly what's going on here

547
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,200
and that's, that's a bummer.

548
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,500
So what's happening is because we call debug initialized value here,

549
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
everything

550
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,600
Is going to come from the same location, the code is going to come

551
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,200
right here.

552
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,600
So I think with that implies is that we would somehow have to make

553
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,800
everything happen in a macro there or at the very least, we have to

554
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,600
have

555
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,700
You know, we have to have this this part right here.

556
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,700
We have would have to have it generate a different grid.

557
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,100
Now, what we could do is use the name for the grid.

558
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,100
Right, that would work this.

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,100
Would presumably work.

560
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,800
Oops.

561
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,400
At least that's my that's my assertion.

562
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,400
I don't actually know but that's my assertion and hey it does and you

563
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,900
can kind of see that happening there but what that also means is that

564
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,500
we probably want to store the block name in this event as well.

565
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,300
There we go.

566
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,100
Wait a minute but I just did a vent grid equals grid.

567
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,200
What is the grid that's getting past their?

568
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,100
Oh so that was just a straight up that was just we had already thought

569
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,700
of that and we just kind of failed.

570
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,800
So all right.

571
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,700
That's actually not so bad.

572
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,900
So here is a slightly more reasonable version of this.

573
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Although I'm not sure.

574
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,700
I also see exactly why this is looking the way it is, but at least

575
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,600
we're getting more of the variables that we thought we were going to

576
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,000
get.

577
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,600
Now.

578
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Like I said, the unhandled thing there.

579
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
What's going on there?

580
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,900
I want to see what is happening.

581
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,100
Why are we getting

582
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,400
Stuff before the unhandled, right?

583
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,900
You can kind of see here that we're getting a bunch of information

584
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,100
before the unhandled and I guess that's because we're actually

585
00:32:59,100 --> 00:32:59,800
printing out

586
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,800
We must be doing the add name here where we're printing out, whatever

587
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,900
the name is of this guy, right?

588
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,000
The event block name.

589
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,900
We're printing out here so I guess that's why we're seeing two of

590
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,200
them.

591
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,500
But anyway, we can deal with that a little bit later.

592
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,000
So, this actually.

593
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Now, when we look at it, you can kind of see that we now at least know

594
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,200
that we're getting the data that we expect to be getting here is all

595
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,300
our debug variables.

596
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,700
And so now what we want to do is organize these into a hierarchy,

597
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,300
right?

598
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,100
and,

599
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,100
In order to do this, what we want to do again is like dissect that

600
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,400
name that comes in and use the underscore to tell us how the hierarchy

601
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
should be self-assembling, right?

602
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
That was what we decided to do.

603
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,700
For those of you who don't remember what we decided was 0, because we

604
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
want these things to sort of work and compile out and do those sorts

605
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,300
of things.

606
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:02,900
We had stuff, like, debug, if simulation you space at lines, we just

607
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,700
built the hierarchy into the name.

608
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,300
So underscore is essentially.

609
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,800
Like a slash almost that like says that you know, simulation is the

610
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,500
group it's under and used space outlines is the you know is the actual

611
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,000
value.

612
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,800
That's what that is right?

613
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So now we just need some way of actually parsing that and you know

614
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,900
doing the right thing.

615
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,199
In order to do that, we can just go to our get group for harp go name

616
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,900
instead of always returning the route group.

617
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,699
We now just need to actually look at the name and return a group that

618
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,300
is actually correct, right?

619
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
So let's do that.

620
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,300
The first thing we want to do is we want to take a look at this name

621
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:52,300
and we want to, I think scan the name for that underscore, right?

622
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,100
So we probably want to do something like

623
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,800
First underscore equals 0 and then we want to do you know something

624
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:10,600
like car stars and equals name scan is valid plus plus can so just run

625
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,400
through the string like so?

626
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,700
And then I think what we want to do is say all right.

627
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,600
excuse me, if the the value

628
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,600
Is the underscore?

629
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm going to set first underscore to scan and then I'm going to break,

630
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,600
right?

631
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,200
So we're just running through the screen, the string and finding the

632
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,400
first underscore that we see there.

633
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,600
And once we have that first underscore, we sort of know, we sort of

634
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,200
have a bracketed region that is the the substring if you will.

635
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,400
That's the first sort of hierarchical group under under which we

636
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,300
should place this guy.

637
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,900
so, what we want to do here is say, well,

638
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,000
The first underscore actually was valid, then we know there is a

639
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
hierarchical Miss to this thing.

640
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,500
If it's not then there's nothing there's no more hierarchy to do.

641
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:17,300
So we would just want to insert the thing into whatever its parent

642
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,600
was.

643
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
So I think we want to do something like this.

644
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,100
And so we would want to say, like okay, debug variable group result,

645
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,900
just equals whatever the parent is, the thing passed in, right?

646
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:38,200
And then what we'd want to do is say if there is a first underscore,

647
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,100
we keep going, otherwise we just return the result because if we

648
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,100
didn't find underscore we don't need to do any more work

649
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,900
hierarchically.

650
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,800
If we found that underscore, then what we want to do.

651
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,700
Say okay, we now need to see whether or not a group already exists

652
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,700
for, you know, underneath this parent that I can file the sky in and

653
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,400
if it doesn't, I need to create one.

654
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,800
So I need to do something like, get or create group with name or

655
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,700
something like this, right?

656
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
And that's just going to be okay.

657
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:18,000
I know it's going to be first underscore - name, that's how long the

658
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,700
group name is.

659
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
Is, I know it's under this parent.

660
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,300
And I know it starts here so I'm just passing them, the substring and

661
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,500
saying I need you to give me that group, right?

662
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,500
That that you found when I get that group this is like the subgroup

663
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,700
that we should be filed under.

664
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,600
Then I'm just going to say like okay the result I can just call myself

665
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,200
again, right?

666
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
I can recur ass down here and say like you know what?

667
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,300
Now let's just take the next part of the name.

668
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,200
So first underscore R plus 1, take that next part of the name and keep

669
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,700
going.

670
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,200
Right.

671
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,800
Just just keep going.

672
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,600
And that should do everything I needed to do.

673
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,200
So as long as I can do this operation.

674
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,600
Oops.

675
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,300
As long as I can do this operation somehow.

676
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,600
I should be fine.

677
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,800
The only kicker is that I don't have a null terminated name anymore.

678
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,900
I have a name that has a particular length to it, right?

679
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,300
Which is generally how I prefer to do strings anyway, but it's not how

680
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,400
we generally do swings on handmade hero because we don't really do

681
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
that much with strings.

682
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,200
So, it's not that big a deal.

683
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,800
But anyway, what we want to do here is we just want to search through

684
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,300
the parent to see whether or not we can find something that has the

685
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,000
same name.

686
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,300
So I just all I need to do here is I just need to Loop through that

687
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,500
that sort of list.

688
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,000
And remember, get group for heart girl, named is not a performance

689
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
critical function in any way.

690
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
So we don't really have to worry too much about

691
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,500
The only happens sort of when debug things are first coming in.

692
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,400
And then once the hierarchy set up, it never does this anymore because

693
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,900
it's only actually activates, what it sees, a new debug location, come

694
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,100
through that, it's never seen before.

695
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,700
That's the only time this stuff even gets called.

696
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,800
So even in the kind of the debug system, it's not even performance

697
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,600
critical.

698
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,400
Never mind the fact that the whole thing is also in the debug system.

699
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,900
So it's super doesn't matter at all which is kind of nice because it

700
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,400
means we don't have to do anything fancy or be too concerned about

701
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,900
what happens.

702
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,300
He's here.

703
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,500
So what we want to do is we want to Loop over these debug links.

704
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,500
Right?

705
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:42,500
And that's going to go by taking whatever that parent is, we're going

706
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,900
to do to me.

707
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,000
We've got a parent group, we want to take the Sentinel and we want to

708
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
look at its next pointer, right?

709
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,800
We're going to go until we hit the essential again and we're just

710
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,500
going to change.

711
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,000
So all we want to do is say, if the name matches on these guys, then

712
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,900
we found it.

713
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,400
And we're good.

714
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,700
Pretty straightforward there.

715
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,200
Otherwise we have to create a new one.

716
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,900
So we don't really know what this quite is yet.

717
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
We'll deal with that in one second.

718
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
But again, we do know what happens here.

719
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,500
If we don't have one of these, then we just need to create one, right?

720
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,900
So we need to create our little group here.

721
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,600
And then we also want to add ad group to group.

722
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,200
So again, pretty straightforward there, but the problem is we don't

723
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
have any way of doing this and you'll notice like, I sort of foretold

724
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:07,600
this like a grim prophecy where the world ends and everyone dies.

725
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:18,000
I said this day would come and like all prophecies that foretell the

726
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,500
end times.

727
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Of course, it comes true right?

728
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,200
On schedule.

729
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,200
And debug variable group does not currently have a name.

730
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,500
It needs one because without a name, we can never create a hierarchy

731
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,000
and we can't even we couldn't even display one if we did have it,

732
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,500
right?

733
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,600
We just have a bunch of pluses that we expand that don't actually have

734
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:35,900
names.

735
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,700
That's hardly very useful.

736
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,800
So I think we want to say here that

737
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
Going to do that.

738
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,600
So now that we have a way of storing those names in there and using

739
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,000
them.

740
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,600
So what I'd like to do is say that when we call create variable group,

741
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,100
we passed the name length in the name and it stores it.

742
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,700
And then, that way, we can now also do a string compare to see whether

743
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,800
the names match

744
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,700
And other things of this nature.

745
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,500
So the first thing we want to do is say, does the link is the link a

746
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,900
group thing and if it is does it match.

747
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:17,500
So we would want to say length strings are equal or something like

748
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,400
this and we would want to pass.

749
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,700
Okay, link children named length, link, children name and name, length

750
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,600
name.

751
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,100
Like so.

752
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,800
That's pretty much all we would need to do there.

753
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,400
We would need to do and create variable group.

754
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,000
We would want to do something like this where we just have name length

755
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,100
and name.

756
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,500
And so when we initialize one of these we give it a name.

757
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,500
And off you go.

758
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,700
So strings are equal.

759
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,200
We haven't written yet.

760
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,600
Create variable group.

761
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,700
Identifiers are not found.

762
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,700
That's probably because we need this to be in a slightly different

763
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,200
place.

764
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,500
So we need all these guys.

765
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,100
It's guys need to move.

766
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,100
Doot doot, doot do do doot up here except

767
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,200
And this is a, you 32 trust me.

768
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,700
My strings will never be more than 4 million characters long.

769
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,900
If they are more than 4 million characters long, I think we would have

770
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,300
a hard time displaying them on the screen, I can tell you that, so

771
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,200
let's see, get group for hierarchical.

772
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,700
Okay, so the first time we call get group for hierarchical name,

773
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,300
obviously, it's a recursive function now so we need to start it off

774
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,500
with the route group.

775
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,800
So it knows that it's kind of, at the base of the hierarchy.

776
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,000
So, that's easy enough.

777
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,800
And and then, of course, this one.

778
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,300
Well, you know, what I could call it root

779
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,600
I wanted to.

780
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,100
That's about it.

781
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,200
Okay, so I think all we need to do now is Implement a strings are

782
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,700
equal?

783
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,800
I don't remember where strings are equal was we wrote one for just the

784
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,500
regular string compare but I don't remember where I put it, okay, we

785
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,200
put it right here.

786
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,400
So what I need to do is I need to make a string compare that that uses

787
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,600
lengths, instead of null termination.

788
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,000
And so that's just like,

789
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,300
This sort of a thing.

790
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,300
And just we can even make it so that this can compare strings that

791
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,500
happen to be as long as can fit in memory.

792
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,900
There's not a particular reason not to do it, so we easily could do

793
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,000
it.

794
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,700
We might as well.

795
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,400
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to say that the result

796
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,700
is probably going to be equal to.

797
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,800
Well I guess a equals B is a fine.

798
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,300
Is a reasonable enough thing to set it.

799
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,300
I'm not sure why we did that way originally but

800
00:44:59,400 --> 00:44:59,800
I think what?

801
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,100
She want to do is say if a length equals B length, then we know that

802
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,800
we actually, you know, have something to work with here, otherwise the

803
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,700
result is false.

804
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,400
So I think probably that's what I would start with.

805
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,600
I'd say the lengths have to be equal, so if that is true, then we can

806
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,300
continue.

807
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,300
Right?

808
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,600
So assuming those links are equal, we can do something like this.

809
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,900
Okay, where we say all right?

810
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,700
Index, equals zero, index is less than a length and we know that the

811
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,300
lengths are equal if we're in this at all, right.

812
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,100
I mean, I'm basically saying, hey, if the lengths are equal, then

813
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,200
obviously, the strings aren't equal because they're different lengths.

814
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:45,900
So duh?

815
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,400
Right then I'm saying, all right, Loop over the a length because since

816
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,800
they're equal now a length or be lengths, are the same value, we don't

817
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,300
have to care.

818
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
So we Loop over both of them, right?

819
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,700
And I guess what I would say is,

820
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,900
Are we would just go result assume true.

821
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,900
And if anything doesn't match, we set to false and break.

822
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,100
All right, so what I do here is say if a index is not equal to B and

823
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,500
X, then we're done.

824
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:25,500
Okay, so that's roughly where we're at now.

825
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
This is not quite going to work for us at the moment.

826
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,200
If I am correct because what, we debug drug main menu, we don't

827
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:44,400
actually have any way at the moment of drawing, like the actual group

828
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,500
headers, right?

829
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,500
I mean, we didn't really do that and this code is kind of

830
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,400
All weird and wonky but so you can see we're kind of coming through

831
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:52,700
here.

832
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,900
We're looping over things and we say like okay when we get to one of

833
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,600
these things, we say debug variable and here is the link, we say

834
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:04,700
dipping a get event from link, but it might have been a group, right?

835
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,600
It might have been a group, so you can see that it's doing if link

836
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,800
children kind of a thing here, right?

837
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,900
So if event is not a particularly

838
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,000
that's,

839
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,600
I don't really know what we want to do about that because we want sort

840
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,500
of the ability to do either or right.

841
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,300
So I think probably what we want to do is say something more like

842
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,900
up front, we want to say like you know, if the link has children

843
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,000
Then we're going to process it in a hierarchical way, right?

844
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,900
And I think since both of these use we could use the link like so I

845
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,400
think we could just do this.

846
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,100
well, I guess we can always just

847
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,200
Man.

848
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,900
Makes sense.

849
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,300
Right?

850
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:15,800
So if we are going to do the one, you know, if it's a if it's a group

851
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
we handle it and if it's not a group, we don't kind of a thing.

852
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,700
We do the other path.

853
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,000
So yeah.

854
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
So if I want to do that, I'm trying to think about what I would need

855
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,400
to do here.

856
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,300
It looks, I think I can just go ahead and do basically this exact same

857
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,400
path for now.

858
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,300
Just to get us, get into a place where we can do stuff.

859
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,200
So let me

860
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Do that effectively, right?

861
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,400
We don't want to do debug event to text.

862
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,900
In fact, when we do debug text out,

863
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:58,800
it would be nice if debugs text out, let me just see how debug text

864
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,600
that worked.

865
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,900
I'm interested to know it would have been nice if we had made it so

866
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,500
that we could have passed in length, strings, right?

867
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,100
It would have been nice if we could just pass the length of a string

868
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,800
and have that do it because, you know, when it actually outputs text,

869
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,400
there's no reason this couldn't be a, an index Loop here as well,

870
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,000
right?

871
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,000
So, that's a little bit unfortunate to say the least, but that's okay.

872
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,900
I'll get over it.

873
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,400
This can be crappy for now since we're kind of in the middle of other

874
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,700
things, I don't really mind.

875
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:45,600
So I'll just say all right link children named length is less than R.

876
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
I can't text.

877
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,500
Which it's always going to be but just want to make sure that we're

878
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,000
sort of asserting on our crappy code.

879
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,500
And then what I want to do is I want to just kind of copy into that

880
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,300
text buffer.

881
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,600
So I'm just going to I'm going to literally just do this.

882
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,400
Where I take the name length and I copy into that text buffer.

883
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Whatever the name was.

884
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,600
And I should probably say plus one because I need space for the null

885
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,500
Terminator as well.

886
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,600
And that does this whole situation and I don't actually know, I feel

887
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,700
like we had code for doing groups before but I don't really remember

888
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,100
what we ended up doing with it so I'm not sure.

889
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,700
So for the moment, like where's the thing?

890
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,800
I guess.

891
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,400
Like, where's the thing that tracks?

892
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,300
The depth is the depth is here, so I guess that's fine.

893
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,200
I don't know though.

894
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,600
We may have to go remember how this code worked so that we can

895
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,900
actually restore our processing.

896
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,500
Of it.

897
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:04,300
Yeah.

898
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,800
And I guess that at the moment can be can be gone.

899
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,900
So, item color, I don't really know what that was doing before.

900
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,600
So it's an is hot sort of a thing, okay?

901
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,600
So that's all good.

902
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,900
I'm actually do it this way.

903
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,300
I feel like we have this code before but we must have kind of gotten

904
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,500
rid of it at some point.

905
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,800
All right, so actually amusingly that work.

906
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,800
The first time, which this is supposed to be a stream about deep

907
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,600
depression.

908
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:01,600
And so I'm not really sure how to take that other than to be extremely

909
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,000
depressed about the fact that it worked the first time.

910
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,500
But you can kind of see.

911
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,200
Now, we've got our

912
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,100
Our Harkey simulation.

913
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,500
And put simulation over there.

914
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,100
We have ai familiar.

915
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,600
It did two levels.

916
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,200
They're like, just like it should have done render a camera, do the

917
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,800
same thing so, that, that totally self-assembled exactly the way that

918
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,000
we would have wanted it to.

919
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,800
So, that's actually exactly what we wanted.

920
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,400
So, yeah.

921
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,100
Okay, so we now, just want to kind of go in there.

922
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:40,600
Presumably and actually do something where we will allow you to

923
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,300
Expand and collapse in which we already had sore.

924
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:46,200
Just restoring our old code that we had working for that matter,

925
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,400
right?

926
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,700
That's really all we need to do to get that happening.

927
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,400
So I'll go ahead and I'll go ahead and do that.

928
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,000
How much time do we have left?

929
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,600
Let's dream.

930
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,700
Only about 7 minutes but that might be enough time to make that

931
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,200
happen.

932
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,800
We'll see.

933
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,500
Okay.

934
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,300
So yeah again I think that this code could be sand to be cleaned up a

935
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,800
little bit.

936
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,300
That's certainly true but we can do that next week that's all good and

937
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:14,700
let's see here.

938
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:20,400
So what the problem is that we eliminated the place where group

939
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,500
expansion and collapsing is stored.

940
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,400
I believe.

941
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,100
Oh no, we didn't.

942
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,400
We still have it in debug you.

943
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:28,700
That's where that is.

944
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,900
So really all we have to do is reinstate that code where we don't

945
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,400
actually know if we accidentally deleted it all or what happened to

946
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,800
it.

947
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,300
Here we go.

948
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:50,200
So here it's got the expanded stuff happening there so so yeah, we're

949
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,300
pretty close looks like and and here is yeah.

950
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,700
So so I think, I think really all we need to do is this

951
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,800
and say, you know, the iteration,

952
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,300
Is going to be based on The View.

953
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,900
Right, and we will do that.

954
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,500
Push if necessary, write this code is to janky the way that this

955
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,400
iterates over things.

956
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,700
I don't, I don't really like, to be completely honest with you and

957
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,300
yeah, because like it's got link here.

958
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,200
It processes, linked it then, does Interlink equals everything.

959
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:35,900
Yeah.

960
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,600
I don't like the way we wrote this stack thing, I feel like they're

961
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,200
it's too obtuse.

962
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,800
It'd be nice to make this more straightforward and cleaner in a way

963
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,200
that was more legible less likely to be messed up.

964
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,000
But anyway, so we got the expanded always thing or whatever.

965
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,200
This is happening here we now are checking on that.

966
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,600
So what we need to do is just get that view.

967
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:07,300
So we need to do it like this right where we can just say like okay

968
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:13,500
grab the view for this thing and and I think that's all we really

969
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,000
need.

970
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:15,900
Right.

971
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,900
And so, once we know that, we can also create an interaction for it.

972
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:32,200
Which I guess, I'm not sure what default interaction did originally.

973
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:41,600
But what we want to do here is we want to create an interaction that's

974
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,600
going to allow things to expand and collapse, right?

975
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,300
So we just want an interaction for this guy that would do like,

976
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,700
toggle, collapse or whatever.

977
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,900
Do we have one of those?

978
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,300
I feel like we must have because one point it was working debug

979
00:55:59,300 --> 00:55:59,900
interaction.

980
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,600
I just saw the code for it as well.

981
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,600
Knob toggle value drag value to every size select but I just saw there

982
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,600
there just was and expand.

983
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,800
Always right?

984
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,300
I mean it's right there so it was toggle value I guess is what we

985
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,000
called it.

986
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,200
Some kind of generic thing.

987
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,400
Yeah.

988
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,200
yeah, typical

989
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,500
typically generic, you know it's just like the way life wants

990
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:35,000
everything to sort of be slotted into some homogeneous selfless like

991
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,800
sort of being selfless but sort of

992
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,400
It's just the unbearable sameness of it all, you know.

993
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,900
So let's take a look and see what that does here.

994
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,900
Who is calling 0, VAR, link interaction?

995
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,800
This is not actually a this is not actually a viral ink.

996
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,900
It is.

997
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,300
Something else but of course, I don't know if we have an interaction,

998
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,100
that's four groups, we may have to create one, right?

999
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,000
Because of our link interaction,

1000
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,800
Let's see, get event from link.

1001
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,500
And Dubai, right?

1002
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,000
So if it's calling debug variable link, although what it should do is

1003
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,600
just I feel like it should sort of detect that, right?

1004
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,500
Because it can so item interaction event.

1005
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,400
I feel like, yeah.

1006
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,500
I feel like that's not.

1007
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
I feel like it should be able to detect that.

1008
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,300
So let me I want to look and see how that get traction stuff, worked

1009
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,400
in toggle value.

1010
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:54,400
Right?

1011
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,200
So here's toggle value when we create this guy.

1012
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,300
We take a look at what the event is.

1013
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,900
It was an open data block.

1014
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,000
We did this right.

1015
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,300
So that suggests that all these those open data blocks, were going to

1016
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,000
be things that were being cynical after but that's not really what we

1017
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,100
want, right?

1018
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,000
That's not what we want at all.

1019
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,400
We want there to be a way to yeah.

1020
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,400
So, so this is really what we want, we want debug interaction, you

1021
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,800
know, expand or toggle expansion.

1022
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,400
And I don't think we want this at all.

1023
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,500
Right.

1024
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,600
We want that.

1025
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,500
That makes sense.

1026
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,200
I think that's what we want.

1027
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,800
And so since that's the case, it really only needs this sort of a

1028
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,500
thing here.

1029
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,800
So really what we could do instead of our aggression we can just do

1030
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,200
this sort of stuff directly, right?

1031
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,700
We can just call this directly.

1032
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,600
So instead of a violent interaction, it's really just a regular

1033
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,300
interaction.

1034
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,600
Debug ID interaction like so.

1035
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,400
And we've got the the link that's made from the tree there.

1036
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,900
There we go.

1037
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,500
We need to name the sky.

1038
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,300
So that we can have him.

1039
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,100
And then we also need to actually pass that, so, toggle expansion.

1040
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:33,800
So.

1041
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,100
So let's see how that looks.

1042
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,500
Don't know why those are all highlighting.

1043
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,200
But now we're working properly.

1044
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,000
So that's all good.

1045
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:55,400
And so why is the item color item interaction tree link?

1046
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,200
Why are they all?

1047
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,900
Why is that item interaction always considered?

1048
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,500
Hot.

1049
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,500
That's a little bit strange.

1050
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,100
Because this should be specific to the tree link here, right?

1051
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,200
And correct me if I'm wrong.

1052
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,600
But it's a different link every time.

1053
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,300
Where is that guy?

1054
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,500
Debug ID from link.

1055
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,700
Where is debug ID from link?

1056
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,300
I don't actually know.

1057
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,800
divide ID from

1058
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:35,700
think.

1059
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,100
And I think that does mean we're out of time as well.

1060
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:48,200
But I'm going to take a little longer, let's see.

1061
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,000
That looks correct.

1062
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So I'm not sure, I'm not sure why.

1063
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,200
It thinks that we are in why thinks they're all hot there?

1064
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,600
That's, that's a bit.

1065
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,100
It's a bit obtuse to me and I'm not sure why everything else work just

1066
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:08,600
fine.

1067
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,500
So I'd like to know

1068
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,400
What it and in fact you can see we shouldn't we should probably do,

1069
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,400
like, debug i d like this.

1070
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,000
Because this is the same thing.

1071
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,100
Right.

1072
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:39,800
So I don't really know.

1073
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,700
I don't know why that's doing that.

1074
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,400
That is a bit surprising to me.

1075
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,600
And so, all I really know is that, for whatever reason, the

1076
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:52,000
interaction is always coming back as hot and that should be checking,

1077
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:56,900
I would think to see whether or not the hot interaction and our

1078
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,000
interaction of the same.

1079
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,600
And I guess it's checking type.

1080
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
In generic.

1081
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,800
What are the type in generic?

1082
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,800
But it's not actually checking the ID.

1083
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,200
Did we do that on purpose?

1084
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,800
Why does it not check the ID?

1085
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,200
Shouldn't this also say, debug IDs are equal.

1086
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:38,900
That just seems like probably I mean your but IDs are equal.

1087
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,100
I feel like that must have just been an oversight because we've gone

1088
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,800
through so many iterations of the code that we just didn't quite do

1089
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,300
that because that makes no sense, right?

1090
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:54,400
Like the interaction has an ID on it, those IDs have to be equal in

1091
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,700
order for it to be the same interaction so it shouldn't ever be

1092
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,800
considered hot unless that was true, right?

1093
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,100
in other words, this

1094
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,900
this should have to be.

1095
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,300
Like that.

1096
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:09,800
I would assume.

1097
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,400
And big surprise that works.

1098
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,700
All right, so I'm going to go ahead and go to the Q&A because I think

1099
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,600
that's all good.

1100
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,000
Now, I'm pretty happy with where that's at.

1101
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,400
Yeah.

1102
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,900
All right, we're getting pretty close on this debug stuff.

1103
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,100
I'm feeling pretty good about it.

1104
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:38,700
I mean, what I mean, I'm very depressed about it.

1105
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,400
And it's awful and everyone should give up now.

1106
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,100
And with that, I'm going to go to the free stream.

1107
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,100
D7 Samurai was this the depression oriented programming approach?

1108
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,900
I keep hearing about yes, very important.

1109
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,600
You need to read the book depression oriented programming or

1110
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,200
something.

1111
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,600
M1 elu pass string.

1112
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,000
Length together with pointer to string data in several places.

1113
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,400
Do you think it would be better to create a string?

1114
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,900
Struck that holds length and a data point.

1115
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,900
You know, it hasn't really been something that I've felt like we were

1116
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:55,700
that was cumbersome currently so no but I do do that.

1117
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,900
Sometimes it just hasn't gotten to the point where I really thought

1118
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,100
that that was necessary.

1119
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,800
So while I wouldn't say, don't do that.

1120
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:08,500
I also in this case, don't really feel like it's super necessary to do

1121
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,800
that make sense.

1122
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,600
If it's to radiate, you've talked a lot about about layers lately.

1123
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,800
Have you taken a look at Swift?

1124
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,700
At all thoughts, I have not taken up the Swift it all but I thought

1125
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,200
Swift was like an interpreted language or something new, which case I

1126
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,600
doubly don't want anything to do with it.

1127
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,400
Elvin, how do you come up with that literacy stuff?

1128
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,300
That was awesome literacy.

1129
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:43,000
You mean like being able to being able to read

1130
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,200
I'm not sure, I understand what you mean by literacy stuff, but I'm

1131
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,900
happy to tell you how I came up with it.

1132
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,600
If you tell me what that meant

1133
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:57,000
program gamer, I don't get anything.

1134
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,400
Okay.

1135
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,300
Well,

1136
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,300
That is a problem.

1137
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,000
But don't despair.

1138
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,400
You could go back to the beginning of handmade here and start there,

1139
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,200
perhaps.

1140
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,500
Union fan, do you think that the bug in debug interactions are equal,

1141
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,300
would have been caught by compiler generated comparison operator as in

1142
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,400
C++

1143
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:32,000
First of all, I didn't know that C++ generated comparison operators.

1144
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,900
When did they add that?

1145
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,000
Because it didn't used to.

1146
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,800
What, what are you talking about?

1147
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,200
Did they add a feature recently?

1148
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,500
Where you can tell it to automatically generate one?

1149
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:50,100
Or what because it didn't, it did that didn't used to be a feature as

1150
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,700
for whether it was something that would have helped us.

1151
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:01,600
No, because it probably can't generate automatic code for the union,

1152
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
so we probably couldn't have used it.

1153
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,800
It would be too dumb.

1154
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,000
Grug.

1155
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,400
I will handmade Euro to be written in Jay.

1156
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,500
I don't know that.

1157
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,600
I'm going to make a handmade hero too, but

1158
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,000
Elvin.

1159
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,900
I meant literature talks, sorry.

1160
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:22,900
Oh yeah, I don't know.

1161
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,400
That's that's just like

1162
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,900
I am good at making up parody sounding literary phrases so I can kind

1163
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:35,700
of do them while I'm doing something else.

1164
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,800
It's not too bad.

1165
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,600
I mean, they don't, they're not great obviously, but they could be

1166
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:41,300
good enough.

1167
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,000
I feel like part of that's just like, it's just mimic rewrites.

1168
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,700
Like, if you hear enough of those silly, kind of things you can, you

1169
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,600
can generate them.

1170
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,700
it's sort of like doing an impersonation of a celebrity, write your

1171
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,000
impersonating, a philosophy student,

1172
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,900
The geek pirate.

1173
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,500
Who is your favorite figure in the Computing?

1174
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,800
World Dead, or Alive.

1175
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,400
Mine's Claude, Shannon?

1176
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:04,400
It's not a bad one.

1177
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,500
I don't know.

1178
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,300
I Like Cows but he's not really Computing.

1179
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,300
He's more math.

1180
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,000
How about handmade browser and J?

1181
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,300
I, I don't I think if you were going to start with that, you just

1182
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,500
rewrite the web and like the actual like substrate.

1183
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,300
I wouldn't Implement a browser because the prop half, not even half

1184
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,399
90% of the problem.

1185
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:36,700
With the web with web browsers, is not the browser.

1186
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,100
It's the spec.

1187
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,899
Luigi, off-topic.

1188
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:42,800
But how old were you in?

1189
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:43,399
Sort of coding.

1190
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:44,500
I was seven.

1191
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,100
A pulsing Mage, do you think that Intel kidding?

1192
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,300
The process size limit will make video game falter, or will they

1193
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,000
survive?

1194
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,500
I think they'll survive just fine.

1195
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,899
To be honest, I don't.

1196
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,800
In the video game industry is really predicated on on Hardware

1197
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,200
improvements these days.

1198
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,500
I mean, I think that's almost just almost self-evident by the fact

1199
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,100
that like a lot of the biggest franchises aren't even very good look

1200
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,200
like, I mean, if you look at the latest Call of Duty, it doesn't even

1201
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:18,800
look very good.

1202
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,500
Like it actually looks kind of old tech-wise.

1203
01:09:23,899 --> 01:09:25,700
And then nobody seems to care.

1204
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,700
Casey you are as old as me.

1205
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,800
Are you also planning to retire from working as soon as possible?

1206
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:44,200
No, I like working and and in fact II, don't know really what I do

1207
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:44,700
with myself.

1208
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:49,600
If I stop working, what I really want is not stopped working.

1209
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,100
What I want is to have a better environment in which to work.

1210
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,300
I want to have like a

1211
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,400
an environment where the rest of the people who work on Computing,

1212
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:06,100
actually care about it being good and saying,

1213
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,300
Like I want to live in a world where nobody would ever say something.

1214
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:22,400
Like I think the answer to this problem is to take a high-level

1215
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,800
language and compile it to a lower level language and then compile

1216
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,900
that to JavaScript which we've set up as a template in a specific way

1217
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,500
so that the browser can read it and know that it was generated by that

1218
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:38,100
process and then compile that into native code and then run it.

1219
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,700
I want to live in a world where that's just obviously,

1220
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,800
You know, that you need to just stop erase everything on, everyone's

1221
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,400
hard drive at your company and start over instead of going.

1222
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,800
Like, I think that's a good idea.

1223
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,600
Let's go, let's go forward.

1224
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,200
What do you think about test-driven Development?

1225
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,200
I've answered that question.

1226
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,100
So many times, I'm going to have to skip it, sorry.

1227
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,900
But we've answered that like many many, many times.

1228
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,300
Actually play games yourself.

1229
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,100
If so what?

1230
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,900
Yes, I haven't had much time to lately but you can actually watch

1231
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,400
effect.

1232
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,900
If you go to my twitch chat, my personal twist Channel, senior ettore,

1233
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,100
you can even see like old recordings, I think on there there's of me

1234
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,400
like playing some games and stuff.

1235
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,900
Why should I keep on going in this harsh?

1236
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,600
Cold reality when I get lost on episode 005 of ham in here.

1237
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Oh why why indeed, right?

1238
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:54,300
And you know, the because existence is meaningless and we are separate

1239
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,700
points in a void that can never feel any connection, you know.

1240
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:10,300
Ever sort of, like transcend, our human limits of sort of our Earthly

1241
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,000
trappings.

1242
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,100
Why indeed, why?

1243
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:16,400
Why even watch handmade here at all?

1244
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,500
And the answer I think is that we just have to have faith.

1245
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:30,800
That the variable is watching down is looking down on us from the

1246
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:31,600
great memory.

1247
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:38,100
And that if we all just like work hard and try to be good, people that

1248
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,800
eventually the variable will let us into the great memory and we will

1249
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,300
live in peace and happiness with all of our other.

1250
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,400
Are discretize values.

1251
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,200
Active binary, would you prefer to you, I and C code or use something

1252
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,400
like HTML or something else?

1253
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,600
I always prefer C code or rather more specifically meta program C code

1254
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,400
but definitely not HTML.

1255
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,300
Engineer.

1256
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,400
Oh if you could be given complete control over Microsoft or apple,

1257
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,300
which one would you choose and what would be your number one priority?

1258
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,100
If I was given complete control over either of them, I wouldn't care

1259
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:26,800
which one you gave me and my first priority would be restoring.

1260
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,100
The, the old concept that an operating system, is an open platform for

1261
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:36,600
running code and its primary goal, is to make a stable environment for

1262
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,100
people to run programs on.

1263
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,100
That's what I would do.

1264
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,300
Which by the way, neither of those companies ever does or cares about

1265
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:44,800
in any way.

1266
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:45,700
As far as I can tell.

1267
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,200
Brett Hudson mind giving a shout-out about your appearance on the

1268
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,000
Indie Radio podcast tomorrow.

1269
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,400
Sure,

1270
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,800
you know what, I'll be honest with you.

1271
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:03,300
I don't really know much about the Indie Radio podcast.

1272
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:11,000
They asked me if I wanted to be on the show and I said yes because I

1273
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,800
like both the concept of podcasts and the concept of Indie Miss.

1274
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:21,200
I went and listened to the podcast as well and it seemed like a cool

1275
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:27,100
podcast but I know nothing other than the fact that I will be on it

1276
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,300
and it was like, I don't know how you search for it, but

1277
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,600
It was like, it kind of looked like that, like you have parentheses

1278
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,300
around it.

1279
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,400
So, yes, I know nothing about it.

1280
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:40,800
I know.

1281
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,700
Absolutely nothing.

1282
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:45,700
I do not know who bread Hudson is, for example, I am like the most

1283
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:51,600
ignorant person about any of this but you can go to this site in

1284
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,800
d,function.com and find out more about it.

1285
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,300
That's how I found out more about it.

1286
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:57,400
It's also very pretty like it's a nice.

1287
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,900
We design site, but this radio button,

1288
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,800
Here, I know this is where I went, that's all I know.

1289
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,500
So I listened to some of the back of the I don't know how you listen

1290
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,300
to it live.

1291
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,100
It looks like there's just some kind of flash thing here.

1292
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,600
Maybe.

1293
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,900
So tomorrow you could come here.

1294
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,000
I believe it's at 12 p.m.

1295
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,700
if I'm not.

1296
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,800
It's at noon, I think.

1297
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,700
But I don't know when the live when happens.

1298
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,500
I assume it happens.

1299
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,700
Then I like I said a little I literally nothing about it.

1300
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:27,500
Other than I said, I'd love to be on the show and I will be on the

1301
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:27,800
show.

1302
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:28,500
That is all.

1303
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,800
I know I am.

1304
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,600
I'm as in the dark as anyone else.

1305
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,500
So, so maybe Brett Hudson.

1306
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,400
I can tell you more about it.

1307
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,200
But I'll be posting a link on my Twitter to it after it's done anyway

1308
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,500
so you can listen to it after the fact.

1309
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,500
So does that I will know for sure.

1310
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,700
Mitch 77 xkc.

1311
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:02,300
The question was not entirely meant to be funny.

1312
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,600
Can you imagine to still code games and stuff when you were like 60?

1313
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:12,700
Yeah, I mean, I would like to continue working on technology projects

1314
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:14,600
when until I'm 60.

1315
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:15,700
The question will not be.

1316
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,600
Whether I want to the question will be whether or not I'm good enough

1317
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,100
to because at some point, your brain is just too old to do anything

1318
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,600
useful.

1319
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:28,200
But you know, maybe if I do enough good stuff while I'm still capable

1320
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:28,700
of it.

1321
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:33,400
You know, someone will let me be sort of like, just a random, you

1322
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:39,300
know, old sort of good luck charm at their game company or something.

1323
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,800
And that would be fine with me too.

1324
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,200
Like they wouldn't even have to pay me, right?

1325
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,700
Because hopefully, I'm retired.

1326
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,800
I have enough money by then to like live or whatever.

1327
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,700
I'd be happy to just kind of like go in and like participate a little

1328
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,500
bit or whatever, you know.

1329
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:55,700
K.

1330
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,300
Sometimes I compare myself with other repairs, get depressed because

1331
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,900
I'm far away from their level.

1332
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,400
I know I shouldn't be comparing because they grew up in different

1333
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,600
environments and I know for sure I can reach their level if I apply

1334
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,500
myself and learn quick.

1335
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,100
But sometimes it just gets to me and I feel bad about it.

1336
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,400
Have you ever felt that way?

1337
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,200
Any tips on how to overcome it?

1338
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,000
um,

1339
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,200
I guess I don't know if I've ever felt that way.

1340
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,300
I don't think so, I don't think I've ever felt that way.

1341
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,100
I guess what I would say is,

1342
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,200
There's obviously any particular thing.

1343
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,900
Some of it is nature and some of its nurture, right?

1344
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,500
And

1345
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,100
You got whatever genetics you got in terms of your ability to

1346
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,200
understand code and to be a good coder and whatever.

1347
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Like, it's whatever was up.

1348
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,400
There is up there, right?

1349
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,800
And so that part is fixed and you can't change.

1350
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,900
So the part that you can effect is how hard you work at it, right?

1351
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,500
And so I would say that the majority of the you know, of the

1352
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,200
Of what you want to do, is just make sure that you program a lot

1353
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,800
everyday and if you do that, you know, that you will at least reach

1354
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,300
your own potential, right?

1355
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,500
And I don't really know what to say about it.

1356
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,200
Other than that, there's no sense in getting depressed about it either

1357
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:29,500
way.

1358
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,500
I know we this was The Depression stream so I should be saying

1359
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,300
something like in character and depressing, but in actuality I don't

1360
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,100
want to say anything depressing about that because I feel like really

1361
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
what you want to do is approach it in that way.

1362
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,100
You want to basically go like look I got whatever I got in terms of

1363
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,600
natural talent for this and the rest of what determines how much

1364
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,700
interesting stuff I'll do in my program, career is just how hard I

1365
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,000
worked at it because

1366
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Yourself on an absolute scale.

1367
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,300
Someone else like someone else may have been born with a better

1368
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,400
programming brain than you.

1369
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:58,900
Right?

1370
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,100
That's just the truth.

1371
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,500
It could be possible, Right?

1372
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,400
But who cares?

1373
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:06,800
It doesn't matter.

1374
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,000
There's there's not some ranking of programmers.

1375
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,900
That's like your tits.

1376
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,500
There's no Olympics for programming.

1377
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,600
And even if there were is, it wouldn't matter, right?

1378
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Your ranking.

1379
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,200
Among where you are in programming is, is not really relevant what

1380
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,900
you're able to accomplish in your career, is what's relevant and, and

1381
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,600
on a more personal level whether you enjoy, it is what's relevant,

1382
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,100
right?

1383
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,600
Those are the two things, you know, whether whether you get

1384
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,100
satisfaction,

1385
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,400
And whether or not you accomplished something interesting, that's

1386
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:39,800
what's actually matters and the chances that you're not smart enough

1387
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,800
to do programming.

1388
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,600
That matters is pretty low.

1389
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,100
I think, you know if you're able to follow anything on handmade here

1390
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,700
are you're probably at a point, you know?

1391
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:53,900
And I seen you ask a lot of questions you're obviously thinking about

1392
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:54,500
this stuff a lot.

1393
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,000
So

1394
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,500
I feel like the chances that you don't have enough gray matter in

1395
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,300
there to make it work is low.

1396
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,700
And so what's much more likely is not working hard enough at it?

1397
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,700
And not doing enough to try and, you know, not not writing enough code

1398
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:14,200
and so then you never actually, you know, do much.

1399
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,700
And it's worth noting that most programmers will never really do

1400
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:19,700
anything particularly interesting, right?

1401
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,000
Because they just don't work that hard to let go in and like read

1402
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,800
Facebook all day and their or they're like, you know, I

1403
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:31,500
You know, twiddled some PHP code and imported some Library so that

1404
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,300
like Facebook's like GIF resizer could resize.

1405
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,700
Like, you know, an animated cat or something, right?

1406
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:41,300
Like, you know, a lot of people just aren't picking interesting

1407
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:41,900
projects.

1408
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,600
They're not dedicating themselves to them.

1409
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,100
They're spending a lot of time in the, at the ping-pong table, or

1410
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,500
whatever else, right?

1411
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:52,300
And so, just being diligent and picking interesting projects to try.

1412
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,700
And actually, you know, up,

1413
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,500
applying yourself to try and solve an interesting problem is already

1414
01:20:59,500 --> 01:20:59,800
putting

1415
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,900
Of ahead of, like, most of the people who call themselves programmers,

1416
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,500
most of people who call themselves programmers, are just trying to

1417
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,200
figure out how to get like a high-paying web job or something, you

1418
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,900
know, like, they just want to, like, do that.

1419
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,800
And so, you know, you don't have to be.

1420
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:20,200
Even the world's smartest programmer in the world, you just have to

1421
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,400
apply yourself and I think you're in good shape there.

1422
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,100
That's what I think, anyway, but I don't know.

1423
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,900
I mean, I have no idea.

1424
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,800
I can't tell you that it took me a long time to be a good.

1425
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,400
Programmer, for whatever that means, like, for me to consider myself a

1426
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,200
good programmer.

1427
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,800
You know, when I started programming, when I was seven, you know,

1428
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,800
those, I know what was going on and like, I had to call my dad in when

1429
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:49,100
I had bugs because I know, like, how to fix them and, you know, it

1430
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,000
takes a long time.

1431
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,700
So, the other thing I guess I would say is, don't be discouraged if

1432
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,900
you've only been programming for a few years and you're not great at

1433
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:58,300
it yet.

1434
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,800
Well, neither was anybody else?

1435
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:05,200
you know, I don't know anybody who like just sat down and like, you

1436
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,200
know, six months in was a great programmer, I don't

1437
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,500
I don't think that's possible.

1438
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,500
I think programming is very much a linguistic kind of endeavor and

1439
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:15,800
much.

1440
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,100
Like there's nobody who picked up and speaks fluent Japanese, within

1441
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:20,800
six months.

1442
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,300
You don't speak fluency in six months.

1443
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,700
It's a long process.

1444
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,700
And it, and when you're talking about getting to the level of fluency

1445
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,400
to create something you're talking about, like, you're talking about

1446
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,700
learning a language, and then writing a novel, right?

1447
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,600
And if you were to think about how long it would take you to, like,

1448
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,900
pick up a language, you don't know.

1449
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,400
And then write a great book in that language.

1450
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,700
It's a fantastic number of years, right?

1451
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:49,700
I mean that's just a long time and so I think you shouldn't also you

1452
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,100
should.

1453
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,500
You should make sure you don't have unrealistic expectations about

1454
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,600
your ability to program.

1455
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,400
And for how long you've spent on it and so on.

1456
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:02,900
So,

1457
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:11,400
Cast 05.

1458
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,300
Do you think Japanese?

1459
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:12,900
Not adopting?

1460
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,900
The oop Paradigm is because they are smarter or simply because of not

1461
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,500
being interested.

1462
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,700
In changing to new languages.

1463
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,900
I don't, I'm sorry.

1464
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:27,200
I was unaware that the Japanese didn't adopt loop, I have no idea.

1465
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,100
I literally have no idea about that.

1466
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:36,600
I both have never heard of it and don't know that I could say anything

1467
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:36,900
about it.

1468
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:37,800
Even if I had

1469
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,800
JP to pseudocode or question.

1470
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,100
How would one go about learning Assembly Language and are compilers

1471
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,200
linkers written in that?

1472
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,800
So pretty much Assembly Language is not really

1473
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,900
I think that a lot of people programming anymore these days in terms

1474
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:10,100
of the whole code, you know, in the old days when I was a kid,

1475
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:15,000
Certainly like if we talk about the Commodore 64, let's say or the

1476
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,100
Apple to it was very common for someone to write like a whole thing in

1477
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:18,900
Assembly Language.

1478
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,300
That was that was not.

1479
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,700
That would have been a shock.

1480
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,100
If you were like I wrote this commercials before a game in Assembly

1481
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,900
Language, no one would be like, oh my God, what that's weird.

1482
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,800
Nowadays, if you said I wrote this whole game in Assembly Language,

1483
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,700
people be like what are you talking about?

1484
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,700
Nobody does that.

1485
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,800
So you know, Assembly Language.

1486
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:40,800
Nowadays is more something that's that's done.

1487
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,600
In small chunks for only the most important part of your code.

1488
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And so yeah, compilers linkers know.

1489
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
There are almost never written in assembly language.

1490
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:56,500
Typically, what happens is you take an existing compiler, an existing

1491
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:00,200
operating system, in existing compiler, you write the new operating

1492
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,600
system, new compiler, whatever it is on that system and you like crush

1493
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,400
your like cross-compiling, right?

1494
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,700
Or building a compiler with another compiler, until it gets to the

1495
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:09,000
point.

1496
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,100
Where can self host,

1497
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,000
So, you know, if you're interested in learning Assembly Language, I've

1498
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,600
said this before.

1499
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,600
Use the debugger.

1500
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,200
The best way to learn Assembly Language, is to look at what the

1501
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,000
debugger generates.

1502
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,600
Because then you can just say, okay, I put some code in here, go to

1503
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,900
disassembly and now you can see what what it did, right?

1504
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,100
So that's the easiest way to learn it.

1505
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:32,100
I think in addition to obviously like reading people's tutorials

1506
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,600
online, which will be, you know, a way to get you started but to just

1507
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,500
see what happens, you know, anything that you could write in C, you

1508
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,400
can immediately

1509
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,600
The in the debugger, what it generated for assembly.

1510
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,300
So, it's pretty easy for you to go.

1511
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,500
I don't know how I would Implement X.

1512
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,300
Well, just look at how the second power, does it?

1513
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,300
That's a way to kind of learn pretty quickly?

1514
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,300
Something you don't know.

1515
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:11,300
Let me see.

1516
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,900
Would you ever think about using C sharp or python?

1517
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,400
No, I don't like interpreted languages.

1518
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,200
Also, garbage collection is totally unacceptable for me, I hate

1519
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,300
garbage collection as well.

1520
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,600
Yuan fan.

1521
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,000
How do you approach getting an overview of a large code base?

1522
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,400
Like, clang of the Linux kernel.

1523
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,200
I'm the wrong one to ask.

1524
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,500
I'm the wrong one.

1525
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,600
Ask I am not good at that, kind of code.

1526
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,700
That's like a mic.

1527
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:38,600
Certain question.

1528
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,300
You got it yet.

1529
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,000
Ask Mike certain.

1530
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,700
He's the he's the one that does that stuff.

1531
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,100
I, you know, if someone told me you got to fix a bug in clang or

1532
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:53,400
something, I'd be like, I forget it.

1533
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,600
Like I don't even want to know, don't want to know.

1534
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,900
Don't want to look at it.

1535
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:11,400
All right, are we done in Garland abloom?

1536
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
It's not a long stream.

1537
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,800
It's a normal time, right?

1538
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,600
Because we started a half-hour late.

1539
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,800
So that's just go until seven.

1540
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,900
All right, folks, that's about it.

1541
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,100
That's about it.

1542
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,200
My friends.

1543
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,400
I'm going to wind it down, thanks everyone for joining me for another

1544
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:39,400
episode of handmade hero.

1545
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,700
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1546
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:46,900
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

1547
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,900
pre-order the game here on handmade here at dot org and it comes with

1548
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,400
a source code.

1549
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,100
So if you want to follow along at home, it's an easy way to do it and

1550
01:27:55,100 --> 01:28:00,300
it's for your fun and enjoyment, your maximum fun and enjoyment.

1551
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,300
We also have Forum site which you can go to if you want to ask

1552
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,300
questions about series.

1553
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:09,100
Or you can also take a look at our anted episode guide which is done

1554
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,300
by some of the people who are on the chat.

1555
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,700
If you're on their mid blow for example is like the point man.

1556
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:18,600
These days for it even has a patreon page which I think I finally got

1557
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,600
them to link to I say in forever and you got to put the patreon page

1558
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,100
on the episode guide but it wasn't there.

1559
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:23,800
Yeah.

1560
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,300
Now it's there needs to be bigger.

1561
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:32,700
God you guys got to make you spend all the time on the episode guide

1562
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,000
and the what the place where people can pay you for it.

1563
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,800
It's this little tiny never going to see that.

1564
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:43,800
You put it over here or right here or something patreons, contribute

1565
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,400
to the contribute, you know, help make episode guide possible button.

1566
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,100
Right.

1567
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,900
But anyway, point being

1568
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,600
There's a patreon page for me, blow where he actually accepts

1569
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,700
donations for all the work.

1570
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:05,600
He does on the handmade hero annotations which he does a lot of work.

1571
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,000
Like if you look on here you can see like all this stuff.

1572
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,100
Like for example, here is yesterday's, you can see that he puts in all

1573
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,800
these time markers and stuff so you can just jump directly to things.

1574
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,700
You can say like oh okay you know I want to know exactly where you

1575
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:24,000
know this quote was or here's where we did this particular thing.

1576
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:28,000
Or here's where we did this, you know, here's where push sides with

1577
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,100
dealkylation, got removed or whatever, so, it's pretty great.

1578
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,300
When you're trying to learn from a series, you can jump around and

1579
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,000
it's just, it's just a way better than using the royal YouTube.

1580
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:38,900
Anyway, so that's about it.

1581
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,900
If you want to follow the series, obviously you need to know when it's

1582
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,100
on.

1583
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,300
So we also have a tweetbot.

1584
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,900
You can go that button right there, it tweets.

1585
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,300
When the series is live, which will be next week.

1586
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,300
Probably won't have one Friday of next week's.

1587
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,000
I'm guessing because

1588
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,000
Was, is that oh wait, no, no.

1589
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,100
It'll be a full week next week.

1590
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:59,800
So I think next week is Thanksgiving, but I probably will.

1591
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,100
To a stream on Thanksgiving.

1592
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,800
So I think next week I'll be a full week after week after.

1593
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,100
That's right before handmade cons, we might miss a day somewhere

1594
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,900
there, but otherwise should be 5 p.m.

1595
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:11,800
Pacific Standard Time straight through next week.

1596
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,300
But if you're unsure about it, check out the tweetbot.

1597
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,000
It will tell you.

1598
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,700
That's about it for now.

1599
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:20,200
Please enjoy your weekend, have some good coding.

1600
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,800
Despite the fact this was intentionally, our depression stream.

1601
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:28,900
I think, you know, now, the depression streams over you should at

1602
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,400
least be able to enjoy your weekend.

1603
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,400
That's something.

1604
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:34,900
I will try to enjoy mine as well.

1605
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,100
Until Monday.

1606
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,900
Take it easy everyone and I'll see you on the internet.
