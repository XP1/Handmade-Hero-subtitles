1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Time start recording.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,200
There we go.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,400
Okay.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,000
The show.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,100
We could a complete game live on stream.

7
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,300
We are in the process now of working out how we're going to do sort of

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,800
our final entity world-building kind of stuff.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,700
And yesterday, we ended with, I guess, what we did is we sort of ended

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,700
with the concept of the hero, be able to stand on something and that

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,900
something could move, right?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:33,500
And

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,100
What we want to do now is sort of start finishing up that process

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
because I had talked about how I wanted the game to always have the

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,400
understanding that a, any individual entity is who is supposed to be

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,500
walking or moving or hopping on the ground has to occupy points on the

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,600
ground very specifically.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,200
So it's, you know, it's it's an action game and you move the head of

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,100
the character around fairly freely, but where the character standing

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,300
and where everyone else is standing.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,900
It's almost like chess in a way where you are occupying, a particular

22
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,300
square.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
And only one thing can occupy that square.

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,800
And so, what has to happen is?

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,100
We have to have a solid understanding of where every entity is in

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,300
terms of what Square they're on.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,700
And so we sort of did the first part about that yesterday but we

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
haven't done the second part.

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,000
And so that's what I'm going to look at.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
If I can stop my yogurt from falling over.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,400
All right, so let me just show you what that is.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Also I guess I should always remind you.

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,000
Today, stay 284.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,700
So if you want to follow along at home, day 283 is the source code.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,200
So, here we go.

36
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah.

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,700
So here is where we left off.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,100
And as you can see, we still kind of have, you know, our basic hopping

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,100
is still working exactly the way that it used to and with the

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,000
exception of our rendering, that's all kind of, okay, so far.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
But what we did yesterday, is we just wanted to prove, okay, I can

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,900
kind of go down and and ride this thing.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,600
Unfortunately, we have this problem and this was the thing that I was

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,000
talking about, we need to finish up.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,300
Is that currently, we still don't really in our entity code process.

46
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
The concept that the hero is

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,600
On a particular thing, we always use the point that is closest to his

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,200
head.

49
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
The entity is head as the thing we should jump to.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,100
And so as you might expect what ends up happening as as the hero gets

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,400
into a situation where their head is between two points, it can sort

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,000
of wig out.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The body will keep jumping between two different things, right?

54
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,300
And so we want to obviously we don't ever want that to happen and now

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,200
that we have this more sort of specific concept of where the hero

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
actually is

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,600
Way.

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
And the concept of this traversable is and all that sort of stuff, I

59
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,300
want to basically fix all of that.

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
How is that even possible?

61
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
That looks like a bug.

62
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,900
A pretty good bug though.

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
You see that?

64
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,100
I like that.

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
That's probably a bug in our packing but I want it to happen again.

66
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,200
How do I make it happen again?

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,900
You can see that it kind of wigs out there, it jumps, right.

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,400
And I feel like there's a bug in the in the packing of that guy or

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
something like that, that we should look at but that's I guess a

70
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,200
separate issue.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,100
But anyway, so first things first.

72
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Let's actually go in and finish the code that we were working on

73
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,900
before.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,100
And then we can look in at the sort of the way that these things are

75
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,500
packed and make sure we don't have any bugs there.

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,000
We can put in some assertions for packing where we can pack and unpack

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,500
something and make sure that it's not messed up, right?

78
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,800
Anyway, so how do we do that?

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,200
How do we get out of that?

80
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,600
Sort of hacky place of not really having the person understand where

81
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,000
the standing?

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Well, we already named this thing standing on.

83
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,000
And so really, all we need to do, is start to take our entity

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,200
controlling code more seriously, and actually treat it as such, right?

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
So, the standing on

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,100
Where are you?

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,600
There we go.

88
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,900
So the standing on when we come through here, you can kind of see that

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,000
it's super janky in that what ends up happening is the only thing that

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,899
we use to determine whether or not we're going to hop.

91
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:26,600
Is the distance that the body is from the head that's it and so we

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
don't really wait.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Is that actually true?

94
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
That's like not even with that thing means actually the body Delta is

95
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
the closest unit.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,900
So it's not even that, that's not what that means.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,600
It's the distance to that point to whatever the point is, what we want

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,100
to go to.

99
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,500
So we need to this needs to not be what's happening anymore, right?

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,200
But we need to not make this be the code.

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,500
So let's think through

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,900
A little bit more how we want this to happen, right?

103
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,800
And if we go ahead you know I can I can sort of show you as well.

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,600
What happens if I was just to sort of if their this out, right?

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,200
If I was to say, this is not a thing and instead all I'm going to do

106
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,300
is just do found.

107
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,600
Well, in fact, you know what I can do, the easiest way to do it is

108
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
just to say, found equals false, so assume that it never finds a new

109
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
point to stand on, right?

110
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,000
So essentially what happens is, if I never textures if I never do

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,600
anything else, right, you can see what happens here.

112
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,500
And basically we just stretch out the hero infinitely far, and the

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,900
heroes head will come to rest above whatever point there, you know,

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,500
most closely aligned with right.

115
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,700
And that's not like I said not particularly useful for us and it's not

116
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,000
what we actually want.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
So the first thing we should probably do.

118
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,600
Is make the head be a little bit more specific in how it operates,

119
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,400
right?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,900
And there's two things that I want to do.

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,800
Here one is that I'd like

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Keep the Z height of the head strictly controlled, so that if it's on

123
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,200
the body, it's always in a very specific Place, write it.

124
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,000
In other words, it doesn't float all around in some kind of random

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,900
way, right?

126
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,600
So there's that.

127
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,900
And then the other thing that I want to do is if you can't jump.

128
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,700
So let's say that.

129
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
This was actually the correct thing that should happen.

130
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,600
The heroes body is meant to stay on that square and like maybe there's

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,000
something.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Thing in the way here or, you know, there's something occupying the

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,300
square, so it couldn't go there.

134
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,600
If there's something in the way, then what I want to have happen, is

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
when the heroes head hits the halfway point, I don't want it to go any

136
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
further, right?

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,600
So I basically want the heroes had to stop like right there and and

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,200
not be able to go.

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,800
So even if I'm holding down that button instead of it just continuing

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
on like this and to Ridiculousness, I don't ever want to allow that

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
situation to occur if that makes sense.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,100
So I want to stop

143
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,100
So that's the stuff that we need to work on for the head and then what

144
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,900
we need to work on is when the head does get to that halfway point, we

145
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,800
want to trigger the hopping event so we can say okay if we can get

146
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,400
access to that point then allow the Hop to occur and the head can

147
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,900
continue going right.

148
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,800
So that's what we want again.

149
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,500
It's pretty tricky, control scheme.

150
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
It's, you know, a lot of times is way simpler.

151
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,500
The way a player controller Works where you just kind of move it in

152
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,800
whatever Direction the person pushes and you're done with it.

153
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,800
In this case, we have a much more complicated scenario.

154
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,300
So this code is going to be a lot more complicated again.

155
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,600
That's just par for the course.

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Not a problem.

157
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,100
You just gotta, you know, got to be willing to write the hard code

158
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
when the hard code comes up.

159
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,000
So let's start by thinking about how we're doing this.

160
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
First of all, what we might want to do is just have the body, maybe be

161
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,000
something, where it's hopping, is a little more predictable, so maybe

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,200
we'll do something like say, okay, let's let's pretend we're not going

163
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,400
to do any of this stuff.

164
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,600
Right, and let's I don't know what's going on with facing Direction

165
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:09,800
here.

166
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,900
We just copy that in.

167
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and pull that out here as well.

168
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,900
Okay, so I've got the facing Direction and I've got the DP here

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,500
initialized.

170
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
I've got the entity, pset2, wherever whatever.

171
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,100
The thing is that, we were standing on when we're in the planted mode,

172
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,700
so that's fine.

173
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
And then we've kind of got our other stuff here.

174
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,100
The dtdt Bob, we always I guess.

175
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,500
During this Loop.

176
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,600
So I'm going to put that a little closer to here.

177
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,299
There we go.

178
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,500
And the floor displace is always set based on the head Delta, which is

179
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,400
also fine.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
So I'm going to recompile this here.

181
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,700
So really what I want to do now is just kind of replace this logic

182
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,500
that we were using, which is about what we're supposed to do, right?

183
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,800
Whether we're supposed to do,

184
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,100
The Hop or not and what's supposed to happen, right?

185
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,600
So what I want to do there is I'd like to do something where we sort

186
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
of say, okay?

187
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:16,800
If we're planted I don't want to start hopping unless somebody has

188
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
told us to start hopping right?

189
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,000
And maybe that hopping is some kind of, I don't know, it's some kind

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
of a request.

191
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,700
Maybe that hopping is actually triggered by the head for example.

192
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,900
So maybe this in and of itself.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Elf is actually going to be moved out, right?

194
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,400
Let's say we do something like this.

195
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,500
So we come up here to the head and we say that this is going to be

196
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,800
something that happens on the head side of things, right?

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,800
And I don't know exactly what will happen with it yet but we're going

198
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,000
to put it out there and similarly, I guess we could also copy all this

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
code in as well.

200
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
I don't know that we're going to use it.

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,100
But we could try.

202
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,900
So now, here we go with the

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,400
With the code that we have before.

204
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,700
And if you look, it's really just the floor displace.

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,300
I think that uses the head anymore.

206
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,300
Nothing else uses the head really.

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,400
So it's so I think what we could do is also move this head stuff.

208
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Move that down.

209
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,700
Because now, all of these things.

210
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,300
The rest of the how the body Hops and stuff, all of that stuff, is now

211
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,500
something that we could allow to have happened separately, right?

212
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,300
Meaning, the hopping is sort of isolated from whether there was a head

213
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,600
that was gone controlling it.

214
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
And the reason that I care about this is that we're eventually going

215
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,900
to want hopping creatures, potentially, and we would want to reuse

216
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
this code, right?

217
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,700
Because there's no reason why we would have to change the code in that

218
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,200
case.

219
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,300
all right, so

220
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,000
in movement mode planted.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So again, this can come down here and this can be something that just

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,500
says, hey,

223
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Is all of this code Duty, Bob.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,900
So, all of this code is not based on the head either.

225
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,600
And this is just if we're in the planted mode.

226
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,900
So, there we go.

227
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,400
so now we've sort of taken the head out of that, and

228
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,800
I guess.

229
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,300
Also you know since the head distance is probably something will be

230
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,800
Computing more elsewhere.

231
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,500
I guess we could also move even this part we could move this up to the

232
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,200
head controller so that we never I get you right.

233
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,500
I mean because I guess there's really no reason not to do that as

234
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:17,800
well.

235
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,800
So the head controller can trivially just reach in there and do that,

236
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,200
right?

237
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,500
Okay, so now what should happen in theory is no matter what I do at

238
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:31,800
the head.

239
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,700
The body should just stay there and not do anything, right?

240
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
And that is exactly what happens.

241
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,700
Okay, so now let's go ahead and expand up this code and start to work

242
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
on the head controller.

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,900
So on the head controller,

244
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,400
empty space there.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,400
Hmm.

246
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Are we going to get new indentation stuff anytime soon?

247
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,800
Allen is indentation on the menu.

248
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
I don't really know what's going on with for coder at the moment.

249
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,200
Maybe that's not current thing.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I thought I saw Alan.

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm here earlier, let's see.

252
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,800
So in through this code, what we want to do here is say, alright,

253
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,600
let's re-enable the parts that are have nothing to do with the

254
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
movement first, because those are the ones that we already know, we

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
kind of want, right?

256
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,800
So what we actually want to do through here is rather than talking

257
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,400
about head and entity and that source of I think what I'd rather do is

258
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,000
have head and body be specific, even and rather that way when we move

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,400
code between the two, it won't change.

260
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,200
Right?

261
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,500
So I don't know if we ever look at the body in here.

262
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,300
I thought we did, but I'm not sure.

263
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,300
It looks like we actually don't, I thought we did, but maybe we don't

264
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,000
anymore, I don't know.

265
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,400
But either way, when we come in here to do the controlling for the

266
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,700
hero head, what I want to do is I want to go ahead and make it so that

267
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
we track The Head and the body.

268
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,300
Like so,

269
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,400
Right.

270
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,500
And then we can just say well if there's a body will do body things.

271
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
If there isn't, there isn't right?

272
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,600
And so this code was not using the body before this code is using the

273
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,200
body before.

274
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,700
So now, I'll just go ahead and say if the body exists, then through

275
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,300
here.

276
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,500
What I actually want to do is replace the word entity everywhere with

277
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,500
the word body.

278
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:44,900
Oops.

279
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,200
because that's what was previously, The Entity that was being talked

280
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,100
about their but now isn't and so what we can do here is say, well,

281
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,800
alright, all of this stuff that was previously before

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
Requiring the body.

283
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,900
Now, existence here, and again, anywhere that it was talking about

284
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,400
entity.

285
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,400
I will just go ahead and force it to talk about the oops.

286
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,800
I don't know why.

287
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,200
I can't spell entity for some reason.

288
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,900
So, there we go.

289
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,600
Body is not am a member of entity.

290
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,500
Wait, what?

291
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,500
It's not.

292
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,500
Is it head?

293
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,100
What is it?

294
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,500
That is never mind and so yeah.

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So the only thing that we have left that is now something that's a bit

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,500
of a little bit.

297
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,000
Tricky is the bounciness.

298
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,400
When we're in the movement mode planted, we were trying to make our

299
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,100
bounciness be proportional for to how far away the head was right.

300
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,900
And so I don't know to what degree to what degree we want to split the

301
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,500
code between these two, right?

302
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,200
But you see I'm kind of figure out like exactly how much should live

303
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,100
in one and versus how much should live in the other and a lot of that

304
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,400
has to do with how they would separate out to whether or not.

305
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,300
You're both operating separately versus operating together.

306
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,600
And the question here is just that well, this is really something that

307
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,300
DDT Bob, seems like it should be kind of something that's more related

308
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,600
to the body, but

309
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,700
I guess it really only requires T head distance and T had distance was

310
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,300
not a particularly complicated thing to compute, right?

311
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,400
It's just the difference between these two.

312
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,800
It's just this value here and so I think we could probably safely have

313
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
left it down below.

314
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,900
So maybe we will.

315
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,300
Oops.

316
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,800
Because if I look at this, it's only head Delta that gets used

317
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,300
separately.

318
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,300
So what I could do is say, all right here is, you know, the

319
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,300
hero body stuff in here.

320
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
We could just say

321
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,800
oops.

322
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
That we want to set the DDT Bob.

323
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
If there is a head

324
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,599
Then compute the head Delta.

325
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,500
Right now in here we want to keep the same naming scheme so I think I

326
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,200
want to get like I said I want to go with something like this where no

327
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
matter which controller I mean I can always talk about the head in the

328
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
body and just say, if I have a head, if I have a body whatever.

329
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,900
So I'm just going to go ahead and reverse what's happening here like

330
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,300
so

331
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to go ahead and run.

332
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:43,800
All right.

333
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,400
So now, we can see essentially, What's Happening Here is we're just

334
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,900
getting that sort of stretching out action is happening, but we

335
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,000
haven't reenable the rest of the code, right?

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,700
So let's go ahead and go back in and try to make that happen.

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,100
Yeah, so let's see how this stuff works.

338
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,600
When we have a body were trying to find the closest reversible.

339
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,300
We're seeing if we found it if we were, we would switch the mode.

340
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,100
Oh, so interestingly enough that should have started.

341
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,800
We should have been able to initiate a hop, but it didn't initiate a

342
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,400
hop.

343
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,900
So I think that I messed something up because we owe I see what it is.

344
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,800
There we go.

345
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Still not, right.

346
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,900
Not correct.

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
So, let's see what we've got here.

348
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,300
This is just sitting DDT Bob, which is when there's the head, it

349
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,200
wanted to do that sort of head distance Bob down, so that's fine.

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,500
And with hopping here, this should all be independent of the head so

351
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
that all looks correct as well.

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,600
And the DDT Bob update still happens in here, all of that seems

353
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,600
reasonable.

354
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,200
So I think we just have to make sure that I didn't mess up, something

355
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
in this code.

356
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,300
When we snap the head in the body, we come down through here.

357
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,900
We are updating the

358
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,100
Adds sort of idea of where it is and then we come in and say if we got

359
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,700
a body which we know is should be true, right?

360
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,500
Maybe it's not.

361
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
I should double check, but I'm pretty sure it should be.

362
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
I guess I should.

363
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,400
double check to see that we are not hopping or I should say planted

364
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,500
Because otherwise, I'd keep sort of setting it back, right?

365
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,900
So if we look here, we can say that.

366
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,300
The head Delta is based on these things and I guess I suppose,

367
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I suppose those things actually now can stay down in here.

368
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,600
As you can see, it's kind of a little tricky like to figure out

369
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,300
exactly where I want everything because each thing is going to kind of

370
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,500
is going to want to be potentially split apart but yeah, I only want

371
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,200
to do the move.

372
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,700
I only want to update to a hop if I'm standing obviously so that has

373
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,000
to.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Yeah, that has to be changed this copy in works fine.

375
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,000
As does all the rest of this I think so.

376
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,700
Should be good to go.

377
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,900
So we're almost there but we are slammed code.

378
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,500
Now that actually a shears us is not always operating properly which

379
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,700
that code right.

380
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,800
Is I put it in the planting code here, but I guess that's not what we

381
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,400
should do.

382
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,900
I guess that we wanted to have

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Happen, always, which makes sense because you want to be continuous,

384
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,400
right?

385
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,400
I want to be able to set up by the floor, displace in the y-axis and

386
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,000
stuff continuously as we go.

387
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
So that should probably be stuck outward, right?

388
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
So I'm going to go ahead and put this up here.

389
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,900
I'm going to say that head Delta equals nothing.

390
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm going to say if we have a head we will compute the head Delta

391
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,900
and then, this code can

392
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,600
Update based on that.

393
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,200
Always, because why not?

394
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,400
And so, that's back to the way we were doing it.

395
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,100
Now, except now, the choice to hop is being made by the head, right?

396
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,000
The head is basically telling the body, you should hop, okay?

397
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,000
So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to the code for

398
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,200
the head and I want to now kind of collapse these together, right?

399
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,500
Because we were doing, we're doing double get closest reversible on

400
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,100
the head right now and so I just kind of want to make that into one

401
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,800
code path.

402
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
So, try to think of how this should work.

403
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,000
Exactly.

404
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,000
I guess I still want to start off doing the same thing that I was

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,800
doing which is to say that I guess I don't really need the concept of

406
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,600
the closest P because it wouldn't happen outside this anymore.

407
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,000
It only happened inside.

408
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,300
So when I come through here and say, get closest reversible, what I

409
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,400
want to do is I want to, you know, entity is head.

410
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,800
Obviously, I still want to get that and say, is there a new closest

411
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,900
reversible to the one that I to a different one that I was on before?

412
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,700
And what I want to do,

413
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,100
Now is I want to actually compare those so instead of before where I

414
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,800
was just like oh is where's the point relative to my body or stuff

415
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,200
like that?

416
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,700
I want to say is the closest reversible, the one, the body is standing

417
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,400
out or not, right?

418
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,500
And furthermore, I suppose this code should probably be

419
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Well I'm going to I'm going to do too, but I'm going to do it in two

420
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,000
sections.

421
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm not going to try to merge them just yet.

422
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,100
So what I want to do is say, all right, if there is a body, then I

423
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,300
might need to do something.

424
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,600
If it's not that I'm headless, I'm just a floating head, right?

425
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,200
So if there's a body attached to me, what I want to do is say, well,

426
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,100
is the traversable that I found is that reversible and I'll do a test

427
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,200
like are equal.

428
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,000
if this reversible is equal to the one that the body is standing on,

429
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,500
Then I don't really have anything to do because the traversable that

430
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,400
the head would want to be on top of and the one of the bodies on top

431
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
of are the same.

432
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:59,000
If they're not the same, that's when I actually start to care, right?

433
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,300
So if they're not the same, then I want to started to do this stuff,

434
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,000
right?

435
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,600
I want to do this.

436
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,500
I want to basically say all right I don't really know that I care

437
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,000
about this.

438
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,500
I just want to say straight up whether whatever the body Delta is none

439
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:17,900
of that stuff.

440
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,300
None of this matters anymore.

441
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,700
What I want to say is if they're different right?

442
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,900
If the two of them are different, don't even care about any of this

443
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,300
either.

444
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm just saying straight up if I'm not standing on the one that my

445
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,700
head's on top of then I want to do the movement, right?

446
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,000
I want to move to the traversal, I found in the hopping mode, right?

447
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,100
And furthermore, I can probably set this out which is to say

448
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,200
That if the body is not in the movement mode, if the body is not

449
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,600
planted, if it's already in the process of hopping, then there's not

450
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,900
much I can do, right.

451
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,800
So leave it that way, okay?

452
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,300
You no longer need to do this.

453
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,500
We can let that code flow through and it should work actually quite

454
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,000
the same as it was working before.

455
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,600
And we don't need to do any of this anymore or at least I don't

456
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,000
suppose.

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,500
We should, we can still sort of do any updating we wanted here.

458
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Oops.

459
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,900
So we'll leave that as is

460
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,600
So now we just need a couple of helper functions.

461
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,200
What's going on here?

462
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Closest P.

463
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,900
So that just, I guess we do want to copy that one piece of code.

464
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,000
That was getting the locate, the actual location of the traversable.

465
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
I'm going to move this over here so I'm not behind my head so much.

466
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,300
I can't see the code.

467
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Do we never get that?

468
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,200
I guess, we don't know.

469
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,400
Oops.

470
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
so if we go here, too,

471
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,700
The code will be a reversible I guess the closest p is now just

472
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,200
whatever that traversable P is.

473
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,800
Right.

474
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,700
So in here where we were using closest Pi can just do closest P equals

475
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,000
traversable P, right?

476
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,900
Is equal.

477
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,400
Now is just a thing that we need to do in the end of the code.

478
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,300
When we have these traversable references, all we need to do there is

479
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,600
just say like okay,

480
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,500
These will be equal.

481
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,900
If they are the same entity in the same index, very very

482
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
straightforward, right?

483
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,400
So the result equals, you know, entity pointer

484
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,200
Oops.

485
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,200
A three-pointer equals B entity pointer.

486
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,700
And a entity.

487
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Index equals B entity index and a entity.

488
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,800
Sorry, index equals B index.

489
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,400
Now technically, I only have to compare

490
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,400
The end of the index or the entity pointer because they're actually a

491
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,000
union.

492
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
So I suppose what I'll do is I'll just compare the one that would ever

493
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,400
be larger of the two I suppose.

494
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,400
But what I really want to do there, just say compare, the holes sighs,

495
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,000
the whole thing and I'm not really sure of the most way to do that of

496
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the best way to do that.

497
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,500
So I'm hoping in the compiler.

498
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,800
Would just figure it out.

499
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
You know.

500
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,500
But you know, if it doesn't, it doesn't, it's not going to be a big

501
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,900
cost or anything like that.

502
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,600
So, let's see the ID does not operate, sorry.

503
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,100
We've got to do value there.

504
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Okay.

505
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
P is not it's not.

506
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,700
I thought it was.

507
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,600
I guess I have to call get some space because to wrestle I guess I

508
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,700
have to call get some space.

509
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,200
So now we should be doing this the same stuff we're doing before but

510
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,800
semantically, right?

511
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,200
And in theory, nothing should change.

512
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
And it doesn't look like it did.

513
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,500
Right?

514
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,000
So because we haven't put in any logic other than closest point.

515
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,700
So closest point will still be exactly what happens always.

516
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,400
So yeah.

517
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:53,700
So now what we need to do is actually put in some Logic for whether or

518
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,600
not you should be hopping based on how far you're pushing the head

519
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,700
away from the body, right?

520
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay.

521
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,400
So in here, right, what I want to do is I think what I want to do now

522
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,900
is actually start going back towards the sort of

523
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,700
the the head Delta concept which is to say that

524
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,700
when we get the closest reversible to the head, I guess I actually

525
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:37,300
want it to be the closest reversible cast downward would be the first

526
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,500
thing.

527
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Like I want it to actually be relative to where the head is.

528
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,900
The thing that I'm having trouble understanding, right, is the head is

529
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,100
should be at the same point as the body.

530
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,600
So I guess, I'll be honest, I don't really understand why it's ever

531
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
this code.

532
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,700
I feel like shouldn't be picking

533
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,500
I feel like this code should not be choosing to move.

534
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,600
to be honest with you because I feel like the head

535
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,700
Is not a B is in the same place as the body.

536
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,600
So when I cut, right?

537
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,600
Because remember the head is, is a weird bitmap right now.

538
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,800
And so the ground point for the head is still in the same place I

539
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,300
think.

540
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,400
I mean, I can double-check that, but I'm pretty sure.

541
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,500
So technically these two should be calling the same function, right?

542
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,000
I'm not calling the same function but they should always be picking

543
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,400
the same point and I don't know why wherever getting that that choice

544
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,100
to jump to something else,

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
That's real confusing to me.

546
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,300
Furthermore, it's like kind of confusing what's happening to with the.

547
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,500
Yeah, I just, I think.

548
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,600
So I'm going to say that that's not an artifact of how we're choosing

549
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:01,800
it.

550
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,100
I'm going to say that's just a bug.

551
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,500
And so I'm going to investigate that like a bug because I don't think

552
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,200
that should be happening.

553
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,000
So, the first thing I want to do is I want to know where these

554
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,500
entities actually are.

555
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,000
I want to know where their their actual ground p is right?

556
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
And so the I might draw it, but I might also the first thing I might

557
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,300
do is actually just debug value it, right?

558
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,100
So, in hero head, I want to do debug value.

559
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
And I want to do that in.

560
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:33,700
In.

561
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Where is it here?

562
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,300
A body as well.

563
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,500
So yeah, let's see.

564
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,500
So it's behaving roughly like I would expect so far, which is to say,

565
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,000
the bottom one is, obviously the body and you can see that it moves

566
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,200
when it hops and it comes to rest on the correct position.

567
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,100
The top one is a spring.

568
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,300
So it like, relaxes back to that exact position eventually.

569
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,900
So now let's hop on here and see what's going on.

570
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,200
I mean, those points are just real real close, right?

571
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
I mean, they're really just not that different.

572
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,900
So why is get closest reversible picking?

573
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,000
Something different there.

574
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,300
I don't know.

575
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,900
So let's take a look because that's that's important.

576
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,100
I think that's a bug.

577
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,600
May being it closes reversible.

578
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,400
Or at least in the way I'm conceptualizing.

579
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
How this thing is working.

580
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
So I don't want to go any further till

581
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,100
Have that sorted because that's just obviously bad.

582
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,300
So yeah,

583
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,900
All right.

584
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,900
so, let's go over to

585
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,200
Handmade some region.

586
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,000
And let's look at closest reversible.

587
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,500
So here is get closest reversible.

588
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Here's how it works.

589
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,400
We Loop through the entities and we Loop through their volumes.

590
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
We call get some space traversable.

591
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,700
We look to see, I don't know, we still call it head to point which is

592
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,200
good.

593
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Let's maybe call that two point.

594
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,400
And then, let's take a look at what's going on here.

595
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,500
So there's two point.

596
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,600
First we're going to do is we sort of did this thing for fussing with

597
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,200
the Z.

598
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,200
Let's take that out of the equation, temporarily because if we still

599
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,300
get the bug with that, that at least then we don't have to think about

600
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,000
whether that was involved, right?

601
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,400
Good.

602
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,100
So it has nothing to do with our crazy like preferential treatment.

603
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,100
We're just getting something unusual happening.

604
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,100
So looking at this and we get the since faced reversible.

605
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,600
So we look at those that to point p.

606
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
P - from P.

607
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,199
We take a look at the length squared.

608
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,000
We look to see if that looks for is better.

609
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,000
We then snap the entity pointer and the index.

610
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,100
And we update the closest distance squared to be whatever it is that

611
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,199
we expect it to be and that makes good sense, right?

612
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,699
So, that looks pretty reasonable.

613
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,400
So we're probably going to step through that and see what's going on.

614
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,400
Let me do one of the thing.

615
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,100
What I would like to do as well, is in World mode here, where we've

616
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,600
got this entity siming happening.

617
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,600
When we call get closest reversible to the Head.

618
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's just actually call it on the body instead and see what happens

619
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,500
there.

620
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,700
So now, we're not even using the head point.

621
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:16,200
So the Divergence between the head point and the body point is not

622
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
even relevant anymore, right?

623
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Oh right, I can't do that until I actually get over there.

624
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Can I do matter?

625
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,400
Not a problem.

626
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,200
I'll just use livecode reloading, which is so awesome.

627
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,800
All right, so let's go ahead and

628
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
change this to body.

629
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,400
Hop on there.

630
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,800
We can pile.

631
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,700
Oh man, he hopped off before.

632
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,500
I could do it.

633
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,100
There we go.

634
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,500
All right, so maybe I use Loop Live code anything to do this.

635
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Poop.

636
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,500
There we go.

637
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
So now I'm going to change this to body, so now the dude can't move.

638
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,900
And now I'm going to restore the loop point so that we're on there.

639
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,400
Whoa.

640
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,100
Yeah, we have a crazy bug.

641
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,800
It looks like it's, it looks like the Z values for our entities are

642
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,600
not getting packed properly.

643
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,400
I'm kind of glad we've got this caught in a loop.

644
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
Now we can actually debug it to right.

645
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,600
It looks like what's happening is that point is getting levered up

646
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,600
somehow into a different region like the Z packing is not working.

647
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,100
You know I'm saying.

648
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,400
Let me take a look at what's going on there.

649
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,900
Because maybe that's actually both bugs.

650
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,000
So, here is n Sim and some has this chunk Delta thing.

651
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,900
And what happens with the chunk Delta is we basically add it in before

652
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,300
we pack our entity down.

653
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm not sure this.

654
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,100
That's a good place for that for obvious reasons, because we actually

655
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,700
should be doing that in the pack code, right?

656
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,100
I mean that's exactly that's that's the third thing that we do in the

657
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
pack code but let me find the bug first before I go making changes.

658
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,800
So in here you can see we take the region World chunky and the region

659
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,500
origin.

660
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,200
This is the chunk that entity is being stored into.

661
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,900
This is the origin of the same region and that Delta, right is the one

662
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,000
that we want to remove.

663
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,900
If we're subtracting.

664
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,400
That junk Delta off and let's also go kind of back here and just

665
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,000
double check.

666
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,800
So in here we update the camera that shouldn't really matter because

667
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,400
the camera doesn't change that chunk Delta anywhere, right?

668
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,700
So the fact that the camera gets updated here isn't really an issue

669
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,100
and doesn't really matter to us.

670
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,900
So then we come back in here and we do our, we do our MVP Plus chunk

671
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,500
Delta and then we pack The Entity into the world.

672
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
And that seems fine.

673
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,900
So if I come over,

674
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,400
Because I wanted to point out one of the thing so it's also not just

675
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,400
the hero who is moving.

676
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,700
It's actually the point they're standing on.

677
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,500
So it's actually that entity that's getting packed wrong to begin

678
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,400
with, OR getting moved incorrectly.

679
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,100
So we don't even have to look at the standing on part of the hero, so

680
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,300
we can take the hero out of the situation entirely, which is nice,

681
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,200
that makes sense.

682
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay, so when this is being packed, I want to go into the world code.

683
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,000
And take a look at pack pack pack in a trunk.

684
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,900
So here's back entity into chunk.

685
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,600
And essentially what we do here is we just pack the references but we

686
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,500
leave the rest of the data untouched.

687
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,600
I guess I don't really know.

688
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,600
We pass the world position at.

689
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,700
And we're passing entity pee.

690
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,200
an entity pee and chunk PR the same thing in this case,

691
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,700
Right.

692
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This is the map chunk map into chunk space.

693
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,300
It's basically just asking which chunk The Entity should be stored in,

694
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,600
right?

695
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,000
So we're saying hey if this is the or the chunk around which your

696
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,100
stored currently and here is the entity

697
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,500
Give me that Delta.

698
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,700
I'm sorry - tell me, where

699
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,500
That would actually be now.

700
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,800
How is that code even working?

701
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,900
Because we haven't looked at that in a while you're there.

702
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,100
So that's taking an offset that's dividing by the chunk Tim.

703
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,000
as taking a look at the tile and the tile relative portions,

704
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,700
Yes.

705
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,800
Oh really

706
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,500
I mean really this all seems at this point.

707
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,400
Quite a bit overblown as well.

708
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,900
Because really all we need, here is an F mod, right?

709
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,500
We're just asking how many tiles over in X.

710
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,800
This thing went, how many tiles and why, and, how many tiles and Z,

711
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,300
right?

712
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,000
So this is this is just three F mods.

713
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,900
so, it may be time to

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Start cleaning this up a little bit as well.

715
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,400
Let's think about this.

716
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,700
So, when we re canonicalize coordinates here, right, we kind of did

717
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,200
this and it's a bit sloppy, right?

718
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,800
The way that this works is we're taking whatever the world position.

719
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,700
This this base posed was right?

720
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,800
And when we do map into chunks Space, by the way, I don't even know.

721
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,600
Like, how many people even care about that.

722
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,000
Let's go.

723
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Let's go figure out who's using this, right?

724
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,000
So the simulation uses it and I'm assuming that this is just too yeah

725
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,700
that's just to figure out where the bounds are.

726
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,400
We use it in the packing case we were talking about and we use it

727
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,500
similarly to move the camera.

728
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,300
Right.

729
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,700
And then the only other time we use it is when we're building the

730
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,300
world.

731
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,000
So very few people ever care about this and really yeah, the chunk

732
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,900
position from top position really just uses it because it needs this

733
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,800
additional offset thing, right?

734
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,200
Yeah.

735
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,700
So, I feel like we should clean this code up.

736
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,800
That's what I think we should do right now.

737
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,100
So, what we really need when we're doing, that's not where I wanted to

738
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,500
be.

739
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,500
What we really need when we're doing this re canonicalize and I assume

740
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,200
that we canonicalize is only used here as well, right?

741
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,600
Yeah.

742
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,000
All we're really doing here is saying, well, whatever this offset was

743
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,500
Jimmy.

744
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,400
whatever this offset was we want to

745
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Figure out how far that offset would move us from the base pose,

746
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,400
right?

747
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,600
And we want to compute a combined offset, right?

748
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,500
So we have like a total offset and that's whatever the base pose

749
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,900
offset is.

750
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:07,700
A plus h offset, however, much that actually is now in the future, I

751
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:10,900
think world position, I think we're going to get rid of offset from

752
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,500
that, and it's just going to be the three indices and they're only

753
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,600
going to be stored in the chunk.

754
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,100
So I think that's going away eventually anyway.

755
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,100
So like I said, it kind of want to we probably won't need this plus

756
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
offset so it'll just be the total offset.

757
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,900
Will just be equal to this, right?

758
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,300
So now if I want to know how many of these, how many steps I'm going

759
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,500
to

760
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,600
Take right.

761
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,100
If I want to know like what my D chunk X is because this is what I

762
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:36,700
want to know.

763
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,200
Right then all, I really need to do here is some kind of a modulus.

764
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:51,000
I just need to say whatever, however, far I was moving.

765
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,000
I guess I shouldn't say modulus, modulus is the wrong term, I just

766
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,200
want the integer divide, right?

767
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,800
I want the divide and floor, right?

768
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,200
And you can see that we're doing that here, essentially, but

769
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,800
we're sort of doing it in a,

770
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,400
I think what sort of a somewhat busted way anyway.

771
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,200
Saying modulus was not quite correct.

772
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,600
So, what I want to do here is I want to say, I just need to know how

773
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,800
far this would have moved me from my current base pose, right?

774
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,500
Because I'm at wherever that is, how many tile lengths would I go,

775
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,400
right?

776
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,400
And I can figure this out here.

777
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,400
what I can do here is, I can figure out this tile Delta

778
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,100
I should be able to say, well, whatever the Delta is, right?

779
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,400
If I've gone half the distance, right?

780
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,900
I get one of them and then for every one after that, I got another

781
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,100
one, right?

782
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,100
So like the first point five gets me to the next tile, and then after

783
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,600
that, I get, I have to go one each time, right?

784
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,400
So what I kind of want to do is just add Point 5 and then divide right

785
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,000
if I just add .52, it first.

786
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,500
So that if it was point five, it would have rounded up to one.

787
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,000
That's all I should really need to do and then I can just use a

788
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,500
standard truncation from there, right?

789
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,600
I just can use truncate towards zero and that should be fine.

790
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,900
So I guess that's why we were using round before.

791
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,800
So now that I think about it, this code I was thinking that was going

792
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,200
to be easier.

793
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,800
This code is actually not too bad, right?

794
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,900
This is It's using round because whatever the Divide was it's going to

795
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,400
round to one way or the other so that that seems okay.

796
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,400
And then it's adding the however many that was to wherever the tile is

797
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,600
that it's taking whatever the relative amount was and subtracting off.

798
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,800
However much it actually did go, right there should be a little

799
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,700
clearer here that this is a floating Point.

800
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,600
That's a floating Point multiplication, right?

801
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,200
Using Word of the

802
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,100
chunk Dimension is and then well I don't know.

803
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,900
With restarting just to double-check that make sense.

804
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,100
So that actually does seem now that I go back over at that actually

805
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:52,300
does seem reasonable, it's not as weird as I thought it was at first.

806
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,500
but,

807
00:47:59,600 --> 00:47:59,900
I still.

808
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Make sure that I don't have anything weird going on here.

809
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
And that seems all right.

810
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,200
So the reason thing that was throwing me off is this is the plus

811
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,000
equals here, right?

812
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,700
It's like oh okay.

813
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,200
I see.

814
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,600
So the reason we're treating we're doing the delta in here which is

815
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,800
why we weren't talking about Delta's out here.

816
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:24,700
That's okay.

817
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,400
And so similarly, I guess we should double check our subtract here.

818
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,500
So our subtract is looking to see what the difference in tiles is

819
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,000
between the two things and then it's multiplying that by however, big

820
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,600
the tiles are which seems reasonable.

821
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,700
And then it's looking at the, a offset - the be offset, which is the

822
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,400
Delta between

823
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:43,900
Offset.

824
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,400
So that also seems, right?

825
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,800
So that seems pretty good.

826
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,300
Do we use this function anywhere?

827
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,700
Looks like, no.

828
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,200
All right, hmm.

829
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,200
So yeah, I guess we're gonna have to step through this somehow, figure

830
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
out, what else?

831
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,300
I don't see just just, you know, sort of looking vaguely at it.

832
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,100
I don't see what the problem is offhand, unless I'm missing something.

833
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,600
I feel like this is probably working.

834
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,100
Okay.

835
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
Famous last words.

836
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,900
Char relative of a chunk, Tim is going to round.

837
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
Does that work in the negative Direction correctly?

838
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,500
I think it should right, because chunk Tim's, positive, towel rail,

839
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,800
the tower relative motion.

840
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,200
Be - you would get a negative number, which would be a negative offset

841
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,200
after the round, which is what you want.

842
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,700
You add that in, you move that direction, the towel relative amount

843
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,200
again, you you just subtract off, and that'll work, - lie correctly.

844
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,700
So,

845
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:16,000
seems right, we're passing the right dimensions for everything and

846
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yeah, I don't see anything particularly wonky.

847
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,200
So that's it.

848
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,600
Yeah, I think that seems that seems reasonable.

849
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,500
If that makes sense.

850
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,600
All right, so let's think about what I can use for debugging strategy

851
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,900
here because if it's not a mapping problem, I'm not sure what exactly

852
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,600
it is.

853
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,600
And so, yeah, I feel like I can probably, you know, it's moving by

854
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,500
that Delta.

855
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
So it has to be

856
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,900
Thing with getting the wrong chunk Z.

857
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:00,700
Right?

858
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,200
It's like Levering onto the wrong chunk Z or something.

859
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,800
It would seem at least, that would be my assumption, so

860
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,100
yes, so assuming that

861
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,800
Assuming, that's not that I suppose, when we actually look at the map

862
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,500
into chunks pace and wondering if there's maybe something, if the, if

863
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,100
it picks the well, let's take a look.

864
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,000
So I'm going to go into some region and I'm trying to think if there's

865
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,800
a likes it that's a hard case to find.

866
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,900
I'm trying to think if there's any way I can figure out some sort of a

867
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,400
more specific way of checking whether something discontinuously moves

868
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,800
from one frame to the next in a way that we don't,

869
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,600
Expect, but it's kind of a hard thing to figure out how we would

870
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,500
detect that case, you know what I mean?

871
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,500
So in here, when we unpack The Entity, we take the chunk Delta by

872
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,500
saying wherever the origin of some reason is we want to move it out to

873
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,600
whatever the chunk position is the chunk position is just at the XYZ

874
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,400
of that chunk, right?

875
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,500
And that's seems totally what we would expect.

876
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,500
We take whatever the p-value is the comes in and we offset it by that

877
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,000
chunk Delta, right?

878
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,100
So that's fine.

879
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,900
What?

880
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,400
I don't know.

881
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,700
Why is Adam T taking the chunk, Delta?

882
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,200
So it adds there.

883
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,800
So the Sim space p is this is just used as a check, but then add into

884
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,100
the does the chunk Delta Edition?

885
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,100
Yes.

886
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,600
All right, that seems reasonable as well.

887
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,000
And then the M Sims same thing, the chunk Delta is inverted and it's

888
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,800
added so it should cancel out.

889
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,600
Assuming the chunk is the same, if the chunk isn't the same.

890
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,200
Well, that's okay, that's still that mapping is still supposed to

891
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,700
work.

892
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,100
So let's try this.

893
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,200
Let's try this.

894
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,800
So when we call pack entity in Two Worlds, I'm going to say that pack

895
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,300
energy into world.

896
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,900
Much try to verify what ends up happening.

897
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,700
So packet of the into World here, we call get World chunk, right?

898
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,300
And then we do the packing.

899
00:53:59,400 --> 00:53:59,800
What I want.

900
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,700
Is after I do this packing.

901
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,900
Would I get the same thing out again after like doing the test?

902
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:13,700
So basically like I want to test the and I want to say, well if I were

903
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,900
to call map into chunks pace,

904
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,500
Or, I guess not mapping trunk space.

905
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,100
I should say, if I do the reverse mapping after The Pact.

906
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,900
So if I say, well, exactly what I was doing here.

907
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,600
And I say, okay, here's the chunk, Delta, I want to subtract whatever

908
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,800
the chunk position is and I know what that is, right?

909
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,000
It's the entity pee.

910
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,900
And that doesn't include any offset, right?

911
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,500
It's just the XYZ.

912
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,500
No, it doesn't.

913
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,200
No, it definitely does not.

914
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,100
You see the bug?

915
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,900
Or at least, do you see a bug?

916
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,900
I see a bug.

917
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,700
Someone was being sloppy.

918
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
And that's something was me.

919
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,600
This is not the chunk P, right?

920
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,500
Oh, okay.

921
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,600
No, I guess I wasn't sloppy.

922
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,900
I'm going to say this is not the time to the trunk.

923
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,300
PS.

924
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,300
Have the offset removed from it, but it does have the Oxford movement.

925
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,200
All right, never mind.

926
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,800
Never mind, I was about to have to hold up the owl.

927
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,200
Shame.

928
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,200
I probably still will have to hold up the Elder shame, but in this

929
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,900
case, no, no shame yet, I did zero it out.

930
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,100
Okay.

931
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,800
So the chunk Delta is the difference between the chunk p and the Sim

932
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,500
origin.

933
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,700
And then the test fee is just whatever.

934
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,000
The entities p-value is now.

935
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,200
Plus that new chunk, Delta or reverse time Delta I should say

936
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,300
Right.

937
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,600
And I'm just interested now to know, right?

938
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,700
Because when we do the pack entity in the world is going to have that

939
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,000
same P from the P value that came in here.

940
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,200
Oh,

941
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,700
but this should be chunk P, shouldn't it?

942
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,700
So that kind of still was a bug because we're packing it into at that

943
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,400
chunk pee.

944
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,600
Let me double-check that.

945
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,400
Still busted.

946
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:35,700
So

947
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,400
no harm done.

948
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,200
How is the chunk?

949
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,200
How was that code working?

950
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,500
Anyway, let me take a look here.

951
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,500
It doesn't use.

952
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:45,700
Okay.

953
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:45,900
Yeah.

954
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,800
So it doesn't use the offset, so that's fine.

955
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,400
Okay, so I want to enable this test.

956
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,300
I basically want to say, hey, when I do the subtract groups

957
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,100
when I do the subtraction,

958
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,800
I was some region on.

959
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,800
And identifier.

960
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,300
Yes, I've called it region in one place.

961
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,200
The same region, another.

962
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:04,800
Not sure why.

963
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,300
So, what I want to do here is after this, I want to do an assertion on

964
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,400
the entity p.

965
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,200
X equal, the equaling the test p.x

966
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,600
and I want to see if this fires

967
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,500
and I guess, honestly, I don't really need to check the X and the Y,

968
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,200
because Z is all.

969
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,900
I'm really caring about right now and so I want to see what happens

970
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,200
here.

971
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,900
So, let's take a look at the

972
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:36,900
And that's right.

973
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,400
That's not a quite what I wanted.

974
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
Hold on a second.

975
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,700
But I actually wanted was.

976
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,600
To save what it was before we did the mapping.

977
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,400
And then to check that mapping.

978
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,600
Like this.

979
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,800
That's what I actually wanted.

980
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,400
Hmm, you know what?

981
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,300
Unfortunately, I got to stop and restart but we don't have the bug

982
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,800
reap rowing.

983
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,200
So you know what I can do, what I might do is inside win32 handmade

984
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,700
since we have that recording saved, I'm going to go ahead and just

985
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,600
play it back, right?

986
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,700
So at startup

987
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,400
Where does that stuff work?

988
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,500
It's been so long since we implemented that we never did a thing that

989
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,700
actually allows the replays to go, right?

990
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,800
Went through to get input file location.

991
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,400
Found a stray file.

992
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
Create always.

993
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,000
So it clears it out here.

994
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,300
Potentially well, no because it wouldn't create it, if it already

995
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:21,800
existed.

996
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,300
So that's okay.

997
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,800
Well, wouldn't collaborate presumably.

998
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,900
So then we get the max size.

999
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,700
Create a mapping.

1000
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,800
And we show the memory block.

1001
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,400
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start here.

1002
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,600
I'm going to take that Loop edit.

1003
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,300
Which is this one and I'm just going to duplicate them.

1004
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,400
Just so I have a copy in case we mess it up, right?

1005
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,200
So I've got this copy here.

1006
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,500
That makes sense.

1007
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,800
And then what?

1008
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
To know, I guess is, when I push the L key.

1009
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,000
Which is here.

1010
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,100
Can I just make it so that we start playing one instead of begin

1011
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,600
recording?

1012
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,400
We just do begin input playback State one, right?

1013
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,500
And maybe I just make this be if it's shift.

1014
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,500
so, maybe I'll say something like,

1015
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,200
you know, if input playing index is 0,

1016
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
and,

1017
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,100
We kind of need a little bit more logic in here.

1018
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,300
We could actually hook this up to our debug and make some buttons for

1019
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,900
it which would probably be what we would want, right?

1020
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,800
But what I would like to do here is just say, like okay, if you know,

1021
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,100
maybe the shift key is down which I think we could do pretty easily,

1022
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:09,400
right?

1023
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Because I feel like we probably would have shift.

1024
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,700
Do we ever do that?

1025
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,700
We have ALT key was down.

1026
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,000
We never did shift, I guess.

1027
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,100
Put alt he was down up here for now.

1028
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:33,000
And so now we'll just do if all tell is pushed off we go, right?

1029
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:38,000
So if ALT key was down, this is just my little backdoor for now.

1030
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,300
We will do

1031
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,100
Begin input.

1032
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,200
Playback of State 1.

1033
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,400
That was underwhelming.

1034
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,100
Why did that not work?

1035
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,100
It definitely is playing it back.

1036
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,100
So the question is, do we erase

1037
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,100
Let's take a look no we don't erase right, that's the same file.

1038
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,500
And that's the same file.

1039
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,300
Oh no, I selected the wrong one.

1040
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,100
I selected the wrong one.

1041
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,900
I'm an idiot.

1042
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,000
All right.

1043
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:48,500
Well,

1044
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,300
That is a feature.

1045
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,400
We should actually.

1046
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,600
Implement, because it's very useful, right?

1047
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
It looks like I copied the wrong one.

1048
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,900
Now that doesn't explain why this doesn't work but I suspect it's

1049
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:10,800
because we clear on Startup and I don't currently preserve old replay

1050
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,000
buffers which we would want to do, right?

1051
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,200
It looks like in here get input file location.

1052
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:19,700
Should be fine, right?

1053
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,300
And

1054
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,700
It's going to be the same every time the file handle.

1055
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,800
Generic read, right?

1056
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,400
I don't feel like it would clobber the file.

1057
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,500
When we create the mapping.

1058
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,600
In map view of file, I feel like it should just be the file, right?

1059
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,000
It feels like that should have worked because I don't think we delete

1060
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,400
them.

1061
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,800
If that makes sense.

1062
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,400
So I'm kind of curious as to why that doesn't work.

1063
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,100
Let's blow these away for now.

1064
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,600
So if I am to do something here,

1065
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,800
I'll do Elle.

1066
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,200
And elegant.

1067
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,500
So now we clearly are in a loop.

1068
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,200
Right.

1069
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,300
And I can unloop us and now we're out of the loop.

1070
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,100
And so now should all tell should play that back, right?

1071
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,300
Yes.

1072
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:32,600
So the problem is on Startup, we must be clearing those somehow,

1073
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,100
right?

1074
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,700
Because if I instead startup fresh,

1075
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,800
And put all Dell.

1076
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,500
Now, it works.

1077
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,100
So I guess I must just not have hit all tell.

1078
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,800
Oh,

1079
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,700
it's in the win32 platform layer.

1080
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,400
That doesn't live reload.

1081
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,900
So we now have the ability, we did it, right?

1082
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,400
It's just, you can't patch the wind through two layer at runtime, we

1083
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,200
probably should have done that, but what can you do?

1084
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:02,800
All right.

1085
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,800
So that's fine.

1086
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,600
I'm okay with that.

1087
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,200
It's not a hard bug to Repro.

1088
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,700
Let's go ahead and

1089
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,100
And re-enable the hopping so I can hop mr.

1090
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,000
Hoppy over there, right?

1091
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,800
So I'm going to go to handmade World mode and I'm going to go down to

1092
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,700
where we have the head Hopper, mr.

1093
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:21,400
Head Hopper.

1094
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,800
Oops, we go and do.

1095
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,800
Do do do.

1096
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,000
I totally forget where we were even doing here.

1097
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:45,400
So yeah I was doing in here by move mode.

1098
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,300
We do is equal for traversable 's and that should allow the hero to

1099
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:57,800
hop around right and but the heroes not hopping at the moment.

1100
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,600
At all.

1101
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,900
So, I must have disabled something.

1102
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,400
I don't remember what I disabled.

1103
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,800
It's been a long day.

1104
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:16,900
So in here, when I'm all this stuff looks right and the hero body

1105
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:21,500
stuff is still correct, right?

1106
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,000
And it moves

1107
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:24,800
All of that.

1108
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,800
Looks okay.

1109
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:52,700
It's all right.

1110
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,600
So tell me why I can't hop.

1111
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,100
Yeah, that's true.

1112
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:02,500
We did exceed the maximum velocity, but I want to know why I can't

1113
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,000
hop.

1114
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,700
So thank you for actually generating, that break point because now I

1115
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,300
can go in here and actually find out

1116
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,400
Where are we?

1117
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,300
Let's see hero head.

1118
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:25,400
So I am going to say, let's go to here hero.

1119
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:29,000
And let's continue running.

1120
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,100
No.

1121
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,700
Just do set next statement and go.

1122
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:41,100
So let's see, I'm going to go ahead and look in here and see what

1123
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,500
happens when we pick the closest reversible.

1124
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,600
Presumably it is not equal to 0.

1125
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,700
It is, it does think it's equal.

1126
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,900
Oh, right, that's what I disabled.

1127
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,800
Body Tea.

1128
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,800
Okay, let's try that again.

1129
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,400
Getting old.

1130
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:04,800
So yeah, that's right.

1131
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,200
I was just looking at body P here.

1132
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,700
All right, so let's go ahead and hop onto this little dude.

1133
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:34,899
Unfortunately, that was not as nice and pronounced as the other bug

1134
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,200
was.

1135
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,100
So try that.

1136
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,100
You know, and the more I'm thinking about this, it's got to be the

1137
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,300
camera motion to because if without the camera motion, it doesn't

1138
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:50,600
happen.

1139
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,500
Like that point.

1140
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,399
Doesn't work out at all.

1141
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,700
In fact, that is why he's jumping off even is because it's wigging out

1142
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,200
when the camera moves with him.

1143
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,300
So, it is only when the camera moves that this is relevant.

1144
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,500
Which again really suggests the packing.

1145
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:22,899
Hmm.

1146
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:26,100
So I guess it's we're way over time so I'm gonna have to call it here

1147
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,399
but we pretty much know exactly what our culprit is.

1148
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,800
We just have to do bug to find the specific cause but the packing is

1149
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,000
definitely the problem because if you're not on there to move the

1150
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,399
camera which is the only thing that can actually affect the simulation

1151
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:45,100
region origin,

1152
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,300
You can't get that to happen, right?

1153
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:54,900
So, something about the way this is working, is not correct.

1154
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,800
Something about it.

1155
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,700
And we know that the entity is mapped into that space.

1156
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,800
It has a residual offset on it.

1157
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,900
So we actually already know as well.

1158
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,300
In fact, this chunk Delta thing.

1159
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,100
Is not even really how we would normally compute that, right?

1160
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,900
What we actually want is to say, well, this already has the residual

1161
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,600
in it now, right?

1162
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,100
So entity pee.

1163
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,700
that offset is actually the value that we

1164
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,300
want to know versus the old entity P, right?

1165
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,300
So in other words, wherever the dude was before

1166
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Verses where you're telling me, he is now.

1167
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,200
Right?

1168
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,100
Is the amount we have to move all of his positional information.

1169
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,800
If that makes sense, because basically, I want to take him from this

1170
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,500
value to this value, so this is really not necessary.

1171
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,400
In any particular situation.

1172
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Sorry, I'm obsessing about this a little bit.

1173
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,000
So let's see test fee older to P.

1174
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,300
So now we can kind of look at this or except I'm totally off here.

1175
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,800
Reverse chunk, Delta packing it into world.

1176
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Shrimpy.

1177
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,600
Well, actually, you know what, I want to?

1178
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,500
I want to debug this first.

1179
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:11,800
So I'm going to, I'm going to take this part here and Nerf it for a

1180
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:17,300
second while I work on this because this should wig out until I get it

1181
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:17,800
proper.

1182
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:18,200
Yeah.

1183
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,000
So when I do, let's see, let me just look at what Chuck did chunked

1184
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,900
out is actually used for.

1185
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:30,000
So it's only used for nadp+, so if I want to, I don't know why there's

1186
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
a negative there, that's probably the problem.

1187
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,500
Yeah, so that's the known stable value.

1188
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,100
So the question is, does that also caused that procedure cause the

1189
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:43,500
problem?

1190
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,100
Yeah, so we still have the same problem of it doing that crazy Delta.

1191
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
So we have two independent methods of both produce the same thing

1192
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,600
which is a good thing, right?

1193
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,700
Because I can verify this, this is actually that I'm doing what I

1194
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,300
think I'm doing, but I'm still getting the problem.

1195
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,100
So there's something going on here with when the camera moves.

1196
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,900
The pack unpack is not proper.

1197
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,400
I hate to leave it for the weekend, but

1198
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:17,600
I mean, I think this is going to require us to dig in and actually go

1199
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,100
verify a bunch of stuff, so, I don't know.

1200
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:23,000
I mean, I guess it's something that all of you can go solve over the

1201
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,900
weekend if you want to.

1202
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,800
So, that's kind of interesting, but it's one of those things that's

1203
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,600
going to drive me nuts.

1204
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,400
What to do what to do.

1205
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,400
I look at it a little more.

1206
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,600
I don't have to go right away so I got like it cook it, a little

1207
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,200
longer

1208
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:51,700
So re-enabling this this is just a test to verify, oops, that when I

1209
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,400
pack and unpack immediately, I get the same thing.

1210
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,300
Right?

1211
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,800
And those deserts aren't firing.

1212
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,800
So always in the moment the pack works.

1213
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,700
Okay, which kind of suggests to me that it's the fact that when the

1214
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,600
camera changes, we don't unpack to the same place like the camera

1215
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,200
itself.

1216
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:16,700
Says region information is somehow busted which I don't know, maybe

1217
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,200
implies this code is not correct.

1218
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,600
Here we are, grabbing out the world chunks, right?

1219
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,100
And when we grab out the world chunks, I suppose, you know, one thing

1220
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,800
we could do is assert that the world chunks are what we think they

1221
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,100
are, right?

1222
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,000
So we could like, assert, if we get a chunk, we could obviously add

1223
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:40,800
some assertions in here.

1224
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,400
Just say, hey, we got the right chunk, right?

1225
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,100
So you know, chunk

1226
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,700
If you look at what this code does, it's got X Y and Z in there,

1227
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,000
right?

1228
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,300
So I can insert the chunk x equals the chunk X.

1229
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:58,300
That's junk.

1230
01:14:58,300 --> 01:14:59,800
Why junkie all equally

1231
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,700
They're just to make sure that we don't have some weird thing with our

1232
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,700
hash table or something which seems really unlikely.

1233
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,600
But you know if you don't know what the bug is that obviously none of

1234
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,800
it seems likely so you might as well check everything.

1235
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,000
So that does not appear likely and so then when we come through here,

1236
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,300
we create a chunk position.

1237
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,000
That's at the center of that.

1238
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:34,800
We look to see what the chunk Delta is going to be from wherever the

1239
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,200
simulation origin is to the position of the chunk.

1240
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,800
And that's how we're going to displace everyone which seems right

1241
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:46,700
right.

1242
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,100
I'm at the you know there's the origin is the origin of the Space

1243
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,400
Shuttle coordinate system obviously.

1244
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:56,500
So I need to figure out how to move somebody away from that, right?

1245
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,600
So that seems right.

1246
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,100
I Loop through all the entities.

1247
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,100
I test them with the Sims face P, but then I come in here to do that

1248
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,600
ad Envy call where I passed the chunk Delta.

1249
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,900
And when I passed that chunk, Delta, that's just something that gets

1250
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,900
added directly.

1251
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,100
So, here it is.

1252
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:27,900
The p-value, I add in that, chunk, Delta and off, I go, right?

1253
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,500
Really not complicated.

1254
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,600
So

1255
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:39,200
I'm not sure why that would be a problem.

1256
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,400
I don't have a lot of ideas on that.

1257
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,700
So when I'm moving the entities out,

1258
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,200
And then I'm moving them back in.

1259
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,000
I guess the first and well, I guess the other thing that's kind of

1260
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,700
weird is, we know this doesn't happen.

1261
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,700
I guess if in other directions either, right?

1262
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:33,800
Or does it?

1263
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,100
I guess we don't really know.

1264
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,400
Because we aren't walking across other screens at the moment.

1265
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,400
Right.

1266
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,300
So it doesn't look like we're getting that kind of crazy displacement

1267
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,000
here at all.

1268
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,800
I can reach out over there and you know, I don't get when the camera

1269
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,500
does do that.

1270
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,500
Do its transition?

1271
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:17,400
I don't get any issues there that I can perceive anyway.

1272
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:22,500
So, it's only easy that appears to be problematic.

1273
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:38,200
It's so it has to be moving camera, has to be Z and you can see that

1274
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:41,800
when the flicker happens, it is when it changes to the other SIM

1275
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,400
region, because you can see that band, right?

1276
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,500
The yellow band signifies the same region in her apron.

1277
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,900
You can see it flashing to the lower one.

1278
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,700
So we've got this dead to rights in terms of what's going on.

1279
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,100
It's really just a question of what did we screw up in the math?

1280
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,100
And why is it only on Z which is also kind of weird, right?

1281
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,700
Because we've got the same code substantively.

1282
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,400
We haven't really compress it down quite yet, but we've got the

1283
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:15,200
substance of the same code happening in both cases.

1284
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:28,900
And it's not clear why we would get a situation where one of them is

1285
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,300
It significantly different.

1286
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,200
I suppose, another thing we could do,

1287
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,200
Just for some additional information.

1288
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,000
Is while we're in Crazy Land.

1289
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:55,400
I could go into the camera and make it be not room base anymore.

1290
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,700
And now, let's see what happens.

1291
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,300
Well, that's just a minuscule amount.

1292
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:08,200
So that's not very helpful.

1293
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,600
That's just an Epsilon problem.

1294
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,300
Probably,

1295
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,100
Although I suppose maybe an Epsilon up now that looks like a really

1296
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:21,600
big jump.

1297
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,300
As I say maybe an Epsilon problem isn't enough, but I don't know.

1298
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,600
Okay, so we have a pretty clear answer there, right?

1299
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,500
Like, look at that.

1300
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,600
Although, you know, it's kind of weird about that too.

1301
01:20:58,900 --> 01:20:59,500
Is.

1302
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:06,200
That is a tremendous amount of Z of visual Z offset for hardly any

1303
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,800
actual Z offset.

1304
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,400
Right.

1305
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:24,800
I guess we're only seeing the, the camera we need to.

1306
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,500
We need to add the camera in here as well, right?

1307
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,800
When we do the same region, I want to see what the camera actually is.

1308
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,400
So during begin Sim because the camera must be constantly moving down,

1309
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,700
is basically what must be happening in that case.

1310
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:47,700
So the Sim region origin in this case, I guess I'll just say origin

1311
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,400
dot X or something.

1312
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,400
Dutch uncle, Rex.

1313
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,500
And I guess I'll just output these as debug values.

1314
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:17,300
And then I'll also output the offset, which would be always 0.

1315
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,000
So here is some information for us.

1316
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,500
Here's the same region, origin, the chunk portions right.

1317
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:39,200
And I'm going to go ahead and switch to the the non room base camera,

1318
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,100
right?

1319
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,800
Oh man.

1320
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,000
All right.

1321
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,900
Well, let's go here.

1322
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,400
So you can see what's happening there, right?

1323
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,400
We're super Levering downward.

1324
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:02,900
That

1325
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,100
That chunk.

1326
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:15,500
Oh,

1327
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,900
Wait a minute.

1328
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,000
Is this even a bug?

1329
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,100
This isn't even a bug.

1330
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,100
I can't believe.

1331
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,500
I just spent that long.

1332
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,500
Something that isn't even a bug.

1333
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,700
That's actually just what I threw in.

1334
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:37,600
At the end of the day, the other day for testing, which is totally

1335
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,300
bogus.

1336
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,800
If I'm right about this, that is so sad.

1337
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:48,500
So sad.

1338
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,300
So remember, we threw in the stupid floaty thing that you stand on.

1339
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,800
Well, that thing is just hard coded.

1340
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,600
Where'd he go?

1341
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,400
That's not him.

1342
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,800
Here, he is that things just hard.

1343
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,200
To set the Z.

1344
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,600
So it's just going to set the Z, always down to whatever, it's going

1345
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,300
to set it to it.

1346
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:10,800
If the camera, if the camera moves down, it's going to just move down

1347
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,200
because this is not actually moving by any legal method, right?

1348
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,900
It's not actually doing any actual motion.

1349
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,700
Oh, that's horrible.

1350
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:26,100
That's horrible.

1351
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,000
Horrible.

1352
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,400
That's absolutely awful.

1353
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:33,700
ah,

1354
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,100
I'm gonna put an owl shame on top of a now.

1355
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,000
Shame for that one.

1356
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:55,300
All right.

1357
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,800
So you guys see what's happening there?

1358
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,100
That's awful.

1359
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,500
Well, I'm glad we stuck around to find it because that would not be

1360
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:02,800
one.

1361
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,400
That was worth saving for the weekend.

1362
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,500
And it does bring up a problem with our system that we would probably

1363
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,100
want to think about.

1364
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:12,900
So it's not like it's the worst thing in the world but that's pretty

1365
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:13,300
dumb.

1366
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,400
Alright?

1367
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:19,600
So the problem here is just that hey, we've got a relative coordinate

1368
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,300
system so you've got the camera and people are in it, right?

1369
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,500
And they move around in it and they're like, okay, I moved to here.

1370
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,100
And so, then later on, we just packed them back and say, oh well,

1371
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,700
however, far you were away from that.

1372
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,600
Origin is fine.

1373
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:32,900
And so, then later,

1374
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:38,300
It's not a big deal because when we have like the camera for example,

1375
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,600
and I should draw this a little bit better.

1376
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,200
So let's let's do it, across two frames.

1377
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,100
So here's frame one, right?

1378
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,900
And here is where this world chunk is on frame 1 and I record where

1379
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,900
this guy is in that chunk, right?

1380
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:55,500
And then later on frame to, if the camera moves this way, right?

1381
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:58,200
That slides this trunk over, and that's fine.

1382
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,700
Because it's still reconstructs his position and everything's good,

1383
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,300
right?

1384
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,100
The problem is, if somebody this

1385
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:04,800
Coordinate.

1386
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,300
Right?

1387
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,100
Is always measured from the center of the simulation region.

1388
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,500
So when I, when I unpack him out of the chunk I put in there,

1389
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:14,700
Right.

1390
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:20,400
But that floaty thing, which is straight setting of where it where it

1391
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,800
wanted to be and so it was a sign in screen space, so if the camera

1392
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,300
moved, it just kept being lower because it's like, hey, I'm always at

1393
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,000
negative 1.

1394
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,300
So, when the camera move down - one, it was like, where are you now?

1395
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,000
It should have been 0.

1396
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,400
It's like, no, I'm still negative 1, right?

1397
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,900
So no matter how far down the camera moved, that stupid thing was

1398
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,800
always like I'm further down the new.

1399
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,900
I'm still further down further fought for that, right?

1400
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,500
It's like something.

1401
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,800
That always says, it's on the left of the screen and no matter how far

1402
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,200
you move the camera, that way it still says on the left of the screen.

1403
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,800
And so you just Chase it all the way and you never get anywhere.

1404
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:54,400
Right?

1405
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:57,600
And so the reason I say that brings up interesting problem with the

1406
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,800
way that we're doing the system is I guess if we want

1407
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,600
Something to kind of float up and down.

1408
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It brings up kind of an interesting question which is it seems like we

1409
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,700
want to be able to specify offsets separate from

1410
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,000
That are going to be packed properly.

1411
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,500
Like, we might want to be able to specify an absolute sine wave,

1412
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,000
right?

1413
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,000
That's something we might want to do.

1414
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,600
Now, in the meantime, we can always just say, like, oh, you know, well

1415
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:27,200
we can just do this as some kind of a Delta, right?

1416
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:33,600
And so we can just say like oh it's you know, it's going to be not an

1417
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,300
absolute position or something like this.

1418
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,500
So we can you know, we can sort of get around it by using controllers

1419
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,600
that don't work that way and

1420
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,600
Say what the trick is that I just did in a minute there because it

1421
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,200
might be not obvious why that works.

1422
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,300
But now, if I kind of come up onto this dude here, we shouldn't ever

1423
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,600
have this problem anymore, even if I make this guy pretty wonky, it

1424
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,000
should still still work.

1425
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,100
Yeah, so that's that's more what we're looking at here, right?

1426
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:09,100
And let me go ahead and try to think of how I might want to do this.

1427
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:12,100
So I probably wants to be cosine actually.

1428
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,600
So it doesn't start out with a bias.

1429
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,100
Let's go ahead here.

1430
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,500
And I guess we probably wanted a little bit more, huh?

1431
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,900
Let's let's let's give it a big old swing.

1432
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,000
I can't believe that was the bug.

1433
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,900
That's absurd.

1434
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,300
All right.

1435
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:45,400
And yeah, so what I did there, right is the reason one of the

1436
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,500
interesting things about sine and cosine we haven't really talked

1437
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:52,600
about it too much on the serious, but one of the interesting things

1438
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,000
about them as functions, right?

1439
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:59,600
Is that sine and cosine are their own derivatives, right?

1440
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:05,600
So this is just sort of the, the nature of that unit circle.

1441
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,900
If I start off here, right?

1442
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,400
My sign value.

1443
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,800
Of this is 0, right?

1444
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,100
And my cosine value of.

1445
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:22,200
This is 1, right?

1446
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:28,100
If I go, you know, along here and I go up to here, let's say right

1447
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,300
then.

1448
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:32,400
I've got a signed value of one and a cosine value of 0 and so on and

1449
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:33,200
so forth, right?

1450
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,800
Well let's suppose and, you know, we can just keep filling it out.

1451
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,400
So here's cosine of negative one, hears sign, oops, sorry.

1452
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:45,900
Sine value of zero cosine, value of negative one.

1453
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,500
And then down here, we have cosine.

1454
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,500
Sorry signed value of negative 1.

1455
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,900
Cosine value of 0.

1456
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,800
Well what happens if we actually plot these as vectors right?

1457
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,900
Because I've got, you know, if I could think of

1458
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,500
These vectors, I've got a vector pointing this direction.

1459
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,900
The vector pointing that direction.

1460
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,100
A vector pointing this direction in a vector pointing that direction,

1461
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:06,600
right?

1462
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:11,700
Well those vectors smoothly go around the circle, right?

1463
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,500
The whole time.

1464
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:16,100
And so at any time that Vector is a sexually tangent to the circle

1465
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,600
Well, if I wanted the perpendicular right, which would be the

1466
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,100
acceleration along the circle at that point, right?

1467
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,500
I'm accelerating in this direction.

1468
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,800
If I wanted to accelerate around the circle to find what was

1469
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,200
essentially something that goes in plane of the circle rather than

1470
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,700
sort of extending out from it.

1471
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,100
If I wanted that right, we know what that would be.

1472
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,200
It's just a perp, right?

1473
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:43,100
We know that the perpetrator perpendicular, operator of this Vector,

1474
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:43,300
right?

1475
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,800
That's that's going around the circle.

1476
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,600
And we know what the perpendicular Vector of something is right.

1477
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,900
If we have a perpendicular of X Y, then it's just going to be equal to

1478
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,400
y - x, right?

1479
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,200
Or depending on which one we want to do - YX right?

1480
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,100
We can have it pointing we can do the perpendicular clockwise or

1481
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,800
counterclockwise depending on which one we want to do.

1482
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:05,500
Well if that's the case right?

1483
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:05,800
Then if

1484
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,600
A vector is sign or this case is cosine sine or something like this,

1485
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,400
right?

1486
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,700
The derivative of that or sorry, that not the derivative should say.

1487
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,100
But the the we haven't quite gotten there yet.

1488
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,700
The direction sort of that on the outside is just going to be, you

1489
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,500
know, negative sine cosine or something, right?

1490
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,700
It's just going to be depending on which direction I want to go.

1491
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,600
And in this case it would be.

1492
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,600
Let's see which one it is.

1493
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,200
So I want it to be going up, right?

1494
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,500
So that's 0 cosine should be going positive, which it is and sign

1495
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:35,700
should be.

1496
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,400
Going backwards and negatives, right?

1497
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:41,800
So this is the 14 going counter clockwise around the circle, right?

1498
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:44,600
So, hey,

1499
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,600
If I want to know how I would accelerate a point such that it goes

1500
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,500
around a circle.

1501
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,800
If I know the function for putting me on the circle happens to be sine

1502
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:58,600
cosine.

1503
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:02,700
I know the acceleration that moved me around the circle was - I'm

1504
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:04,400
sorry it wrong.

1505
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,200
Again was cosine sine?

1506
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,100
Which is the point that travels around the circle.

1507
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,400
I know that negative sine cosine right?

1508
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,200
Is that acceleration around a circle.

1509
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,600
Now this is just a long sort of geometric way of looking at the fact

1510
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,500
that if you ever just look up in a book you will see something that

1511
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:28,800
says, you know, the if you have a function of theta and that equals

1512
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:33,100
cosine of theta, then the first derivative of that equals negative

1513
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:34,700
sine of theta, right?

1514
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:41,300
And the same is true if you have a function of sine Theta, right?

1515
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,400
The derivative of it is cosine,

1516
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,000
Well, that's why geometrically, right?

1517
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,900
That's the geometric reason for why is because, hey, it's still just a

1518
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,000
circle, right?

1519
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Because you can think of it.

1520
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:58,900
You can think of cosine sine as just assert a vector pointing out.

1521
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,800
You know, that comes out to the

1522
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,600
Well, that just goes around.

1523
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:05,000
Well, if you wanted to figure out what the acceleration was, or I'm

1524
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,700
sorry the velocity was all around, right, you just do the same thing,

1525
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:09,300
right?

1526
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:12,400
You just you just, you still want a vector that moves around.

1527
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,900
You just want to start it pointing upward instead of pointing

1528
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:16,300
outwards.

1529
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,600
So you're just taking it and rotating that Vector 90 degrees and off

1530
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,400
you go, right?

1531
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,800
Which is the perpendicular and hey, that's exactly what we end up

1532
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,100
seeing when you do it.

1533
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,600
Knowing if you knew what the derivative was ahead of time.

1534
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,700
So all I did was I was like, oh, I

1535
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,100
Want this thing to be based on something that isn't absolute.

1536
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:34,700
So I can shove it into our system.

1537
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,400
And so, all I did was I just said, oh, okay, just take the value and

1538
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,000
make it be less and then just use that as an acceleration, right?

1539
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,500
I'm velocity, right?

1540
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:48,000
I did not use it as a celebration.

1541
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,300
I'm not I'm not incrementing to the DeeZee here.

1542
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,600
I'm just using it as a velocity directly write

1543
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,900
But again, it would be the same for acceleration because, no matter

1544
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:04,900
how many times you take the derivative, it still gives you the same

1545
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:06,300
results, right?

1546
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:08,200
They are their own derivatives.

1547
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,200
So it's like, if I start out with cosine Theta and I'm like, that's my

1548
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,800
position.

1549
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,800
Then when I take the derivative of that,

1550
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,500
Right?

1551
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,300
I get Negative sine Theta if I take the derivative of it again it's

1552
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,700
exactly the same thing right - cosine Theta because we already know

1553
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,800
the derivative of sine is cosine so I can keep going and going and

1554
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,800
going, right?

1555
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,700
But the position, the velocity, the acceleration, the acceleration of

1556
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,000
the acceleration and blah, blah blah, right?

1557
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,000
It's always going to be cosine negative sign.

1558
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,800
Negative cosine, sine cosine, negative sign, right?

1559
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,700
It's just going to be that repeating all the way down to wonder how

1560
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,800
many time you take the derivative over and over and over and over and

1561
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,600
over and over and over and over.

1562
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,200
Right?

1563
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,500
And as pseudonym 73 is on the channel.

1564
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:52,500
He'd probably talk to you about something like e to the I Theta or

1565
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:56,200
something like this or how these things mapped complex numbers.

1566
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,900
But I'll be honest with you that stuff is so not in my wheelhouse.

1567
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,100
I'm not going to try but

1568
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,400
Point being Math is Fun.

1569
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:05,900
Let's go shopping.

1570
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,800
All right, so that's it.

1571
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:10,800
That's it.

1572
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:12,500
That's all I have to say.

1573
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,300
Really.

1574
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So let's go to Q&A.

1575
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:56,900
Mmm.

1576
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:08,200
Clemens, boom.

1577
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,100
Wow, that is not a non topic.

1578
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:15,200
Question, is there a geometric explanation for the quaternion sandwich

1579
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,900
Product?

1580
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,100
Where does the formula?

1581
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,800
Q times P times, conjugate, Q come from

1582
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:32,200
So I guess I could tell you where it comes from algebraically, but I

1583
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:35,600
guess to be honest, I've never thought of where it comes from

1584
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,200
geometrically.

1585
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,800
You should have asked me 15 years ago and I probably could have told

1586
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,500
you well not told you but I probably could have figured it out.

1587
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:56,900
I'll tell you what, hold that thought for a second and let me answer

1588
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,200
mr.

1589
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,400
Fourth Dimensions question, because that's actually on topic.

1590
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,400
I'm a bit unclear on why the relative positioning of Z worked is z

1591
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:08,600
rebased summer in the code, actually, everything is rebased, right?

1592
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:10,900
So everything works properly position.

1593
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:15,700
Wise, the only thing is that you have to actually treat positions that

1594
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,600
come through.

1595
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,800
Well, okay, let me I can explain it much more simply, really

1596
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:24,400
the only reason this code didn't work because because that

1597
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:26,200
Right.

1598
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,900
No amount of rebasing is going to help you, if you clobber, the

1599
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,500
rebased value with a new value.

1600
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,300
And that's what we did here, right?

1601
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:39,600
So whenever we're out putting values, we can't just treat them like

1602
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,500
they're the same as they were last frame because they might be

1603
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,300
different.

1604
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,400
Now, they're not different in terms of what they mean but they're

1605
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,300
different in terms of their numeric value because they might be based

1606
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,500
on a different starting point, all the rest of our code works because

1607
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,300
it's all based on

1608
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,800
I use that get rebased.

1609
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,700
Everything is in terms of values that get re based in this code.

1610
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,800
This is and this both get rebased.

1611
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:06,200
So we don't have to worry about cold, setting entity P2 something.

1612
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,700
Because when we cold set and ep2 something, we're setting it to a

1613
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:12,200
function that's in terms of other rebates values here.

1614
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:15,600
There is no re based value on the right hand side of this equation.

1615
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:20,300
So, we just clobber a rebase value with an on rebase value and Havoc

1616
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:20,800
ensues.

1617
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,400
Zach see I'm still quite new be.

1618
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,900
I'm pregnant but wouldn't comment in your code a bit more help in

1619
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:38,800
situations like today.

1620
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,700
I mean, I'd say the obvious, I say the opposite, I would say if you

1621
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:47,100
watch what just happened on the stream, no amount of comments could

1622
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,500
have possibly helped me.

1623
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,500
And the reason for that is because the line of code was something we

1624
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,100
added on a previous day.

1625
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:57,300
That is not even in the region where we were reading.

1626
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,800
So we would never even if we had a comment in here,

1627
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,500
Like this is fucked.

1628
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,700
Like let's say we knew I'm not us around spring, this is bad.

1629
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,200
Let's say so even had a comment that was like, this is bad.

1630
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,400
We would if those of you have heard me, talk normally, I swear

1631
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,200
continuously.

1632
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:17,800
So how we have gotten away with.

1633
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:21,700
I think only three swears on handmade hero so far is beyond me but I

1634
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,800
wanted to try and keep it relatively clean for children anyway.

1635
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:30,200
So basically what happens is, even if we had a comment in here that

1636
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:33,300
even if we knew, which I didn't know when I, when I was writing it, I

1637
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,600
didn't even think about that.

1638
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,200
Otherwise I wouldn't have written in the first place.

1639
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:36,700
So even if

1640
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,400
How I known even then if I'd added a comment that was like, hey, by

1641
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,000
the way don't do this.

1642
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,400
We never looked at this code.

1643
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:47,700
So there's basically like and this is the, this is true of basically.

1644
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,300
All of the things that I found in my life regarding comments, which is

1645
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:56,600
that comments are really only useful when you're completely done like

1646
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:59,200
basil, when you're completely done with the code and you're wrapping

1647
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,500
it up, right?

1648
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,400
You need to go and write a comment was like, here's how this worked

1649
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:09,200
because later, when you go back, you're going to have to read that,

1650
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,100
comment and go, okay, and I get it.

1651
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:14,300
Anything else that you comment on is just you're wasting your time

1652
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:15,600
because you're not going to be the comment.

1653
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,700
Comment, get out date.

1654
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:19,200
And then, if you start trusting the comments, they're probably wrong

1655
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,000
because you probably change something.

1656
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,400
I forgot to change the comment.

1657
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,400
So I say never comment till you're done with a section and then put a

1658
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:27,300
comment at the top of that section.

1659
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:31,200
That's like, hey here is a good description.

1660
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,500
of how this algorithm and code and stuff is supposed to work because

1661
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,000
later when you come back,

1662
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,500
you need to do that.

1663
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,300
And Cuba Caleb.

1664
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,600
Yeah, I think it was only three squares are not in the pre stream

1665
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,500
because the priests room is fine.

1666
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,100
But in the regular stream I thought we only have three.

1667
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,900
If you can find more than three, let me know.

1668
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:50,200
I thought I thought this would have been number of swear.

1669
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,700
Number four, I think.

1670
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,500
I think there were three previous ones.

1671
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:54,900
I don't know.

1672
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,300
I can't quite remember.

1673
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:05,400
Long billion.

1674
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,100
So not only did that bug affect the floating thing going to high low,

1675
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,800
but it also is the cause of the head, picking the wrong point and the

1676
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,900
body jumping to it.

1677
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:12,800
Yes.

1678
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,400
So what was happening there?

1679
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,000
Right.

1680
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:20,900
Is that, when that when that point got, well, let me just draw it for

1681
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,100
you.

1682
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:24,900
So here's what was happening.

1683
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,400
Let's let's view this from the side.

1684
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:34,900
Okay, here's the hero.

1685
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:36,600
They're standing on a point.

1686
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,600
Here's the head.

1687
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,300
Here's another Point next to him.

1688
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,200
Here's another Point next to him, right?

1689
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:45,500
And this is the point right now that we're on here, is the zero line.

1690
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,600
Let's say this is not actually quite right.

1691
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,300
It's not the exact wasn't quite at the zero line where these points

1692
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:50,400
were.

1693
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,800
It's a different location, but doesn't that doesn't matter for now.

1694
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:57,200
And this point is getting displaced downwards by that Z equals sine

1695
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,000
Theta function, right?

1696
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Here's what happens now on the next frame, okay, everything is rebase

1697
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:05,400
properly.

1698
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:08,500
So we're looking through that same situation, but this fellow right

1699
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,800
now we sort of have a change in where the camera is.

1700
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,800
So the camera now comes down to here, all right, these guys are still

1701
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,300
at the zero line, and that's fine because they all get displaced

1702
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:19,700
properly.

1703
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:23,000
So their relative positions are like this, so does the hero so he's in

1704
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
the right place, but this guy right, even though he gets replaced, he

1705
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,700
gets rebase to his peas in the right place.

1706
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:29,800
He then Club.

1707
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,100
Purrs his pee, with this displacement again, which drops this point

1708
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:36,100
down to here, right?

1709
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,600
So, is that it was here, now, all of a sudden isn't telling, it's

1710
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,000
there.

1711
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,900
Now, we ask, what's the closest point to here?

1712
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,600
Well, it's not this one anymore, it's this one and snap that causes

1713
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,500
the guy to jump, right?

1714
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,200
So it's very, very straightforward.

1715
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,900
But, you know,

1716
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,900
Until you actually find a bug, it's always like what?

1717
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:00,600
so,

1718
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,700
the mind of raw.

1719
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,600
What if you really wanted to set an absolute vision for energy?

1720
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,600
How would you handle that?

1721
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:22,300
Well, it's actually not hard because we have the chunk mapping system.

1722
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,100
So, if you want to store an absolute position, you can just store an

1723
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:28,100
absolute position with one of these world offsets, right?

1724
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,100
You can just put one of these

1725
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,400
Store.

1726
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:38,400
Actually one of these and then every time you just call Matt and then

1727
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,000
you get it out.

1728
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,700
You called map into some space or whatever.

1729
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:44,200
So it's not actually hard to do it's just that's not what we were

1730
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:44,700
doing.

1731
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,000
so,

1732
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,700
All right, so it looks like we don't have questions so I'll try to

1733
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,800
think about Clemens bombs question.

1734
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:08,400
This is not a question which anyone on the stream?

1735
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,900
Probably would have any idea what I'm talking about because we've

1736
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:14,100
never covered quaternions on handmade hero to the best of my

1737
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:14,800
knowledge.

1738
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,900
But and it's been so long that it's really I have not really done

1739
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:25,200
anything with quaternions and probably like seriously 10 years

1740
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,200
probably more like 12 at this point.

1741
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:33,000
so I don't think I'm probably gonna be very helpful, but

1742
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,800
so, the question was,

1743
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,200
And comments about correct me if I'm wrong.

1744
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,800
But the question was, where does this sandwich you called it a

1745
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,900
sandwich product?

1746
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,700
And the sandwich product you're talking about like qpq inverse, right?

1747
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,500
And what this is here is like these are quaternions

1748
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,900
And this is technically also, a quaternion in some sense.

1749
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,100
But oftentimes, when people are talking about this, this is actually a

1750
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,500
vector that's been extended into a quaternion.

1751
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:18,500
And is this is this basically, the core of your question?

1752
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,600
Like, tell me I'm going to wait for the chat a little bit here.

1753
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,700
Tell me if this is what you were talking about.

1754
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,100
Okay, so comes on confirmed that that is the question.

1755
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,000
All right?

1756
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:01,600
So

1757
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:09,500
I'm trying to think about how to to illustrate this.

1758
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:14,900
So I'm going to start with the algebraic way to think about it and

1759
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:16,800
then I'll try to come up with a geometric one.

1760
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:24,200
Now, you may already know the algebraic reason for this and and if it

1761
01:46:24,200 --> 01:46:27,600
is the, and if, you know the algebraic reason for a ready, then I

1762
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,100
apologize, but I'm going to have to work through.

1763
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,700
It is, like I said, it's been so long since I've worked with these

1764
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:35,400
that I can't just pull it out of my head at this point, so the out

1765
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,900
Rick reason for this, is if I mean, I'm assuming again, like I Tsum,

1766
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:40,800
you already know this, but I'm just going to say it anyway.

1767
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:43,600
So this is actually the similarity transform.

1768
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
I've never heard it called the sandwich product.

1769
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:52,800
But but essentially, this is not specific to quaternions, right?

1770
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,500
It's not really a quaternion thing.

1771
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:55,900
It's just a spatial.

1772
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,300
It's a, it's just a

1773
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,900
It's a frame of reference thing and you'll see it in everywhere, it

1774
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:03,500
exists.

1775
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,700
Even if you could probably, if you went into looked into like the

1776
01:47:06,700 --> 01:47:10,100
tensor math or gravitation and stuff, you would see the same stuff

1777
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,500
happening.

1778
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:14,500
It's not specific to quaternions in any particular way, right?

1779
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:14,900
I guess what?

1780
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:15,400
I want to say.

1781
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,600
So you could think of this as also being how you do with matrices.

1782
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:25,700
So, if I had a matrix B and I did this equation to it, okay?

1783
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:30,000
Totally separate from quaternions just straight-up matrices.

1784
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:37,000
The same intuitive process is happening in both cases in both cases,

1785
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,300
it's called assembly similarity, transform again as far as I know, in

1786
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:42,800
either case called similar transform and in both cases it means the

1787
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:43,400
same thing.

1788
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:51,400
And what it means is Tell me the meaning of thing be in the space of

1789
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:51,800
thing.

1790
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:55,000
A and so in quaternions, if I was to do these the same rate, I would

1791
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,500
say there's the

1792
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:57,600
Be quaternion.

1793
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:59,700
And the a quaternion, right?

1794
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,200
And here is what it is, right?

1795
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:05,500
It's the Abba transform, it's the dancing queen.

1796
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:06,900
So

1797
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,100
So first off I'd look this up, right?

1798
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:15,800
I'd say if my explanation doesn't help you at all which like I said

1799
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,400
because I'm so Rusty, it probably won't.

1800
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,100
You can do a lot of reading on the similarity transform and somebody

1801
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:24,000
out there is going to have an explanation that resonates with you.

1802
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,200
I would suspect.

1803
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:29,400
So if you were looking for sandwich product, maybe that didn't help.

1804
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:32,400
But similarly transform, I think, should I would be shocked if you

1805
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,900
couldn't find a good explanation on simulator transforms because

1806
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,000
they're ubiquitous, they're everywhere and they're very important.

1807
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:40,300
so,

1808
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,600
Where does the similarity transform actually come from?

1809
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,400
Now here's the thing.

1810
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,500
Is I could have told you this this would have been second nature to

1811
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:47,600
me.

1812
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,800
While I'm going to have to stumble through it a little bit here.

1813
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:52,100
So

1814
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:02,500
in order to do a similarity transform on something, it helps to think

1815
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,700
about it in terms of what this thing might be transforming.

1816
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:09,500
So I'll try again because it's supposed to be an intuitive explanation

1817
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:09,700
here.

1818
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:13,200
Let's talk about these things, as not as matrices or quaternions,

1819
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:16,200
which says things that represent a frame of reference.

1820
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,000
All right.

1821
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:20,000
And so if I have a frame of reference

1822
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,700
That's out in the world.

1823
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,100
So let's suppose this is x coordinate.

1824
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:29,900
And this is a y-coordinate and we doesn't matter whether we're in 2D

1825
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:31,600
or 3D, so I'll just draw these as 2D.

1826
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,200
That this works in any Dimension.

1827
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:37,200
This is not again, this this is Matrix math, it's not dimensional.

1828
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:41,700
It doesn't care how many dimensions these things have so 2 D, 3 d, 1

1829
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:42,600
D, whatever doesn't matter.

1830
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:49,100
So if I have something and I have an interpretation in that space,

1831
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:49,900
right?

1832
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,800
So here's my point.

1833
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,400
Point.

1834
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,300
And here's my X and my y frame.

1835
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:57,300
And I'm talking about maybe, an origin even and I'm talking about this

1836
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,400
representation here.

1837
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:01,700
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say that I want the

1838
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:05,000
orientation to be the only part that I care about because again since

1839
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,100
this is a general Matrix thing, we don't have to care about positions.

1840
01:50:08,200 --> 01:50:11,200
In any particular way you can just say rotations and if it works

1841
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,600
rotations it works right.

1842
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,300
So if there was some canonical coordinate system great.

1843
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:19,600
But I'm talking about this specific coordinate system here and I'm

1844
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:21,100
going to call this coordinate system.

1845
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:22,300
Be

1846
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:29,200
And here is p and this p is, you know, being expressed?

1847
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,300
Let's say well, I want to talk about where it's being expressed yet.

1848
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:35,100
I'll just simply say that I have this coordinate system, be right?

1849
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:37,900
So, I could create an equation.

1850
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,800
We're I said, assuming that b is expressed in the outer core canonical

1851
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:44,400
coordinate system.

1852
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,600
So this this framers, the screen, if you will, what the screen is

1853
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,500
right now, I've got the slightly tilted thing and then I've got the

1854
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,100
actual screen coordinate system which is here, right?

1855
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:58,900
Well if I wanted to talk about where P was on the screen in the

1856
01:50:58,900 --> 01:50:59,800
canonical coordinate,

1857
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:00,800
Right.

1858
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,800
Then I would have the equation p on the screen right?

1859
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,800
Equals P times this thing because p is in B's space here, right?

1860
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:14,700
This is, you know, you could almost think of it as p in be space,

1861
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:15,300
right?

1862
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,400
P is in the space of B.

1863
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:22,200
So in order to put it into the outer frame of reference, I have to

1864
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:25,500
multiply it by that Matrix or rather.

1865
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:28,100
If we get out of the major sandwiches talk about frame reference, I

1866
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:29,900
have to do, whatever the interpretation.

1867
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,500
Action is whatever that interpretation operator interpret this thing

1868
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:37,400
in my space so that it becomes in the outer space, right?

1869
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,600
And in major, see this very simple, it just matrix multiplication.

1870
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:44,700
We know that we know that if we multiply a point by a matrix, we

1871
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:47,000
transform it by that Matrix, so it's very intuitive.

1872
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
You've done this a million times, everyone knows what it is.

1873
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,100
If there are 3D Graphics programmer and I'm assuming you would because

1874
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,000
you would be asking about quaternions otherwise, right?

1875
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:59,200
So, we know this equation, it's very, very comfortable and this is the

1876
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,400
equation that does that expression.

1877
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:06,000
It puts be out into the outer frame and you could think of it as if by

1878
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,200
noting this a little further, you could say, well, I have in second, I

1879
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:12,700
could eliminate the primes and I could say, well, let's say this outer

1880
01:52:12,700 --> 01:52:16,300
coordinate system will even introduce a letter for it.

1881
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,100
The outer coordinate system is just see, well, I could say that see,

1882
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:24,700
you know p in see space equals.

1883
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,700
Whatever.

1884
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,000
B is encoded in c space, right?

1885
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:31,100
Times p in be space.

1886
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:33,800
Right.

1887
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,400
And what you can think of this doing, if you see the way I've noted.

1888
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:42,200
This is you can almost think of these as canceling each other out.

1889
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:49,500
So if I want to go from b space to see space, I need the be in C, in C

1890
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:50,800
Matrix, right?

1891
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,100
Because when I talk about a frame of reference, I can't talk about a

1892
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:58,500
frame reference without talking about what frame of reference that is

1893
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,600
in, right?

1894
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:01,600
And that's the curse of programming, right?

1895
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:04,600
Is that generically, we can, you know,

1896
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,100
Can talk coordinate free and everything is fine.

1897
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:09,000
But when we actually go to implement, right?

1898
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,700
There's there's what'd what are the actual numbers, right?

1899
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:13,900
We're feeding an actual numbers and implementation time.

1900
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,900
So in the abstract terms, we can talk about the frame of reference be

1901
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:19,200
and we don't really even have to talk about who it's encoded in.

1902
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:22,100
But once we start talking about the minutiae of it, we have start

1903
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:22,600
talking about.

1904
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,500
Well, okay, what what are you talking about?

1905
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:28,100
You say be when you actually encoded that, what did you encode it in

1906
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,300
and while we're talking now about it being coded in c space, right?

1907
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:37,300
So now let's assume that we introduce a right.

1908
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,900
So we're going to have another thing here, that's the frame.

1909
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,400
That's a

1910
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,000
Okay, so that's my a frame.

1911
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:53,200
Now the frame a is a different frame than the frame, be right?

1912
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:56,700
And I'm going to call this a see because I'm going to encode them both

1913
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:57,300
in the sea space.

1914
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,700
So I have a and c space and I have b and c space.

1915
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,900
This is again, adding a lot of things you're like I'm getting confused

1916
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,100
AC.

1917
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:03,900
So sorry, right?

1918
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:04,900
I apologize.

1919
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:07,700
This is just the nature of this kind of problem, but you can think of

1920
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:08,400
that see space.

1921
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,400
I'm just that's just the world space, right?

1922
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,900
This is effectively World space.

1923
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:16,100
It's just a third frame of reference that I'm encoding, both A and B

1924
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:16,400
in.

1925
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:19,000
So, this is exactly what you have in a normal program.

1926
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,500
In a 3D program, you have a 3D Matrix, a a 3D Matrix B.

1927
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:25,300
They're both encoded in World space, right?

1928
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,500
And I'm talking about the two of these matrices in World space.

1929
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,600
Let's say, right?

1930
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,700
So that's why I'm talking about here.

1931
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,900
I've got three spaces and a and b and then there's a c which is the

1932
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:37,700
encompassing space that encompasses both of them, okay?

1933
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:39,800
So now

1934
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:44,600
Let's say, I want to ask the question.

1935
01:54:46,300 --> 01:54:56,800
Well, what if I wanted to know what B was right in the space of a

1936
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,900
So I no longer want B to be encoded in the space of.

1937
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:08,400
See I want B to be coded in space of a and you can imagine this is

1938
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,900
being like a hierarchical, kind of a transform, right?

1939
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:15,200
It's like when you do a bone system and you say like, oh, you know,

1940
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,100
the child bone in the parent bone, right?

1941
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:19,900
Well, the child bone is encoded in the space of the parent and the

1942
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:23,000
parent is encoded in the space of the world, right?

1943
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,000
So you have C is the world.

1944
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,500
A is the is the parent.

1945
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:27,500
B is the child.

1946
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,200
I want to produce that.

1947
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:28,900
Right.

1948
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:33,600
If that makes sense well intuitively, we kind of know what that is and

1949
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:37,700
so we could right off the bat perhaps jump in to writing that and

1950
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:42,600
saying, well, I know that if I want a in, I'm sorry.

1951
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:47,600
I know that if I want be in the space of a then all I really have to

1952
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:52,400
do is make a be the new world coordinate system, essentially, right?

1953
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,700
So we know what that is, right?

1954
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:58,400
It's the inverse of a and C, we just take that inverse of it which is

1955
01:55:58,400 --> 01:55:59,900
basically doing the opposite.

1956
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,200
Transform, right.

1957
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:05,100
And then we can take anything that was in that space and that will map

1958
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:07,400
it into a space, right?

1959
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:09,400
If that makes sense.

1960
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:12,000
Now, why is that doing?

1961
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:12,600
What it's doing?

1962
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:17,200
And we'll sort of get into that in a second here, but you can almost

1963
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,000
think of this inversion.

1964
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:24,300
As swapping these two, right essentially what this transform becomes

1965
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:27,600
now is see in a space in some sense, right?

1966
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,100
It's sort of saying how would I get to see if I was in a right?

1967
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:38,200
So that swaps what these two things mean and again you could read the

1968
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:42,900
canceling C and C cancel and we just get be in a space, right?

1969
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,400
So hopefully this is helping you kind of warm up to where we're going

1970
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:53,600
here, but hopefully, that all made pretty good sense.

1971
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,800
And obviously, like, I don't know what your level of familiarity with

1972
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,000
this.

1973
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,100
But again, like I said, I assume if you're asked about quaternions,

1974
01:56:59,100 --> 01:56:59,600
then your

1975
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Recently comforter with everything I just said and it should be like,

1976
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,700
okay, yes, like that's all stuff I've kind of done before and even if

1977
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:07,600
you maybe didn't think about exactly this way, you thought about it

1978
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,100
and that's relatively comfortable, right?

1979
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:16,800
So it's pretty easy to produce like being a space, or I could have

1980
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:21,700
produced a in B's face, or you know, whatever else, right?

1981
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:27,100
So now, let's talk about that similarity, transform part of it, right?

1982
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:33,100
So now, let's ask the question, what what, what is this?

1983
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:35,900
This weird one that we're talking about here, right?

1984
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:38,800
So we're talking about something where we're like, you know, we don't

1985
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:39,700
know what we're getting.

1986
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,400
We're getting something that you do.

1987
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,400
You're saying, I don't really understand what why it is or what it is,

1988
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:48,300
but I know that it's produced in this way.

1989
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:51,900
I know that I take, you know, these transforms that I have encoded and

1990
01:57:51,900 --> 01:57:52,300
I know

1991
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,700
That I'm that I'm doing that to them, right?

1992
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:02,900
Should be very, very phlegmy.

1993
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:05,400
Hmm.

1994
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:11,500
Okay, so this is the the similarity transform like we said before,

1995
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:12,000
right?

1996
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:16,700
And it's it's going to basically be doing exactly the same sort of

1997
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:19,900
things, as all of these operations were.

1998
01:58:19,900 --> 01:58:23,100
So let's see if we can read it off and see what, you know, it ends up

1999
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,000
looking like well,

2000
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:27,800
First of all, like I said before, when you do this inversion operator,

2001
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:30,000
you're sort of doing the opposite mapping.

2002
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:34,000
So this is really more properly perhaps written in the way that we're

2003
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,300
doing it as see in, you know, in a space.

2004
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:40,800
So I have a and c space times B and C spacetimes see in a space,

2005
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:41,500
right?

2006
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,100
And so if we read the cancels, right, and because remember how this

2007
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:50,200
worked if I had here before,

2008
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:55,000
Russ talking about where if I have p and b space and B and C space,

2009
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,500
right?

2010
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
You can cancel the the small to the large, right?

2011
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:01,100
And we are lining up.

2012
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:06,100
Essentially what's around for

2013
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,600
We're lining up essentially the same thing, but now this time around

2014
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,900
we don't have the same Smalls to the large, right.

2015
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:17,800
They have to kind of carry through because we can't like like we had

2016
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:24,100
before where we would do before you know a in see space b and c space,

2017
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:24,300
right?

2018
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:27,200
Or something like this, there is no cancel that happens here.

2019
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,100
This is just a b and c space, right?

2020
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:31,400
It continues.

2021
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:34,800
It holds if two things that were in the same thing that kind of hold

2022
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:35,300
their there.

2023
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:36,000
See, right.

2024
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:40,100
So these two terms combined together is just going to be the a be

2025
01:59:40,100 --> 01:59:41,600
transformed in see space.

2026
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,600
So this first term we can see exactly sort of what it is, right.

2027
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:51,200
And what it is is the composite of these two, right?

2028
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:55,300
It's doing both A and B so it's doing a first and then be and it's

2029
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,600
like combining the two transforms in see space, right?

2030
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,600
That's what this would be.

2031
02:00:00,600 --> 02:00:01,300
That makes sense.

2032
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,500
And then here, we just have the sea in a space.

2033
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:07,900
So this is doing the opposite of what a

2034
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:12,300
Of what a was doing, right?

2035
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:16,600
So essentially, what we can think of Happening Here is we can think of

2036
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:21,200
this as putting something, that's on this side, right into C's space,

2037
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:27,800
then applying be to it in that space and then reapplying a in the same

2038
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,300
space, right?

2039
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:35,500
So it's like undoing a doing be, and then doing a again to put it

2040
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:36,500
back, right?

2041
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,400
and so, what you can kind of see in this case, and I guess, I

2042
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,900
probably, if I, you know, if I was clever

2043
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:47,300
About how I done this notation.

2044
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:49,500
This would probably actually be

2045
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:55,500
Possible to follow through, trying to think of how I would have noted

2046
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:55,900
that.

2047
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:02,100
I feel like they're probably would have been away since I was writing

2048
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:05,700
these letters down just to keep you to have.

2049
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,100
You be able to remember them?

2050
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:10,200
I feel like they're probably would have been a clever way for me to do

2051
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:14,400
this so that you could actually cancel them out the whole way through.

2052
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:20,000
But I'll be honest, I don't immediately see how you would do that

2053
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,400
because what you want to end up with here, right?

2054
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,500
Is sort of a hmm.

2055
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:29,900
Excuse me.

2056
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,000
The effect of be in c space.

2057
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,700
The effective be as if it was in a space in see space but I don't

2058
02:01:36,700 --> 02:01:37,400
really know.

2059
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,700
Yeah, I have to think about that more.

2060
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,600
Is there some way to, I don't know.

2061
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,200
So I feel like if you were a tensor math person, like I feel like if

2062
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:51,700
you a pseudonym 73, he'd be able to figure out how to notate this.

2063
02:01:51,700 --> 02:01:57,300
So it actually more cleanly, worked out, but Ibis re I can't, I can't

2064
02:01:57,300 --> 02:02:00,100
figure out how you would really think about Crossing these and, in

2065
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:00,500
some way.

2066
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,800
So I'll have to just ignore that for now.

2067
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:04,800
But as I'm doing this, I don't think I've ever written it out quite

2068
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:05,400
this way before.

2069
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,700
So I never really thought about.

2070
02:02:06,700 --> 02:02:11,100
Hey maybe you could make these things actually line up in some way

2071
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:12,700
that produced the result that you

2072
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:17,500
On it but you think you need you need one more like level of of

2073
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:20,300
writing probably to make that happen anyway.

2074
02:02:21,900 --> 02:02:25,800
Okay, so what we're doing here, right is, we're moving something

2075
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:28,100
Jimmy.

2076
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:33,100
We're moving something such that, a is the space that we're now in,

2077
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,100
we're applying be, right?

2078
02:02:36,900 --> 02:02:41,500
And then we're moving back into the to that a space, right?

2079
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
If that makes sense, we're basically undoing that previous transform.

2080
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,700
So if you look at what happened, on the diagram, what would happen on

2081
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:52,700
the diagram here is our A and C space encoded, right?

2082
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We have something.

2083
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,600
If we, if we wanted to talk about some point that we were just talking

2084
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,400
about, right?

2085
02:02:58,300 --> 02:02:59,400
Then the first thing we're doing

2086
02:02:59,500 --> 02:02:59,900
in is we're saying,

2087
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,200
Okay, if that point, let's say that in point is encoded in see space.

2088
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:05,800
So it's actually floating in the screen.

2089
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,400
We first are going to do the inverse of it here.

2090
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:13,100
So we would essentially be moving so that we're in a space.

2091
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:13,900
And you know what I'll do.

2092
02:03:13,900 --> 02:03:16,000
I'll draw these out for you one step at a time.

2093
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:24,700
Alright so here's a and coded in c space.

2094
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:25,500
Here's a point.

2095
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:27,500
Also in coded in c space, right?

2096
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:32,200
So the first thing we do, if we wanted to do this now and I'm going to

2097
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:39,400
just do, I'm going to do a CBC AC inverse right times a point equals

2098
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:40,300
some new point.

2099
02:03:41,100 --> 02:03:41,600
Right.

2100
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:44,000
And I'm going to call it P Prime because we're not talking about what

2101
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,900
it actually is yet since that's what we're trying to discover.

2102
02:03:47,100 --> 02:03:49,600
Okay, so here's my point and see space.

2103
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,300
Here's my frame, a see.

2104
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:54,400
The first thing I do is I multiply by the inverse of that frame,

2105
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:55,400
right.

2106
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,600
So what does that do?

2107
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,700
That takes us from this coordinate system into one?

2108
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:01,900
Where a see is the root coordinate system.

2109
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:05,900
So, this is now a see effectively where it was right now.

2110
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:08,600
This is just a canonical Court, we've undone it.

2111
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,400
So we wouldn't really necessarily call it a see anymore but you can

2112
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:12,600
see what I'm doing, right?

2113
02:04:12,600 --> 02:04:16,700
I'm writing the AC so that it actually occurs

2114
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:21,500
Coincident with the with the outer axes, right?

2115
02:04:23,300 --> 02:04:26,400
So now we would have PC would be like here, right?

2116
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:28,600
Because it would maintain its relative position.

2117
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:30,500
We would warp it back, right?

2118
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:34,500
And now we know that we have BC, okay?

2119
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,300
And BC was this other?

2120
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,900
This sort of slight more slight thing.

2121
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,300
It was right here.

2122
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:44,900
Well, remember we are still applying and this is why I wrote These in

2123
02:04:44,900 --> 02:04:46,700
so I apologize if they're confusing you more.

2124
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:48,800
But I you've got to track him somehow.

2125
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:53,700
Well, B is still in sees face, okay?

2126
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,000
And a is now.

2127
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,700
We're see was right.

2128
02:04:57,700 --> 02:05:00,500
In other words, we've shifted a so that it at is now in C because we

2129
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:02,300
apply the inverse of a and C.

2130
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,000
So we basically moved in to see space.

2131
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,200
Remember because this is now, you know, it's the seat of a transform.

2132
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:09,700
So we've moved into see space.

2133
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:12,400
So a is aligned with C B is in that space.

2134
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:16,800
So we are now applying be as in its normal way.

2135
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:18,300
We did not change be at all.

2136
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,200
We're applying it normally.

2137
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:21,100
Right, and it's the slight tilt.

2138
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:25,500
So now we're going to reinterpret P in that space.

2139
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:27,600
Now what's that going to do?

2140
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:29,500
What's going to move it this way, right?

2141
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:31,200
It's going to tilt it down a little bit.

2142
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:35,700
Okay, so that's what happens after we apply.

2143
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:36,700
So we applied a c.

2144
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:38,600
Now we applied BC, right?

2145
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:40,200
That was it there.

2146
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:45,000
Then, finally, we're going to apply a see again.

2147
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:48,000
Right?

2148
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,400
So we're going to undo what we did originally.

2149
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:56,600
Okay, so what we do now is we move this whole thing back.

2150
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,200
We do this this transform again, right?

2151
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,200
this Transformer again, which slides everything back down and moves

2152
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:09,600
this new Point down here, right to apply that AC back to where AC was

2153
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,700
Okay, so

2154
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:16,800
Hopefully, you can see what that means.

2155
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:25,400
We first move a point into one frame of reference AC, we then apply

2156
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:30,000
the transform that we're talking about here as if it were still in the

2157
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:30,500
world space.

2158
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:31,500
We don't touch it at all.

2159
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:36,700
We do it exactly as it used to work and then we apply a see again,

2160
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:37,800
right?

2161
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:41,000
So, we re move back to that space.

2162
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:43,500
If that makes sense.

2163
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:49,600
So essentially the similarity transform what it does.

2164
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:55,500
This equation, right here, if I have a ba in verse,

2165
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:04,100
then what that effectively gives me is it gives me b as if a world

2166
02:07:04,100 --> 02:07:04,700
space

2167
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:10,700
Right.

2168
02:07:13,900 --> 02:07:14,600
That's what it does.

2169
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:20,300
Now you may ask the question.

2170
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,500
Well why do I care about this?

2171
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:26,000
Because if we now come back to this, right?

2172
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:32,800
And we say well okay that's all great but doesn't this point?

2173
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:36,100
Just end up basically where it would have ended up anyway, right.

2174
02:07:36,600 --> 02:07:40,700
And the answer is in 2D, yes it would.

2175
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:44,400
And the reason why in 2D it would happen is because rotations commute

2176
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:47,000
into d, right Rotation by an angle.

2177
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,400
Just adds in 2D.

2178
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:53,800
So no matter which order, I apply these transforms in, I'm home.

2179
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:54,200
Free.

2180
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:54,700
Right?

2181
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,500
I don't care.

2182
02:07:56,100 --> 02:08:00,100
So what I could do is I could say that a be a inverse if all I'm

2183
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:02,100
talking about is 2D rotations, well, that doesn't matter.

2184
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,600
It's just the same as a inverse B which is the same as B and you're

2185
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:06,100
right.

2186
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:10,700
The problem is that doesn't happen in 3D in 3D rotations, do not

2187
02:08:10,700 --> 02:08:11,900
commute right?

2188
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,400
Because they are non-euclidean that way.

2189
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:16,600
They don't, they do not obey.

2190
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:21,300
Any sort of rearrangement.

2191
02:08:21,300 --> 02:08:26,000
You can't start swapping the terms and expect the 3D rotations to come

2192
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,100
out being the same.

2193
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:31,300
And furthermore this would not necessarily work if these matrices

2194
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:32,600
represented something else.

2195
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:35,600
So you know if they weren't rotations, if they were some other thing

2196
02:08:36,100 --> 02:08:39,200
maybe even in 2D we could construct something that wouldn't work

2197
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:42,400
because the matrices you know wouldn't work properly, they don't

2198
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:42,900
commute.

2199
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:46,000
Let's say because matron application in general is not commutative it

2200
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,900
just happens to be in the

2201
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:48,300
Matuidi rotation.

2202
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:50,400
so,

2203
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:57,600
normally, there are actually two different things that would happen

2204
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,800
here one would be if

2205
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:00,800
Fly be.

2206
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:03,800
And it would be a certain rotation and another one would be if you

2207
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,600
applied a be a inverse, right?

2208
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:12,800
And they're not actually the same, this one applies be as if we were

2209
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:13,900
in a is frame.

2210
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:19,100
The other one applies be as it exists in the world normally, right?

2211
02:09:19,700 --> 02:09:25,100
And so another way of saying that what would be it applies be as if

2212
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:29,700
the world had already shifted so that a was where it was right?

2213
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,800
But it doesn't apply it in a space.

2214
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,200
We still end up with a world space result.

2215
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:36,900
And that's why, right?

2216
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:40,900
Because we were talking before about like a inverse b or some like

2217
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:42,500
parental parent to transform.

2218
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,500
Those are ones that Cascade and take something from the child from be

2219
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:48,200
space, right?

2220
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:51,300
If we had be in here or something like that, where we're trying to

2221
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:53,500
take something from be space, all the way out to World, space will be

2222
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:56,200
2 multiplied by b and a and whatever and they're parented.

2223
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:57,000
That's one thing.

2224
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,200
But in this case, we're talking about everything is in World space

2225
02:09:59,400 --> 02:09:59,800
alien world.

2226
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,700
Bees and wasps the point in World space.

2227
02:10:01,900 --> 02:10:04,100
And now I just want to know what's the transform.

2228
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:06,800
That applies be as if it were in a space.

2229
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,100
Without actually ever putting it there, right?

2230
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:13,900
If that makes sense.

2231
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:17,300
So let me keep going.

2232
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,000
Hopefully some of this is helping at all.

2233
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,600
Maybe it's all complete hogwash.

2234
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:24,700
I don't know, but like I said, it's been so long since I've worked on

2235
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,000
this stuff.

2236
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,200
It's a shock, I'm remembering any of this.

2237
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,500
So my explanations are probably not as Lucid as they would be if that

2238
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,100
wasn't the case.

2239
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:34,300
But so continuing on

2240
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,700
Think about this algebraically, right?

2241
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:42,800
So let's say I have P Prime equals B P.

2242
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:47,400
Okay, this is saying all right eye, and I'm going to use that notation

2243
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:47,600
again.

2244
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:50,600
I apologize again if it's confusing but let's say B is in c space &

2245
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:53,100
and P is in be space, right?

2246
02:10:53,200 --> 02:10:58,300
So this is essentially the case where I have a point in coded and this

2247
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,400
you know, we could think of this as like a bones its kind of the

2248
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,900
system or something like that, right?

2249
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:04,700
Where let's say, I've got a mechanical arm kind of a thing here.

2250
02:11:04,900 --> 02:11:05,400
Right.

2251
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:09,300
And here is my transform for be, okay?

2252
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:12,200
And I'm representing it in this in this outer space.

2253
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:17,300
See and hear is this is a point that's encoded off of B that's p and I

2254
02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:20,300
want to know in see space what this is, right?

2255
02:11:20,300 --> 02:11:24,000
So I'm going to multiply p and b space times b and c space and I get P

2256
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
the world P.

2257
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:29,400
Okay, now I want to have this be a to link thing.

2258
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,100
So I'm going to consider this right?

2259
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:34,700
Which is the a transform and B is going to be an ace.

2260
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:35,300
Space.

2261
02:11:35,300 --> 02:11:36,900
So we're not dealing with that anymore.

2262
02:11:37,500 --> 02:11:40,400
Instead, we're going to deal with a child parent child situation.

2263
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:43,800
Now, we all know how to get that, right if I want PNC space again.

2264
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:46,200
Well, now I've got to concatenate all the transforms a whole way

2265
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:46,700
around.

2266
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:48,400
Right, I've had a and see his face.

2267
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:49,500
I have be in a space.

2268
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:53,000
I have p in Indy space, right?

2269
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:57,000
These cancels a cancels I end up with p and c space and that's how I

2270
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,600
transform it out, right?

2271
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,300
You've got you've seen that before.

2272
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:04,400
Yeah, you've seen it like a bunch of times, right?

2273
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:08,600
Now, what would happen?

2274
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:18,800
However, if I wanted to do this transform the same, like I want to do

2275
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:20,100
trying to think of how to

2276
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:22,500
How to explain this in a way.

2277
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:23,400
That makes more sense.

2278
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:23,900
Okay.

2279
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:28,300
So now let's say, I want to do the same transform exact same transform

2280
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:31,300
but I want to encode pee in a different space, right?

2281
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,100
I want to encode pee in.

2282
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,900
I want to encode p as if it were in.

2283
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:56,600
Sorry, bear with me for a moment.

2284
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:59,700
I'm trying to think of what the best way to explain this is I'll start

2285
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:00,300
with this.

2286
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,100
So let's suppose that I was going to move P to a different space,

2287
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:05,800
right?

2288
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:07,700
I'm just going to move P to a different space entirely.

2289
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Well, it's free for me to take this equation and insert any pair of a

2290
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:13,300
matrix.

2291
02:13:13,300 --> 02:13:15,600
And it's inverse because the Matrix times its inverse is the identity

2292
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:16,000
Matrix.

2293
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:17,600
So we always can do

2294
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,300
This right if I want to.

2295
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:25,900
So I can insert the identity Matrix here into this equation

2296
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,100
algebraically.

2297
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:29,400
It doesn't change the meaning of it, right?

2298
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,100
I get insert 50 of them, it wouldn't change me because at any Matrix

2299
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:33,300
doesn't do anything, that's the point of it.

2300
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:34,500
That's why it's called a data matrix.

2301
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:35,600
It's the multiplicative identity.

2302
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:38,100
Just to be clear, not the additive identity, which would be all zeros.

2303
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:42,700
So little think of identity Matrix, I diagonal 1s down the diagonal,

2304
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:43,900
Right.

2305
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:45,800
So

2306
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:53,500
If I replace this identity Matrix with this combination AC a or

2307
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:55,900
actually I'll do the opposite one because it'll be easier for me

2308
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,800
inverse AC p--.

2309
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:05,300
Be right then, now you can sort of see one place where I might

2310
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:09,400
naturally get the similarity transform to occur, right?

2311
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:16,600
Which is if I wanted to apply the composite transform of A and B,

2312
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:17,100
right?

2313
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:17,500
It.

2314
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:24,300
But I have my points in the space.

2315
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:28,100
That's been transformed by a already, right?

2316
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:32,500
So let's say, I want to store all of my P points.

2317
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,300
I want to store them pre transfer and buy a for some reason, right?

2318
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:42,400
But I want to know when I store my other matrices, I want to know what

2319
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:43,200
the transform is.

2320
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,800
That would give me back what I was doing before, right?

2321
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:52,400
That's one place where this tends to happen and so, you can imagine

2322
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:56,000
something where you have, you know, like, I've got pee and I've got a

2323
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:57,700
BP.

2324
02:14:59,400 --> 02:14:59,800
Right.

2325
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,000
It often times, you'll get it a situation where you go like, okay, you

2326
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,400
know, let me go ahead and add in that identity here.

2327
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:12,000
Write a inverse a p, right?

2328
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,500
And now I can press this down to like similarity transform.

2329
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:18,400
Transformed point, right?

2330
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:20,900
So here's my similarity transform.

2331
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:22,400
Here's my new point.

2332
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,300
Whatever you want to call it.

2333
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,500
And I keep this and I keep this right?

2334
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:32,800
And later I can reproduce P Prime but with a different a space, if

2335
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:33,500
that makes sense.

2336
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:37,400
Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, I don't know.

2337
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:42,900
To give a concrete example of that happening algebraically.

2338
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:51,600
Let's talk about space change.

2339
02:15:51,600 --> 02:15:51,900
Okay.

2340
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:52,200
Okay.

2341
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:52,800
Okay, okay.

2342
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:54,000
Yes.

2343
02:15:55,600 --> 02:15:59,200
This might make some sense to, I don't know if any of that made sense

2344
02:15:59,200 --> 02:15:59,800
to you at all.

2345
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:02,700
Hopefully did like I said I'm sorry it's just it's all really buried

2346
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:06,300
back in the brain so I don't remember like good ways to communicate it

2347
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:07,300
as well as I should.

2348
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:11,000
So one more time coming after different angle, see if this helps at

2349
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:11,300
all.

2350
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:19,800
Let's suppose that I have that bone chain and now I want to transform

2351
02:16:19,800 --> 02:16:22,600
the bone chain, right?

2352
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,200
So so

2353
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:31,000
Artist creates a thing in Maya, right?

2354
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:32,900
And the thing looks like this.

2355
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:36,299
Okay, here's the route.

2356
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,900
A here's B.

2357
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:39,799
Here's C.

2358
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:41,700
And here's the point.

2359
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,000
Okay?

2360
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:49,799
So we know that this is and this is some animated thing, right?

2361
02:16:49,799 --> 02:16:52,299
So, this is a dude's arm or something, right?

2362
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:54,299
Here's like the center point.

2363
02:16:54,299 --> 02:16:55,200
Here's the shoulder.

2364
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,200
Here's the elbow.

2365
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:58,200
And here's the hand, right?

2366
02:16:59,299 --> 02:17:02,000
So, this is a bone system, and I've got an animation.

2367
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,400
So I've got animations and all the stuff I've got.

2368
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:07,000
Each of these is like an animation, right?

2369
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:10,100
Track that I've got, and I've got points.

2370
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:11,799
Which Define the skeleton, right?

2371
02:17:11,799 --> 02:17:13,299
So they're around here, whatever.

2372
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:14,299
Okay.

2373
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,400
So I know that in the tool in the art tool, my equation was always

2374
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,000
this, right?

2375
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:28,700
It was take a point multiplied by C then B then a and then I get my my

2376
02:17:28,700 --> 02:17:30,799
transform point out, right?

2377
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:33,600
And I'm like, that's how I was doing everything.

2378
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:37,700
It's all good and I know that I can just work with it and it's fine.

2379
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:41,900
But let's say these have scale and shear and position and everything

2380
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:45,000
else in them, so they're completely generic transforms, right?

2381
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:46,100
Not just rotations.

2382
02:17:46,799 --> 02:17:48,500
So there everything goes in here, too,

2383
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:50,299
All right.

2384
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:51,200
Now,

2385
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:53,799
We say hi.

2386
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:59,400
Well, all of these models remodeled a bit wrong, right?

2387
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,600
Actually didn't want them modeled with Zeke.

2388
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:08,000
Going up, we wanted the model with Y going up but Maya had Z going up

2389
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:12,299
and with their also modeled like 45 degrees twisted or something,

2390
02:18:12,299 --> 02:18:12,799
right?

2391
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:18,299
So we've actually got this other Matrix M that we want to apply to the

2392
02:18:18,299 --> 02:18:19,500
mesh, right?

2393
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,600
To all the points.

2394
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:29,799
To sort of move them to the right locations, right?

2395
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:33,400
That's what we wanted to do, and

2396
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:41,000
you know, I should also mention

2397
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,100
Well, I'll leave this out for now.

2398
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:49,900
So what I effectively want to do here, right?

2399
02:18:50,299 --> 02:18:54,600
Is I want to be able to store.

2400
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:58,100
I don't want to do this at runtime meaning, I don't want to have to do

2401
02:18:58,100 --> 02:19:00,299
extra Matrix multiplications at runtime.

2402
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:03,299
So the trivial way to make this happen, right?

2403
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:04,799
Would I just be like, oh, okay?

2404
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:08,000
Well, you know, if I want to make all of this thing's transformed by

2405
02:19:08,299 --> 02:19:10,100
m, i just sticking them on the end.

2406
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:12,100
I'll just transform everything by n.

2407
02:19:12,299 --> 02:19:13,100
Em, Right?

2408
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:15,400
And I'll be done.

2409
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:20,000
But if I was to do that right?

2410
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:26,400
I would have to actually do that extra matrix multiplication, right?

2411
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:32,500
There's no real way for me to get around that in any particular way.

2412
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:36,100
Is that true?

2413
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:40,600
Well, I guess I'm trying to construct the scheme where I have to

2414
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:42,200
totally have to use this.

2415
02:19:43,900 --> 02:19:46,100
Because I suppose you could just bake it into this track.

2416
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:49,700
If you wanted to write, you could, you could bake that transform in

2417
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:50,600
here, which

2418
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,100
Still kind of works.

2419
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:08,800
I guess you'll have to just assume that for some reason you want to do

2420
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:14,000
this, you want to store the peas, pre transformed by m and you want to

2421
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,500
store these pre transfer by m.

2422
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:18,700
So it really all isn't that space and by the way, we did this in

2423
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:21,900
granny because people on the export path, want to be able to do this,

2424
02:20:21,900 --> 02:20:22,400
right?

2425
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:25,500
They want to be able to bake their assets into whatever, coordinate

2426
02:20:25,500 --> 02:20:26,200
space they want.

2427
02:20:26,200 --> 02:20:29,100
They don't want to have to transform it at runtime, right?

2428
02:20:29,300 --> 02:20:30,400
So it is a real case.

2429
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:32,700
I'm just trying to motivate why you would necessarily want to do this.

2430
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:33,000
And

2431
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:34,600
Simplicity is one.

2432
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:37,000
There's probably other real reasons you want to do it too.

2433
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:39,000
But so what I want to do, right?

2434
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,600
As I want to transform the peas by m and I want to transform all the

2435
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:46,500
matrices by m, but obviously I can't just stick an m on the beginning

2436
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:48,800
because that would just transform all the Mas.

2437
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:51,500
The peas would not actually be changed in the way that they should be

2438
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:51,600
in.

2439
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,100
None of these would be change the way that they should be either.

2440
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:57,200
And so you kind of end up in the situation where you're like, huh?

2441
02:20:59,000 --> 02:20:59,500
Right.

2442
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:09,500
So if I actually want to do this, they're right what I want now is I

2443
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:11,200
want to have my mu.

2444
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:12,500
No, this is what I want.

2445
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:13,500
So I do want this.

2446
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:16,000
So if I multiplied both sides by MP,

2447
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,100
I get the right equation.

2448
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:22,000
This does produce the results.

2449
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,600
I just can't store it still as three.

2450
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:30,400
I can't store it as three matrices and the point because it's got its

2451
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,300
got this extra transform in there, right?

2452
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:35,300
So the question is, what can I do to get around that?

2453
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:37,000
Well, let's use that trick.

2454
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:41,500
I said about, inserting the identity again, right everywhere.

2455
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:43,600
Okay.

2456
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:50,800
Well, if I insert the identity in between each of my terms, then I can

2457
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:56,300
expand that identity out if I want to to M inverse M, right.

2458
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:02,700
So everywhere I had an eye right here it can come back here at become

2459
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:04,100
that there's my see.

2460
02:22:04,100 --> 02:22:05,300
And hear it can come that again.

2461
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:08,200
So everywhere I have an m.

2462
02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:12,900
I mean I I can expand it to an M inverse M, right?

2463
02:22:13,900 --> 02:22:15,000
Well now look what I got.

2464
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:22,800
Well similarity, transform day becomes the new a similarity transform

2465
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,100
be becomes.

2466
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:25,600
The new be simply layer.

2467
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:26,900
Transform similarity.

2468
02:22:26,900 --> 02:22:32,300
Transform C becomes the new C and the transfer and point becomes the

2469
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:34,300
new input point, right?

2470
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:37,300
This I don't know what I'm going to call this new.

2471
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:39,800
Really want to be in.

2472
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:43,400
Give me some other name for it.

2473
02:22:43,800 --> 02:22:44,500
This is

2474
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:46,500
a new.

2475
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:47,400
I don't know why.

2476
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:49,500
Be new.

2477
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:51,400
Seenu.

2478
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:53,700
And Pinot.

2479
02:22:55,700 --> 02:22:58,100
All right, oh, and I guess I could call them the Emma fide.

2480
02:22:58,200 --> 02:22:59,100
Call them F IDE.

2481
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:02,700
All right.

2482
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:04,800
Algebraically.

2483
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,900
Hopefully, that makes reasonable sense to you because nothing weird

2484
02:23:06,900 --> 02:23:07,700
happened there, right?

2485
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,600
All I did was say, I'm going to multiply this equation on both sides

2486
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:10,900
by m.

2487
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:15,000
So I'm just transforming the, the, the space by m, that's it.

2488
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,900
I just moved the points by em.

2489
02:23:16,900 --> 02:23:18,500
That's all I did, right?

2490
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:19,900
So, geometrically, right.

2491
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:21,000
Whatever we had.

2492
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,100
I don't know what it was, right.

2493
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:25,900
Here's that P.

2494
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:27,600
Whatever we did.

2495
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,700
We just moved it by m.

2496
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:31,900
If m is some weird rotation, we just moved the point, right?

2497
02:23:31,900 --> 02:23:32,700
That's all we did.

2498
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:36,300
And then we said well, all right, insert the identities.

2499
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:36,800
Expand.

2500
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,100
Those M inverse M.

2501
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:39,900
You can see the similarity transform happened here.

2502
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:40,600
Here here.

2503
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:47,200
And here, I'm sorry here here and here and you're left with the M on

2504
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,000
the P, right?

2505
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:50,400
So what's that doing intuitively?

2506
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:55,200
Well, like I said the similarity transform applies a as if it's in Ms,

2507
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:55,700
space.

2508
02:23:55,700 --> 02:23:58,500
So you can see what this equation actually does.

2509
02:23:58,500 --> 02:23:59,900
It says I want to store

2510
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,700
P in m space with the m modification, right?

2511
02:24:03,700 --> 02:24:05,200
That's what I actually wanted to do.

2512
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,200
And in order to do that, I need each of these people to be as if they

2513
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,400
were in m-space, right?

2514
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:18,900
And so that is essentially what is going on there.

2515
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:19,900
It's similarity.

2516
02:24:19,900 --> 02:24:23,200
Transforms is doing that interpretation for you, so you can store

2517
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:28,000
those with this point, pre transform, but still get the same result

2518
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:29,000
right?

2519
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:32,200
Still end up with MP Prime at the end.

2520
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,000
So in grainy, this is what would happen.

2521
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,600
If you ask for a coordinate system change, right?

2522
02:24:37,700 --> 02:24:40,600
It would take all your animation tracks and apply the similarity,

2523
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:44,300
transform to them, take your mesh and apply the transform to the mesh,

2524
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,900
and then you're done.

2525
02:24:49,700 --> 02:24:50,300
So, there you go.

2526
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,700
Alright, so there you go.

2527
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,100
Hopefully that answered the question.

2528
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:05,600
So I guess I'll now ask Clemens found any of that.

2529
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:06,500
Help at all?

2530
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:08,000
Or is it completely useless?

2531
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:45,400
Clemens, bam.

2532
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:45,800
Thank you.

2533
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:46,200
Very insightful.

2534
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:48,800
Observation, can you recommend a book where I can learn more about

2535
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,800
these kinds of things?

2536
02:25:49,800 --> 02:25:51,100
How did you learn it all in?

2537
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:52,000
Such an intuitive way.

2538
02:25:55,800 --> 02:25:57,300
I mean, the answer is how I learned it.

2539
02:25:57,300 --> 02:25:58,500
All in an intuitive way.

2540
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:02,400
Is I worked on character animation code for five years, right?

2541
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:05,200
And character animation code is the place where this stuff gets

2542
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,300
drilled into you quick because anything, that you do wrong will come

2543
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:09,200
back to haunt you.

2544
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:13,000
So, and licensable character animation at that.

2545
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,700
So it was being used by hundreds of Studios.

2546
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:19,600
So, every little problem that could crop up cropped up, and you have

2547
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:21,300
to be able to work through it.

2548
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:24,000
What I used for sources of the time.

2549
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:24,500
I don't know.

2550
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:27,000
I mean, I learned linear algebra out of Gilbert Strang.

2551
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:28,700
People have said that's not a very good book.

2552
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:30,000
So there's probably better books out there.

2553
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,700
I don't know, I don't really remember him covering the similarity

2554
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:34,100
transform, but he probably did.

2555
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:34,800
I don't know that.

2556
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:35,800
I learned it from him, though.

2557
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:37,100
I don't think I did.

2558
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:45,000
I don't really know where I learned that I really don't.

2559
02:26:51,900 --> 02:26:54,400
Yeah, sorry I really don't know where it's good places.

2560
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:58,700
Just working with matrices, a lot and thinking about transforms a lot

2561
02:26:58,800 --> 02:26:59,700
helps with

2562
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:00,400
Koreans.

2563
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:02,000
I did a lot of the early work.

2564
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:04,700
There was nobody had ever worked out any of that stuff.

2565
02:27:04,700 --> 02:27:06,100
At least not in our industry.

2566
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:09,000
So, I was used to having to figure this stuff out on my own.

2567
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,500
Like the quaternion multi-way linear blend was a bunch of stuff that I

2568
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:15,800
had to do on my own, the, the quaternion double cover stuff for

2569
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:16,600
character animation.

2570
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:17,500
I did that on my own.

2571
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:21,100
So I was very used to having to work these things out myself.

2572
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:23,700
and,

2573
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:29,000
And so some of these things were things that I probably saw in a book.

2574
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,200
This one, I feel like I've seen this covered.

2575
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:36,400
This exact thing, I think.

2576
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,700
But I'll be honest, I really can't remember.

2577
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:49,300
I don't know if I had to work that one out on my own or not, I

2578
02:27:49,300 --> 02:27:51,100
guarantee you this is covered somewhere.

2579
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:53,500
I just don't know whether I read it or whether I had to work it out on

2580
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:54,000
my own.

2581
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:02,700
I don't know.

2582
02:28:04,300 --> 02:28:06,500
And sometimes it's something you work out on a Blackboard with someone

2583
02:28:06,500 --> 02:28:09,000
else to, you know, like maybe I was talking to somebody and we worked

2584
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:09,400
it out you know.

2585
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:12,400
So it could have been something that I collaborated with on someone

2586
02:28:12,500 --> 02:28:13,200
something like that.

2587
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:17,200
It's not really a big, aha moment necessarily so it's not like it was

2588
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:17,500
something.

2589
02:28:17,500 --> 02:28:21,700
I would have remembered exactly how I came about how it came about.

2590
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:25,100
But yeah.

2591
02:28:27,900 --> 02:28:32,700
I would say the number one thing to Beyond books like books are okay

2592
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:35,800
for math but a lot of books are bad at math like they don't explain

2593
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:36,000
math.

2594
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:36,500
Well

2595
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:41,700
So I would say the number one thing to do if you really want to learn

2596
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:43,000
this stuff and be really good at it.

2597
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:47,100
Actually, the thing to do is write a program that renders it all.

2598
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:52,500
So like I had this program, I wrote called math Vis and it was just a

2599
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:55,200
little thing that Drew like grids and arrows and stuff.

2600
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:58,700
And I used to do all my experiments in that and so I could draw

2601
02:28:58,700 --> 02:28:59,200
everything.

2602
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:01,500
So, I'd like, draw all the frames of reference, like, I could draw all

2603
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:04,800
these, I could draw the results of transforms and see, and it really

2604
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:08,000
builds up your geometric intuition when you can see everything.

2605
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,100
You know.

2606
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:13,000
so,

2607
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,100
you know, that's something to think about James Woodman.

2608
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:24,400
Would any of this have been mentioned in the comments in the grainy

2609
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:26,900
source code, or is it considered obvious to people work in the context

2610
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:30,000
of this probably is pretty obvious, but like, in the grainy source

2611
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,100
code, for example, there's a what there's a thing, the sparse, the

2612
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:42,700
sparse B spline curve, fitting solver, which was a pretty crazy thing.

2613
02:29:42,700 --> 02:29:46,200
And it's day nowadays, I'd probably do it a lot differently, but at

2614
02:29:46,200 --> 02:29:47,600
the time it was kind of crazy.

2615
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:55,400
That thing is absurd and there is like, you know, five pages of

2616
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:57,200
comments at the top of it explaining how it works.

2617
02:29:57,900 --> 02:29:59,900
So some things in there are documented

2618
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,600
Heavily because I'm like, this is very, very confusing what this does,

2619
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:05,400
right?

2620
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:06,700
So,

2621
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
So this, I don't know, I mean, if you're working on character

2622
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:12,100
animation, you probably.

2623
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:12,800
But I mean,

2624
02:30:13,900 --> 02:30:16,700
You should probably know this by now so I don't know that I would have

2625
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:20,400
commented this in any particular way I might have put a comment that's

2626
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:24,200
like similarity, transform the thing or whatever, right?

2627
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:29,300
And if you don't know what that is, probably you shouldn't be working

2628
02:30:29,300 --> 02:30:29,800
on granny.

2629
02:30:29,800 --> 02:30:30,100
I don't know.

2630
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:31,400
I mean, I don't know like

2631
02:30:32,500 --> 02:30:34,900
If you don't know what a similar transformation, it's probably not.

2632
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:37,100
You probably shouldn't be working on like some character animation.

2633
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:40,400
But who knows, you know, maybe you could now because hey, it's already

2634
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:40,900
built for you.

2635
02:30:40,900 --> 02:30:43,600
So just but now you're gonna get bugs and you gotta work through them.

2636
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:46,000
So you'd have to know, I mean, you'd have to know that.

2637
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:49,600
I would think.

2638
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:53,200
All right, I'm going to, I'm going to wrap it up.

2639
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:08,400
Oh, no, Milton.

2640
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:13,000
I don't think I've ever seen Milton Clash before I must have done

2641
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,200
something to make it Angry.

2642
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:16,800
Let's see if it saved our work better.

2643
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:19,500
This will be interesting test of Milton because I haven't ever hit the

2644
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,200
save button.

2645
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:25,700
Supposedly Milton just works and you don't ever have to tell it to

2646
02:31:25,700 --> 02:31:26,200
save.

2647
02:31:30,200 --> 02:31:31,200
Let's see if that's true.

2648
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:34,500
Wow.

2649
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,800
That's pretty cool man.

2650
02:31:37,900 --> 02:31:38,800
You got to admit.

2651
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:40,100
That's pretty cool.

2652
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:44,200
Can you undo after you reload?

2653
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:46,400
Holy cow.

2654
02:31:47,900 --> 02:31:50,200
Okay, you got to admit.

2655
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,600
That is pretty cool.

2656
02:31:54,100 --> 02:31:54,800
Right.

2657
02:31:56,200 --> 02:32:00,000
You just never have hit the save button and if the thing crashes even

2658
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,700
you just reload it, it's there and the undo is even there.

2659
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:05,700
That is so the way software should work.

2660
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:07,400
That's awesome.

2661
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:10,900
Sergey that is very well done.

2662
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:14,200
Very, very well done.

2663
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:17,200
I said his name wrong.

2664
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:23,700
Again, it's Sergio with a, it's only Sergei on the stream, right?

2665
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:27,700
It's like Serge x, y, z or something but it's actually Sergio in real

2666
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:30,600
life and it's the one that I couldn't pronounce sexually in Spanish,

2667
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:33,000
as like Sergio, but

2668
02:32:39,500 --> 02:32:41,300
All right, so I'm going to close it down.

2669
02:32:42,500 --> 02:32:43,700
That's pretty awesome Milton.

2670
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:44,200
Well done.

2671
02:32:44,700 --> 02:32:45,600
Well done, sir.

2672
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:52,800
If only Photoshop worked like that, I'm sure artists that Molly rocket

2673
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:54,400
would be much happier if it did.

2674
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:57,800
Thank you for joining me for another, for the handmade hero.

2675
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

2676
02:32:59,000 --> 02:32:59,900
As always, if you would like

2677
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Follow along at home.

2678
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:03,600
You can always pre-order the game, it comes to the source code.

2679
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:07,700
We also have Forum site, you can go to if you want to ask questions,

2680
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:09,800
you have a patreon page who wants fourth video series, the schedule

2681
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:12,500
bot, that tells you when we're going to be live and then episode

2682
02:33:12,500 --> 02:33:14,100
guide, if you want to catch up on past episodes.

2683
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:15,200
So check those out.

2684
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:17,600
I'll be back here next week.

2685
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:19,400
Schedule, a next week might be a little weird.

2686
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,300
So definitely check the tweetbot for that head over here.

2687
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:26,700
If you want to know what it's gonna be live until then everyone have

2688
02:33:26,700 --> 02:33:28,600
fun programming and I will see you guys on the internet.

2689
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:29,500
Take it easy, everyone.
