1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,200
Alright.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,200
Welcome to handmade hero.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,500
The show where we code a complete game live on Twitch from scratch.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
No library's new engine, and

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,400
Today's kind of a good day.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,100
I think I'll have to see how it goes.

8
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,600
You know, you never can count your chickens before they hatch.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Sometimes they hatch into a little stillborn chicken fetuses and

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,300
that's no good for anybody.

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:29,200
But what I will say is, you know, like I like I said, when we started

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,800
this I was like one of the big things that we're doing here is we're

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,300
trying to put enough code down in sort of like a primitive form that

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,600
we can tell how everything should be structured.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,500
So that when we go

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,400
And we start writing individual pieces that are meant to be shippable

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,000
quality.

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,300
We don't fall into the standard trap of over-designing under designing

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,300
designing the wrong thing, doing all the sorts of things that happen

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,400
when you don't write the usage code first, right?

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I've said that many times always write the usage code first and it's

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
very important.

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,000
So that's what we've been doing and the entire time that we've been

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,600
doing it.

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,100
I've been looking at some more advanced features in the entity stuff,

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
the low and high frequency set thing and be able to scale to large

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
numbers of entities and that sort of stuff.

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,800
And that's something we wanted to do but it was never quite clear.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,900
Exactly how we could architect the code to make that work.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,800
Nice and cleanly.

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,700
But that was okay for me.

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,100
Because like I said, the important thing is to get enough code down

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,000
that you can see and slowly over time, good solutions to how you want

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,200
to do.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,000
Things architectural e kind of work their way up from the code that

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,800
you have down there and

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,300
It's really just a matter of sticking it through and, and trying doing

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,300
enough sort of trying of things that you want to have to accomplish to

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,800
get to the point where you can actually do it.

40
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,000
And so, while after the stream last night, I was lying in bed and

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,500
normally I don't I'm not super good at falling asleep.

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,100
So typically, what happens as I like go to bed and then I'll just get

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,200
up like 30 minutes later because it's pretty clear that I'm not going

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,400
to fall asleep and then I'll do some stuff for a while, and then I'll

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,500
go back and try to fall asleep again later.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,700
So, I was lying in bed.

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,500
And what I realized is, I finally realized.

48
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,500
I think the crucial thing that with the high and low frequency stuff

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,300
that can make it into a nice clean architecture.

50
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,200
And so, I want to talk a little bit about that.

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,900
because I was pretty psyched that's like yes, this is the thing that

52
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,100
I've been waiting to sort of

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,300
See click in a good way.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,300
So what I realized is, and what day are we here on handmade here?

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,500
We're day 63.

56
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,800
So what I realized here on day 63, right, well, I guess this was a 62

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,300
when I realized it but I realized we have two constraints that are

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,100
coming together, right?

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,400
We have two constraints, the constraints are number one, we want a

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,200
Extremely large world, right?

61
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,800
So we want to be able to handle worlds that are

62
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,300
Large that floating Point accuracy would immediately degrade if you

63
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,100
were to try to store them all as single floats, right?

64
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,400
So we wanted to say that our engine could support that again.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,500
Not because any into particular engine has to support that, but

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,400
rather, because we want to show how you handle it in code because it

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
is something that does come up.

68
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,200
If you want to do large worlds and you want to do them, right?

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
So I wanted to put that in there.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,300
We had another thing which is extremely large, entity counts, right?

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,100
So we basically have two scalability things we want to talk about one

72
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
is about float Precision, right?

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,200
And one is about basically about processing power, if you will.

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Right, this is about processing power.

75
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,800
The problem with extremely large worlds, is that we will run out of

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,500
precision in a 32-bit float, to deal with them if we just did

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,800
everything in float and pretend said, whatever anything goes, the

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,400
problem with extremely large entity counts is that we don't have

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,500
enough processing power to, basically do to just write code where we

80
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,600
write the code for every entity.

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,800
And then, just run all the entities in the world all the time that

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
will never scale to very large, enemy counts.

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,100
So we have two competing concerns here.

84
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,100
And what I realized is I was not thinking about them together.

85
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,500
I was not thinking about how they related to each other, I was

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,700
implicitly dealing with their intersection but I wasn't thinking about

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,100
it.

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,500
Overtly.

89
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,100
And so what I realized is that if you think about it, overtly I think

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,400
that shows the way to doing the good architecture that handles both of

91
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,400
these things, which is our goal in this design process, right?

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,700
So let's talk about that.

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,400
What does this float Precision thing?

94
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,000
Make us do if we don't want to just use doubles, if we don't want,

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
just go to 64-bit floating-point, which there's a number of reasons we

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,800
don't want to do.

97
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,700
Either half as fast, be there's platforms that don't support them at

98
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,500
all natively.

99
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,300
See we don't actually necessarily even need that much Precision blah

100
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:07,900
blah, blah, blah.

101
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,000
There's all sorts of reasons why it might not be a good idea to

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,500
strictly go to doubles, right?

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
But the real big

104
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Just a performance, right?

105
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,300
We know that we're going to be half as fast if we don't, if we did

106
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,500
that.

107
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,200
So we'd like to make sure that most of all of our stuff that's

108
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,800
happening, you know, all of the computations that we do for everything

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
we'd like to be able to do those at full speed, we'd like to be able

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,900
to do them in float, so that we can be fully for wide on 8 wide, or 16

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,500
wide, and 70.

112
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Instead of too wide for wider, 8 wide on Sunday, right?

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
So we get basically twice the performance of, for, in float.

114
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,100
So, we want to do is we want to be able to do, we want to be able to

115
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,700
To live in that world, right, want to be a live in that world, but

116
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,800
what that means is that whenever we do our calculations, if we're

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
doing everything in float, we have to be doing it around some origin

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,500
Point.

119
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
That's local, right?

120
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,800
So, what that means is if we have people everywhere in the world,

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,400
right?

122
00:05:59,400 --> 00:05:59,800
And this is

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
You this is the giant world.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's say right, this is the giant world, if we're looking at the

125
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
giant world and we say that we have all these entities that are like

126
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
over here, right?

127
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,200
And we want to talk about how they work in order to process them.

128
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,000
All, what we do is we first pick a local origin

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,600
and what we were using was the camera for this in our current code,

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,100
right?

131
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,800
We would take the camera and we just figure out where everyone was

132
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,500
relative to the camera, right?

133
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,000
So if you imagine what happens, we've taking a little slice of the

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
world, right?

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,700
And we're saying, wherever the camera is, you know, we just say where

136
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,700
the entities are relative to that camera and then because we know

137
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,400
that's a very small neighborhood.

138
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,800
Right?

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
That's only, you know, a few metres across.

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
We're talking about like, a 50 meter by 50 meter square, right?

141
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,700
Whereas, this might be like hundreds of

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,500
Is there something?

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,900
You know, I don't remember what we calculated it, but, you know, this

144
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,900
is huge and this is Tiny, this is not a problem for float Precision,

145
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,200
we have plenty of precision here and we could do our calculations and

146
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,400
Float.

147
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,000
No problem.

148
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,700
Right?

149
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,500
So what this implies is that we're always doing these calculations

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,000
right in a local neighborhood.

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,600
Okay.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,400
And so that's what led us to the whole.

153
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,700
We had low frequency and we had high frequency entities, right?

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,600
And what we were doing there is we were saying we were storing

155
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,700
basically, like an extended detail version of where the entity was

156
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,200
that involved tile positions, right?

157
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,500
Like a tile, chunk position and at offset, right?

158
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,100
So we were basically storing and and alternatively like again, if we

159
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,700
were on machines, that support doubles, we could store doubles here,

160
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,100
but basically, we had like the slow version of where people were were

161
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,900
in this low entity, right?

162
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
But the High version of where they were,

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,100
Just in a vector to write.

164
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,800
It was a vector to float.

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,600
So basically this gets translated to this and we would do our

166
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,300
calculations here but then we kept having we I mean, I don't even want

167
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,600
to say problems necessarily, but you could tell even just from an

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,000
early standpoint that there were just a lot of fussing involved in us

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,800
having to think about which state we were talking about the, whether

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,300
it was this position or that position and keeping these two things in

171
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
sync and all this other nonsense.

172
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,000
And it was really just a drag on the

173
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,300
The coating, right?

174
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,100
So so there's that but there's another problem and there's a problem

175
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,600
that we hadn't actually gotten to yet but that we sort of were setting

176
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,400
up to deal with which is the scaling to extremely large, entity counts

177
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
and basically what that was was saying.

178
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,600
Okay, so there's low frequency entities and high frequency entities,

179
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,100
right?

180
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,299
The all of the entities are always exist in the loaf.

181
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,700
Frequency set essentially their the data that actually describes the

182
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,300
entity and then there's this high frequency version of The Entity that

183
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:45,900
we actually use for.

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,900
It has some additional stuff in it, right?

185
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,400
And that's how we were handling this and when I said was well we're

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,000
going to want to be able to do processing on these low entities

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,500
because we want things in the world to keep happening, even when

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
you're not around it, so we want to be able to sort of have

189
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,200
People who are maybe like the example I gave was, you know let's say

190
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,800
there's like a creature or a guy who's like, go to go somewhere take

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
something from a location and bring it back, you know, I don't know to

192
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
his lair or something.

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,500
Who knows there's something going on out here and we want that to kind

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,700
of keep going on it, because it might be nice.

195
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,300
Give the world a nice emergent.

196
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,900
Feel when the player comes upon this and sees that, like, all of the

197
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,100
apples are missing from here, and they go to this little apple thief

198
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,200
and he's got all these apples in his back room or, I don't know

199
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
picking stupid things, but you know what I mean?

200
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,900
You want to be

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Able to see that sort of thing happen.

202
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,200
And furthermore, if you came right here and watch, you would see this

203
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,900
guy, come back carrying an apple and all that sort of stuff, right?

204
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,700
We want to support those kinds of things because again, hard to

205
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,700
program Ergo, we want to show it on the stream because the whole point

206
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,200
here is to learn how to do Advanced programming techniques.

207
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,200
So what I said was, well, we'll have the low frequency set, and then

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,800
what we'll do is, we'll just operate on this low frequency set at a

209
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
lower rate.

210
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
And then the high frequency set will be where all the magic happens.

211
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,500
So things that are clothes that are in the camera view, get the

212
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,000
high-frequency detail and so on so forth, right?

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,300
But in the back of my head, I was really worried about this because

214
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm like, well now we have to write every entities code twice, right?

215
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,900
We have to write like code that works for when they're high frequency

216
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
entities and code that works for the low phrase.

217
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,600
Like that doesn't sound very good.

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
I don't really know what to do about that.

219
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,000
You know, just it seems like there's going to be a lot of work there

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
and it just sounded bad, right?

221
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
So that was worrying me as well.

222
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,300
So all of this stuff was kind of built up.

223
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
So, what I realized when I started with sort of not even really

224
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,500
thinking about it or just kind of like must have been a background

225
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,600
process in the brain.

226
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Was I realized that that was exactly the wrong way to think about the

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,900
low-frequency entities, right thinking of range, based processing of

228
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,400
them.

229
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I was just playing dumb that was dumb.

230
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,100
There was really no reason to think about them in terms of index

231
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,700
ranges, right?

232
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,000
You remember?

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,900
I even set it on the stream.

234
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,600
I was like, let's go ahead and we'll just process like a thousand of

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
them at a time or something, right?

236
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,100
There's no that doesn't make any sense.

237
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,400
Why would you do that?

238
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,000
That is what would cause you to have to write things that operate

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,700
directly on the low entities instead of doing that.

240
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,000
Why not just basically have a second camera

241
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,200
I have a second camera that just moves around the world, simulating

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
the pieces of the world in chunks, right?

243
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,600
So that every frame you do to camera things basically, right?

244
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,100
You do the ones for where you can see, which should always be

245
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,000
simulated and then periodically at a lower frequency, you know, you

246
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,200
will basically sweep through all the other parts of the world,

247
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
focusing, the camera on them.

248
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
The virtual camera, in this case, map, all the things into the high

249
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,100
entity space, do the processing map them back to love.

250
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Low, right?

251
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,800
So basically what that means is now we can get rid of the concept of

252
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,100
Operating on a low entity at all right.

253
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,400
You will never touch a low entity.

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,000
There's never any reason to write.

255
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,500
It's strictly a storage format, which is what I kind of wanted when I

256
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:12,900
started.

257
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,000
But I just couldn't figure out how to do because of this dumb thing,

258
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,400
right?

259
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
It's like I would have rather had it so that, you know, I would rather

260
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,700
have always thought of low entities as just like a compressed or like

261
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,900
an archival format.

262
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,400
Right from my high ones, they just they map in here and they stick

263
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,800
sleep in this state.

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,300
Right.

265
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,000
And then they mapped back.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,800
That's how we would do it in a normal game, that wasn't trying to

267
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,400
simulate things anywhere, right?

268
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
That was there was doing something simpler than what we're trying to

269
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:37,700
do.

270
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,100
Here, we just compress the high entities or map, the high-end, he's

271
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,500
back into here you know, and some of its not compressive, sometimes

272
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,300
actually expansion like it's storing it in this more detailed format

273
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
for the position, for example.

274
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Right.

275
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,600
But in general you know I'm saying, we archive them to low and then we

276
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,400
bring them back from low into High when they come back on the screen,

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,900
that's what we would normally do.

278
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,900
And so the thing that was was causing me all the problems though was I

279
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,800
was like, we can't

280
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Do that because we want them to still be live.

281
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Well we can all we have to do is just always use Regional processing.

282
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,100
I don't know why I think of it before but that's just the way

283
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,800
programming work.

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,500
So it's the reason that I say to always do things by writing the code

285
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,200
first is because you need to give yourself the time to realize things,

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
they're always going to be obvious in hindsight.

287
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,500
But if you don't get the stuff out on the page, right?

288
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,500
Or in the editor, I should say.

289
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
And you don't have some time to look at how it's actually working.

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
In reality, you're never going to be

291
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,400
to have those insights because you just don't have the information you

292
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:32,900
need.

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And so this leads us to what I think is a very good way of structuring

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,200
this.

295
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,500
And we're going to start today.

296
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,700
I don't think we'll finish because we have some restructuring to do.

297
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,100
But basically what it's going to be is you never touch low entities,

298
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,900
solo enemies are narrow sir, there are storage format only

299
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,400
Right, so what happens is?

300
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,200
We have a New Concept basically.

301
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I don't know exact what we'll call this right, but will basically say

302
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
there's a simulation region, okay?

303
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
And again, this is exactly what I was talking about.

304
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,500
When I say engine architecture, you do it by seeing how things go and

305
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,600
then you pull up from there.

306
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,800
And that's exactly what we're doing.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
We're looking at what happened and we're going on.

308
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Ah, now I can finally see how things are supposed to work.

309
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Now, I can really see a true, a very important piece of my

310
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,200
architecture.

311
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,000
Come to fruition.

312
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,900
So what we'll do is we'll have a thing called a simulation region.

313
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,300
A simulation region is a rectangle in space just like we sort of had

314
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,800
already with the camera, right?

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,500
But it's completely self-contained in the code.

316
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,100
So it stores a high entity list for itself, right?

317
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,300
It stores its bounds and it's got a very well-defined beginning and

318
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,900
ending right in time in the code.

319
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,300
So we start it.

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,100
We map all of the entities in too high for that.

321
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,900
We run the processing and then we map them all back.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Too low, right?

323
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,300
So, basically, this is an entirely self-contained thing in the code.

324
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Simulation region, you can do them anywhere you want, and you can do

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,800
as many of them as you want.

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And they come and they go, right?

327
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,200
They never persist across a frame, boundary ever.

328
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Right.

329
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,600
And if we ever wanted them to persist across the frame boundary, that

330
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,700
would be an optimization.

331
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,800
So basically that would be something we'd add after the fact.

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,800
So that means now, we don't have to write two pieces of code, all the

333
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,700
pieces of code.

334
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
For simulation always happen.

335
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,500
Exactly the same way, right?

336
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:23,800
Always.

337
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Always exactly the same so that totally symbolizes our life quite a

338
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,200
bit and gives us one of our key Architectural Components assuming

339
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,900
again, that it works out when we go try it.

340
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,600
And so this is basically like this is a key component, right here.

341
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,100
That'll make sense.

342
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,700
Hopefully so again, not terribly different from what we've been doing.

343
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,000
It's very similar, but it organizes all of the pieces properly.

344
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,100
So that the problems that we were having with our current system,

345
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,900
don't happen anymore, right?

346
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,800
And basically no one ever looks like we have these problems with

347
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,900
moving entities, writing back to below and all this other stuff.

348
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,500
All of that is now totally gone because everything only happens on

349
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,900
high detail entities and only at the very end are things all written

350
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,800
back to low as a storage format only and I really like that because

351
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
that to me seems really, really pretty darn good.

352
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay.

353
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,600
Now there's one thing I want to mention which is is like sort of the

354
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
the slight wrinkle which has nothing to do with this.

355
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,900
Exactly we would have had it in the other system as well.

356
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,100
But something that's want to kind of point out because I think we got

357
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,800
a design in some, what's the word for it?

358
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,500
Affordances for it.

359
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,800
One thing that we didn't never actually deal dealt with and it I think

360
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,300
we can do deal with it pretty easily.

361
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,800
Now, is that in the past when we map things into our active region,

362
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,300
let's say this is the active region here.

363
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,600
This dotted line, then we have entities right in the world.

364
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Here are some entities in the world and here are some more enemies in

365
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,800
the world.

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,000
If we simulate all of the entities in this region, we have a problem

367
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,599
and that is that entities near the boundary may be allowed to move

368
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,800
outside of the boundary because on their time step they be able to

369
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,200
move across that boundary.

370
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,000
And in Crossing that boundary right?

371
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,599
They will not Collision detect with any things that were outside of

372
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,599
the boundary and entity that was right here or right here.

373
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,000
Would never have been brought into the high frequency set because it's

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,200
outside of that boundary.

375
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,700
So we need to be able to do is we need to be able to say okay

376
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,600
simulation actually happens inside a conservative boundary that is

377
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,600
less than the one frame movement distance away.

378
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,900
It's more than the one frame distance movement away from a secondary

380
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,700
boundary which is where everything gets pulled in.

381
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,600
So this outer boundary is basically the like the the, the high

382
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
boundary.

383
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,900
And this is like the Sim boundary.

384
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,900
So things in here, get Sims things in here, get pulled in, but not

385
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,100
So they're just standing there as colliders in case something tries to

386
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,300
go out there and hit one of them right.

387
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,900
But they themselves are not allowed to move.

388
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,800
Right?

389
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
At least not in this simulation pass.

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,700
Does that make sense?

391
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,400
They could still be active entities, and they still could be simulated

392
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,300
by something that went and did another simulation region that was

393
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,900
right here or something like this, right?

394
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,700
But what we want to do, is make sure that we essentially don't ever

395
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,400
have that case, where something could go outside of where it needs to

396
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,200
go, right?

397
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Where it's allowed to go.

398
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,700
So there's, there's nothing to think about.

399
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,400
Alright, so, I hope that all makes sense, I'm going to go ahead and

400
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,900
start the process of making that happen.

401
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,400
Like I said, that's going to take a little bit of reorganization,

402
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,800
which tends to be a little slow when we do it on the stream because I,

403
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,900
as I explain things, right, there's a lot of text moving around and

404
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,700
doing stuff that, that maybe makes things a little slower than it

405
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,000
would be.

406
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,800
If we were just going to reorganize it flat out.

407
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,500
But even so, I mean, even when you're just programming down in a

408
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,000
stream, it does take a while to do all the texts shuffling and stuff.

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,500
That's necessary.

410
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,600
Inside a reorganization, right?

411
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,500
So that's that's worth, that's worth noting.

412
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,300
It's never really that fast to do.

413
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,300
So it's gonna take a little time but I think it's definitely the right

414
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:14,800
thing to do.

415
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,100
So I'm going to go ahead and just flat-out.

416
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,300
Start that process, get us into position that does exactly what I just

417
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,700
said because we already have all the usage code written essentially

418
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,700
that should guide us and allow us to know that we have all the stuff

419
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,800
that we need to support it.

420
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,900
So

421
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,900
First things first, let's go ahead and say that we have handmade

422
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,800
simulation region.

423
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,900
I like that name.

424
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,000
It seems good enough to me and so we have a handmade simulation

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,500
region.

426
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,500
Well, I actually need to call it handmade.

427
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,700
Simulation recent, simulation region will be fine.

428
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,000
I guess I could call it the same region, but I don't know.

429
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,600
It's okay.

430
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,700
All right, all right, all right, we'll call up some will call.

431
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,200
It said, we'll call some reason.

432
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
No, need to introduce extra characters for no real reason.

433
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,700
So let's call it.

434
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,700
Made some region.

435
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,800
That's good enough.

436
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,000
All right, structs Tim region and assume region is going to what I'm

437
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,600
going to do bases in a move.

438
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,500
The stuff that used to be fast and loose and kind of always existing

439
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,200
in two places on a move that over in the simulation region.

440
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,500
So basically this over here is going to look like that, right?

441
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
And I'm going to call these just flat-out entities because

442
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,000
everything's going to work on these entities primarily, right?

443
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,900
So we're going to have an entity count and then we're going to have an

444
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,400
end of the array, right?

445
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
And that's going to be that's going to

446
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,300
Look like this.

447
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Now I'm going to get rid of this cap here, this entity cap, I'm going

448
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,600
to say that we just have a pointer and the pointer points to however

449
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,500
many is in this entity count structure, right?

450
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,200
And I might say that, we also have a Max entity count that can exist

451
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,400
here.

452
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
So, maybe there's some Headroom on this.

453
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,000
When we actually make it, I'm not sure that we even need that, but

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
we'll just leave that there for now.

455
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,400
Okay.

456
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,800
so,

457
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,000
That's our Sim region.

458
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
None of these other things are particularly relevant to the same

459
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,800
region, but now what we know is we kind of have this, we've got this

460
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
sort of set camera call and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

461
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,900
that this is going to get broken up now, right?

462
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,500
So, instead of a thing that goes through and looks, whether things

463
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,300
need to get mapped out of the high frequency space into a low

464
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,500
frequency space, this offset and check frequency by area thing, that's

465
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,600
now no longer on the table.

466
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,100
Right.

467
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,900
Everyone gets mapped in and out of the high frequency space every

468
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,300
frame.

469
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,300
That's just how we're going to do it.

470
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,200
And like I said, if it turns out that that's too slow, then what we'll

471
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,100
do is, we'll go ahead and will optimize it later as a separate thing

472
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,500
that we do.

473
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,600
But there's no sense in basically, premature optimizing that, at this

474
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,100
point.

475
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,800
So,

476
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,400
In our Sim reason.

477
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,400
What I want to do is take that offset and check frequency by area of

478
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,900
call.

479
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,300
Right offset and check tickets in by Eric Hall and take a look at

480
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,500
that.

481
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,800
And you can see that basically all that does was it was moving things.

482
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Packing things into low entities as they went.

483
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100
But that's really, you know, we're it's really pretty basic.

484
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,600
So really all we have to do is just make, I don't even really need to

485
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,500
cut and paste that, right?

486
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,000
It's super, super simple.

487
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,600
There's really nothing to it.

488
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,900
All we're doing.

489
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Here is saying

490
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,900
Like end simulation region or something, right?

491
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,800
And some region.

492
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,000
I guess you could just call it n Sim, right?

493
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,700
And that takes the same region.

494
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Okay, and then when I do that NSM, I'm going to Loop through all the

495
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,800
entity count, you know, I'm going to take this, I'm going to say for

496
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,200
each entity, right?

497
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,900
So I've got an empty index here for each entity.

498
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,000
That's in the region.

499
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,900
I want to map that entity out and into the low space, right?

500
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,300
So right here, again, we'd have that high entity, right?

501
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,000
And I guess we don't call them high these anymore.

502
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,100
They're just going to be entities.

503
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,000
So then we have an entity, right?

504
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,700
Like so.

505
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,000
That's going to point to this guy is going to point to the entities

506
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,100
that are in the region and each time through I'm going to advance that

507
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,300
pointer, right?

508
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,600
And so what we do each time through here is we just map The Entity

509
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,500
into the low space, right?

510
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
So basically what we're going to do here is I don't know what we'll

511
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,100
call this is that.

512
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,900
Exactly, but I guess we'll say, we'll say store entity, right?

513
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,700
Or something like that.

514
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,400
So we'll have low density and store energy.

515
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,400
I guess what we call them will load them out of the sort of that back

516
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,800
in store and then we'll store them back.

517
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,300
To it.

518
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,100
So we're going to store this entity out.

519
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,400
And so what we would need to know there is where were storing.

520
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,100
The end of the two will assume right now that that's stored in the

521
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,700
entity structure itself because that seems logical, right?

522
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
So we'll just do a store, entity will write that in a second that

523
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,800
maybe something we actually right here, in fact, we could just say

524
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,900
store entity and the reason that we don't really need a function for

525
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,900
it is because I'm thinking that, like I said, we will probably want to

526
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
do it so that you

527
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,100
Early, never ever ever translate between high low frequencies, any of

528
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,300
that stuff manually ever.

529
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,900
There's just a controlled load and store.

530
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,400
It could only happen in one place and it happens exactly the same way

531
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:11,800
every time.

532
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,600
So it might just happen right on in here, right?

533
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,200
So whatever we're going to call that in a second.

534
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,000
So then we also have the same thing here, right?

535
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,800
Which is begin Sim and that's again it's going to take a SIM region or

536
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,400
I guess rather.

537
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,300
What it probably would do is return a Sim region, so you'll do a begin

538
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,700
Sim.

539
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,100
You get a sim region back then you can do your Sim on that same region

540
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
when you're done, you end.

541
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,300
Right makes sense makes sense.

542
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,300
So inside begins him.

543
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,800
What we would be doing here is we would be doing the stuff that was

544
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,800
happening in this in this call right here, I like how we said do this

545
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,700
in terms of Tau chunks for it to do, which is exactly what we did.

546
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,800
So we want to do here again, is take this code that we already wrote,

547
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,600
that just looks at sort of that region in

548
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Little partition.

549
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,700
It says water all the entities in it.

550
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,800
And any of those entities that basically fall within the camera

551
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,400
balance are going to, you know we're going to find them are going to

552
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
pull them out.

553
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,700
And so we can do here is say that.

554
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,700
When you do your begin Sam, you just passed in that rectangle,

555
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,300
whatever, the rectangular trying Sim, right?

556
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
So this is the bounds of the region.

557
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,100
You pass that to begin, Sim and then that's what we use for

558
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,000
everything, right?

559
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,700
So camera bounds is now just region bounds, right?

560
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,600
Region, bounds?

561
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,300
Like so and the region bounds, I guess we need to also, give you what

562
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,500
it's centered around because that needs to be one of those, those

563
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,000
higher frequency positions, right?

564
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,900
That needs to be one of the more specific things, right?

565
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,600
So, this is the Region Center and that's the region bounds like

566
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,000
so-and-so.

567
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,200
Camera p is just reading center, right?

568
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,600
So there we go.

569
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,700
So we go ahead and we Loop through all of these things.

570
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,400
We find all of the entities that are relevant to us, and then we're

571
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,300
going to go ahead and map them out.

572
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
This also means that now, the low entities, right?

573
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,800
We no longer have the double pointer situation which is really good.

574
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,100
We do longer have low and he's pointing to highs and highs back to

575
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,400
lows.

576
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,700
We only have entities that point back to their storage location,

577
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,400
right?

578
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,800
Because that's something that we presumably always want.

579
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,600
To be able to do correctly, right?

580
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,000
Furthermore things are gonna get even better people.

581
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,700
They're going to get even better.

582
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Just you wait, I can see it.

583
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,800
Coming down the pipe.

584
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
I can see it.

585
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,000
Can you see it?

586
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,600
Yeah, maybe you can't see.

587
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,100
It doesn't matter.

588
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,900
It's there.

589
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:48,600
All right.

590
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Anyway,

591
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,400
so if we go ahead through here and we say all right we've got our low

592
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,900
entity, it no longer has to point to the high today because that's not

593
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,500
I haven't any more, right?

594
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
And then we no longer need this entity structure because you're only

595
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,600
ever going to be dealing with one or the other kind of entity.

596
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
I believe, I think we're going to want to do that, so that you just

597
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,700
everything kind of gets moved up into the high entity.

598
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
I'm not sure exactly how we'll handle that.

599
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,800
For now we're going to have to think about that a little bit more, so

600
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,500
this will go away eventually but I think I'm going to leave it just

601
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,300
for a little bit because as we sort of Port the code over, I don't

602
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,000
want to go too far too fast.

603
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,400
Alright, so basically the low entity indexes we now no longer have to

604
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,400
check to see or anything, whether they need to be moved in because

605
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,700
everyone needs to get moved in because no one's in the state yet,

606
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,300
right?

607
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,100
So what we need to do is we need to be able to sort of pull those guys

608
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,400
in.

609
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,200
And so what we're going to do here, I don't know exactly one of the

610
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,700
things is when we do this begin Sim it's a little unclear.

611
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,700
How we exactly want to divide up the memory that we're using because I

612
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,300
don't know how much we care about whether the entity array is

613
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,400
continuous or not.

614
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,600
It's something that and we don't know exactly how we're going to

615
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,300
process these.

616
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,900
So I'm not going to think too hard about that yet but later on because

617
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,900
we want this to be relatively, we want this code to be relatively fast

618
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,100
because once you build one of these begin Sims,

619
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,500
I want all the code that happens inside it to be fast.

620
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,600
We may have to think about how we're going to actually place these

621
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,900
things in memory, but for right now, I'm not think about that too

622
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,400
much.

623
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,000
All right, so we go through the end of the indexes.

624
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,400
We grab out where they are, we then have a pointer to the low.

625
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,300
And so, then right here what we need to do is we need to add it into

626
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,100
the to to the the same reagent, right?

627
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,300
So this would basically add a little entity to the same region will

628
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,000
call that.

629
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,100
I guess I'll just call that same for.

630
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,600
Now, I'll call some reach, call some region and that I guess we need

631
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,000
to do the check of the camera space p as well.

632
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
So this actually doesn't

633
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:52,700
Happen.

634
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,800
But this does because we don't want to move it into anything that's

635
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,500
not really in the camera region, so we'll do that.

636
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,900
And so, there we go.

637
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
So that's the check right there.

638
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,200
If it's in the rectangle, will add it in and we already know where the

639
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
cameras face p is.

640
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,200
So I feel like that should happen here as well, right?

641
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
So, that's where that is in camera space.

642
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,600
So that looks good.

643
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,300
So that is allows us to add an entity to it.

644
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,100
So it'll go a Danity.

645
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,600
like so, and I think that's about

646
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,000
It for that function for now.

647
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,600
All right.

648
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
So adding these going to take a SIM region

649
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,800
And it's going to add a new entity to the end here, right?

650
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,400
So for now we're going to do an assertion on this or I guess we'll do

651
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,700
an if statement like so.

652
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,200
Will do an if to verify that we have enough room.

653
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
So we want to make sure that the The Entity count is less than how

654
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,600
many we're allowed to store.

655
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,900
I like I said, later, we might allow this to be more flexible.

656
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,600
We'll see.

657
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,800
We'll see how I feel.

658
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Later on.

659
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,900
But assuming we're good to go there, I'm going to do an invalid code

660
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,000
path here as well.

661
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,300
Just so we know that it'll assert when it hit so we can see whether

662
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,500
we're overflowing or cap.

663
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,200
So we'll go ahead and do the fact that the entities Sim region

664
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,000
entities.

665
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,400
So

666
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,900
So basically, we're going to do is going to use a new entity from that

667
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,600
any list after making sure that we've got enough, I'm sorry, entity

668
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
array, and then that will go ahead and add the end of the.

669
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,600
Now, we've got the low entity, the low compressed version of him here.

670
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,400
I guess what I probably should do to is this should be a fairly

671
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,800
simplistic, you know, relatively straightforward entity, I don't know

672
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:44,900
you.

673
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,800
We could call this a Sim entity as well.

674
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Maybe I should just to differentiate it.

675
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,700
I like that.

676
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
I like that a lot.

677
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,400
So I think maybe we'll call that a same entity.

678
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,800
Yeah, okay, okay, that's good.

679
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,900
So let's call that a Sim entity and more turn that from here as well,

680
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,500
right?

681
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,200
Same entity.

682
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,500
And we will grab it like that so that will add it in a tea, but it

683
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,100
won't do anything particular to it.

684
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm going to clear it for now, like I said, I'm not sure whether we

685
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,600
actually care about that too much to do Casey.

686
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:31,200
See what we want to do about clearing policy when the entity system is

687
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,500
more fleshed out.

688
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,700
But for now, I'd like to clear 20 just to avoid bugs of that nature

689
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,900
because that way we know.

690
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,200
Everything is always every time you make it entities, always cleared

691
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,800
to a good initial State.

692
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,100
What I also could do is just clear out the whole array at startup.

693
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,400
I don't know.

694
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,500
We'll think about that.

695
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,800
But anyway, so when we get new entities, this will get basically give

696
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,700
them back to us and that's fine.

697
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,800
So the entities get added in there and I think that's really all we

698
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,100
need to do for that for now.

699
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,100
And then in the case, where you've got an entity that just

700
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,500
You a new entity, in the case where you're trying to add an entity in

701
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,100
a slightly more verbose fashion where you've got both the the low

702
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
entity version, right?

703
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,400
And so I guess I don't know we're going to call this I think we're

704
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,100
going to call us a storage on any probably, right?

705
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,700
And we could call it a whirl density.

706
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,500
We could have similarities and World entities.

707
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,600
So world of these are ones that are stored out in the world thing.

708
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm not sure exactly what they should be called sin.

709
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,400
Entity sounds good to me, because the entity that's involved in a

710
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,600
simulation region that makes sense, World entity, maybe is the right

711
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,100
thing.

712
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Because that's what it is.

713
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,700
We have the world storage.

714
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,500
We could change the name of that, instead of making it a world, we

715
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,800
could call that like spatial part, I don't know.

716
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,300
We're going to call it World Manatee for now.

717
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,400
So will basically say this is the source entity and this is going to

718
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,300
be the death penalty.

719
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,400
So basically we have a death entity that's that's going to get

720
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,600
received from here and assuming that we get one, we're going to say,

721
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
okay map.

722
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,400
Or like a convert the store identity to a simulation into tea.

723
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,000
Right?

724
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,500
So I don't know.

725
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,300
Yeah, it's still.

726
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,100
It's I think storage is the right thing because that's what I used

727
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,200
here when I was talking about it.

728
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,700
So it's going to call a store identity.

729
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,600
I like that and then I could call that store it as well.

730
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,000
Maybe.

731
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,300
Yeah.

732
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,100
Source is good.

733
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
All right, so let's call it.

734
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
Let's let's do it like that.

735
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,700
And then we also note here that that are oops, typo.

736
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,700
We also know Kira that our entity is potentially going to have a

737
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,400
physician passed to it, right?

738
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,700
Like we did here when you're creating one out of

739
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,600
No out of whole cloth like that, we know that you're going to have a

740
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
world position for him as well, right?

741
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,100
And so that's going to be okay, sorry that you shouldn't say World

742
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,400
position, a simulation position because you've already done the check

743
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,500
to see whether they should move in.

744
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,000
So you've already got that, right?

745
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,000
And so, basically, his simulation position is just going to get set

746
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,900
directly and doesn't have to be computed, right?

747
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,100
So that seems like a good idea.

748
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,600
What I could do is make this an address, do something like that and

749
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,100
then make this a pointer like so.

750
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,000
And then I could say you know if we know what it is, then great, if we

751
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,800
don't know what it is, then we go ahead and build it and that would

752
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,400
just be doing it like this, right?

753
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Let's get cameras they speak.

754
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,900
Now the problem is get camera, space p is actually not what we want

755
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,500
anymore either because we don't have a concept of a camera anymore.

756
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,300
I mean we do outside of this but the

757
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,300
Region itself, basically tracks where it thinks it is right.

758
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,400
It's got these two parameters baked into it, right?

759
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,600
There's the Region Center and the region Bounds at that.

760
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,699
All right.

761
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,800
Excuse me.

762
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:00,300
So we want that to actually be, we want, we want the Region Center and

763
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,900
bounced to actually be the things that are used.

764
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,800
Not any kind of a notion of a camera.

765
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,700
So get camera space p really should never be happening anymore.

766
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,600
Get camera, space p.

767
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
It's just a special case.

768
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,000
So we want to we want to kind of get rid of that and say all right

769
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,500
instead of gets cameras paste P.

770
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,600
What we've got here is something else, we've basically got something

771
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,800
that's like get region space p.

772
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,600
If you will, we have get region.

773
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,600
Space p.

774
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,900
And that just takes a Sim region, right?

775
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,500
Like so

776
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,000
And it takes whatever that store identity is.

777
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,900
and,

778
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,300
And that's will do the conversion.

779
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
So it does the diff it.

780
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,500
Does that subtraction?

781
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,800
We're going to need the world pointer here.

782
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,700
So I'm going to assume that the the Sim it set.

783
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,500
The same region will store a pointer to that world.

784
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
So I can grab it.

785
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:56,100
It will go ahead and use its pee now, right.

786
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,200
It's what do we call that it's center, right?

787
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,800
Or I should,

788
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,700
Use the word origin because that's kind of a little bit better origin

789
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,400
at the same region and that should basically give us what we want to

790
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,000
have happen.

791
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,800
So there we go.

792
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,600
We'll need to store again in the same region will need to store the

793
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
world so that we can get back to it.

794
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,200
So when we call begin Sim, we're going to need to use that world

795
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
parameter here, right?

796
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,200
So we're going to have a SIM region world and we're going to have to

797
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,400
set these them region.

798
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,100
Origin, equals origin Sim region bounds equals bounds like so on.

799
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,200
There we go.

800
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,300
Lovely.

801
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,100
So that looks reasonable, right?

802
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,800
And now we have a get region space p which is exactly what we want.

803
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,700
So we can pass the same region to it'll get a 3D space V and down

804
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,700
here, that same thing can be used instead of camera space p.

805
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,900
So now this can just use some region origin, so so region origin and

806
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,000
then Min corner for the same reason bounds.

807
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,100
Okay.

808
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:15,700
And similarly, in here, we should be able to do some region origin and

809
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,000
this should be get region, space key.

810
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And that should be able to face take the read the same region there

811
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
and this is Sims case P, right?

812
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,500
What did I actually?

813
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,600
Region space.

814
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,700
It really shouldn't be called region space.

815
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,200
It's really be called Sim Space.

816
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,500
Probably write some space key sounds a little bit better.

817
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,100
So let's say that get-get region space is going to be gets in space

818
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,100
like that a little bit better.

819
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,000
Alright, so that seems good.

820
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,300
Everything seems reasonable there.

821
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,800
Lovely.

822
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,300
And so, what we're going to need now is I guess we're going to need to

823
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,600
sort of just do some, some sort of Smashing here to smash everything

824
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,900
back into a reasonable State.

825
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,300
Here is the stuff that we know we needed before on here.

826
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
So, this will be a storage index and this is basically something that

827
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
tells us where this entity came from, right.

828
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,900
This is all relative to the same region but we don't need to comment

829
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,300
that really as much anymore, because, it's now it's much much clearer.

830
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,100
We can put some comments at the top potentially the talk about that a

831
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,700
little bit more and so, there we go.

832
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,900
Now Artie Bob is an animation thing that I don't think we want to have

833
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,200
any more.

834
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,700
But what is this?

835
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,600
Does mean very clearly.

836
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,300
And this was sort of something that probably should have happened

837
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,500
originally

838
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:46,900
Generally.

839
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,000
Anyway, which is that velocity?

840
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,600
Is now something that has to be stored across frame boundaries?

841
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Obviously velocity is something that has to be stored in the low

842
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
entity as well, right?

843
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,800
So, in the low entity,

844
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,300
In order for things to persist we need to keep that velocity around so

845
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
that's going to go in there.

846
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,800
Hi Ade basically goes away entirely.

847
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,800
That's just gone.

848
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,300
So our similarity has this information in it.

849
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,300
Yeah.

850
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,100
That that it wouldn't otherwise if needed

851
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Same with the facing Direction.

852
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,300
And even I guess T-Bob for now,

853
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,500
Can go out into the low entity because the low energy is really, we're

854
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,600
going to be focusing all of our attention in terms of splitting things

855
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:26,800
up.

856
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Anyway.

857
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,400
So that seems pretty fine, pretty, pretty good to me.

858
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,600
So we've got our z and d z.

859
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,000
This this chunks, the this stuff we're going to have to clean up a

860
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
little bit because we did add Vector 3 eventually.

861
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,500
But we've never really quite gotten around to handling Z in a logical

862
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:40,900
way.

863
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,400
We're going to postpone that for now again because one thing at a time

864
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,800
So that's all good.

865
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,800
Now we need to do is start actually making this work a little bit

866
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,000
more.

867
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Straightforwardly by cleaning up the code that we do have and making

868
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
it work within these confines.

869
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,900
Now, one thing I do need to do is I need to be able to actually

870
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,700
allocate one of these Sim regions.

871
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,600
Right?

872
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,800
And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to for the first time in

873
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,200
introduced the concept of a transient of the of the transient stack,

874
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,700
basically?

875
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,900
And so that's something that I think we probably won't have time to do

876
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,100
today.

877
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,500
So I'm just going to leave it as a placeholder and then we'll do it,

878
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,700
we'll do it tomorrow.

879
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,600
So if I go ahead here and I say we've got our memory Arenas right?

880
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm going to say that we will have some way of doing this a little bit

881
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,000
more fancy late in tomorrow.

882
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,000
So we're going to say here that we based have a memory Arena which is

883
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,800
the simmer Ena and later on we're going to have a more stronger notion

884
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,700
of where that's coming from.

885
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200
For now we're just going to use that.

886
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,900
and so, from the simmer Rena, we are going to allocate

887
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,300
The space that we need to store the simulation system.

888
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,100
So what we need to do here is we just need to do a push struct right?

889
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
On the simmer Rena.

890
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Excuse me to push our Sim region.

891
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,500
Like so we need to initialize vatsim.

892
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,200
Oops, region.

893
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:24,400
We need to initialize the, The Entity bounce for that, right?

894
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,200
So we need the entities, some region.

895
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,400
Mac said we count.

896
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,200
We The Entity count itself, which we want to start at zero and I'll go

897
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,900
ahead and move these into the order.

898
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,800
They're actually in.

899
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,900
So as world origin, bounce back some account edit account.

900
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,800
So the max entity count for now, we'll set up something High to do,

901
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:53,200
Casey need to be more specific about entity counts.

902
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,600
In fact, this could actually be very high because this is a transient

903
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:57,700
problem.

904
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
Is anything we could really set this extremely high.

905
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,900
We're using it very large scratch space basically.

906
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,400
So we could, we could think about that a little bit later.

907
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,100
How exactly we want to, we want to deal with that process, basically.

908
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,100
And then are entities.

909
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,500
We should there's there was, I believe, was there already a push a

910
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,700
reg.

911
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,800
Yes, there was a push array.

912
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,600
So what we can do is we can go ahead and get our way of entities as

913
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,000
well.

914
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,500
So there we go.

915
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,200
See, Marina.

916
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,700
The count is going to be that Mack sennett account right in a thing,

917
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,000
it is a semantic, right?

918
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So that grabs all of those entities, and then when we're done here,

919
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,800
what will basically do is, you know, we'll assume that this Arena

920
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,900
releases the memory that we've used.

921
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,400
So, we basically grab all the memory up front, we do all the

922
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,200
processing and then we push it away.

923
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,600
That makes sense, and we'll have to deal with that later.

924
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,000
So

925
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,500
I'm, there we go.

926
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,200
What we do our enzyme, we just need to do the store back to low, which

927
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,800
at the moment, I guess we can actually Implement because we already

928
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
have the code for it.

929
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,800
It's a make entity low-frequency, right?

930
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,500
That's this code right here.

931
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,700
And so if I just go ahead and add that in, you can just grab the parts

932
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,800
of it that we wanted.

933
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,800
Essentially we already know what the

934
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,100
We already know that we don't care about the high frequency index at

935
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:16,400
all.

936
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
All we care about is the low frequency Index, right?

937
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,200
And so that low-frequency index is going to be, whatever, was in this

938
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,000
storage Index right here, right?

939
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,300
So we basically have that entity storage index tells us where the

940
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
Senate he's going to go.

941
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,600
Nothing scuse me.

942
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,200
I'm still sick as often.

943
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,000
I am on the Stream.

944
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,300
Can't stop programming, just cause you're sick.

945
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,400
You gotta keep you gotta power through.

946
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,100
I mean, if you're really sick then don't program if you're really

947
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,800
really sick but you know, I'm certainly well enough to program it that

948
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,000
way.

949
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,800
All right, so I grab my editi here.

950
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,800
Mmm.

951
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,700
Let's take a look at this here.

952
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
We've got the region and account.

953
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,700
We're going through envies.

954
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,100
That's what I want.

955
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,400
We have the storage index.

956
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,200
So the storage index is based going to put these back into that low

957
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,700
entity array, right?

958
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,700
And so, where we have that was actually in the game state, which is

959
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,100
not necessarily where I would necessarily like them to be.

960
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,200
I think those maybe she would be better served now that I think about

961
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,600
it in the world but

962
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:40,300
We can talk about that later, let's see to do, maybe don't take a game

963
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,600
State here.

964
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,500
Low entities should be stored in the world, something like that, but

965
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,400
for now we'll go ahead and do that.

966
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,200
So, in order to get the low energy out, right?

967
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,700
We've got the low energy which we're going to change the name of I

968
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,900
guess to store identity, right?

969
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,800
So, the stored

970
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
is going to be the game state store identities, for now,

971
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,100
Something like this, we're going to go ahead and grab those out like

972
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,500
so.

973
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:11,700
You know what?

974
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,200
I guess before I change the name, I guess I could do store it into T's

975
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,900
just still low entity just to make the porting a little easier at

976
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,100
first, and we'll just make that up to do.

977
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,500
Do Casey change the name?

978
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,900
Stored entity.

979
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,300
All right, so we grabbed the store identity, we don't care about this.

980
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,500
That was some debug code.

981
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,600
We don't care about any of this.

982
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,800
So I guess we didn't in that code.

983
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,500
We didn't actually do the packing there and make entity low frequency.

984
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,300
We didn't actually ever update that code.

985
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,500
So, this is just kind of garbage code, really?

986
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,200
It doesn't even work anymore, so that's no good.

987
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Now, the entity pairs goes away because entities are no longer paired

988
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:02,700
in that sense.

989
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,700
Use only a pointer back in One Direction so they don't really get

990
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,500
validated.

991
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,700
And, and for sanity into high doesn't make any sense.

992
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,200
Either offset and check frequency by

993
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,200
We got rid of because we now have that that concept you never actually

994
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,400
do move things out.

995
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,300
So that's fine.

996
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,400
So that goes away.

997
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,800
So that's good.

998
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,600
Make any high frequency.

999
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,200
We already essentially did is the camera space p part, which is done.

1000
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,700
So that goes away as well.

1001
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,000
This is the part that we actually well, no, we don't need that either.

1002
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,700
Yeah, we don't need that.

1003
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,900
Either really because we've already replaced that entirely as well as

1004
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,800
all of this.

1005
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,000
So, yeah.

1006
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,200
So that's good.

1007
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,200
We don't really need any of this all goes away.

1008
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,200
It's all toasted at this point, add familiar.

1009
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,300
So, what we need to do now is, it's this part right here, change

1010
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,700
entity location is really the part that we care about.

1011
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,400
So that was the thing that I was looking for, for this code to give me

1012
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
and it turned out that code have nothing to do with it.

1013
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,900
So what I want to do here is as we spend through them, this is the

1014
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,300
part that actually to update.

1015
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,500
We have a to do here which is basically like, you know, Save State

1016
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,200
back to the store identity, but right now, once High entities

1017
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,200
Do state decompression.

1018
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,500
But for right now, I suppose we don't really have that now.

1019
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,700
Maybe what we could do is we could say that all of the things exist in

1020
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,900
the same entity as well.

1021
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,600
That's kind of an interesting idea.

1022
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,300
I'm not sure you want to take that step yet.

1023
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,000
So we'll just say that that's going to change a little bit later on.

1024
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,700
All right, so when we change entity location, we pass all the same

1025
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,100
stuff for the game State.

1026
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,800
And now this right here is that stored index.

1027
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
So, this is the storage and do.

1028
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,700
Of the entity, right?

1029
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,500
We have that low version of him, we know where he is because that's

1030
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,500
that's just that and then we have his new position is basically going

1031
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:18,200
to be whatever we derive from that, excuse me.

1032
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,000
From that chunk space mapping.

1033
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,600
So what we'll do is we'll take that new paint that same set of calls

1034
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,000
here.

1035
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,500
And now it's not going to be the cameras location anymore.

1036
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,600
Again, it's the Region's location that were mapping around and then we

1037
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,600
have that offset from that stored in our entity, which is just the P,

1038
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,100
so that just works, right?

1039
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,200
Okay.

1040
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,000
So that all looks good.

1041
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,100
Pretty straightforward, pretty straightforward, so that's good.

1042
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,100
And now set camera.

1043
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,600
Pretty much doesn't do anything.

1044
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,400
If I'm not mistaken, let's take a look.

1045
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,700
So, basically, we don't need to do any of this.

1046
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,300
We need this in something.

1047
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,100
We need to save.

1048
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,500
Just this concept of how big the camera was.

1049
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,800
So I'm basically going to I'm going to move that into.

1050
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,700
I'm going to save just this piece, right?

1051
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,700
Like so, so we don't need this.

1052
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,400
We don't need any of that.

1053
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,800
We don't need this anymore, we don't need this.

1054
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,800
So really all we need to do here.

1055
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:32,600
This will be some kind of function basically where we choose me.

1056
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,600
This will just be some kind of function where we actually do our begin

1057
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:42,600
and some so it'd be something like, you know, Sim camera region or

1058
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,900
something like this, right?

1059
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,500
And we wouldn't actually need a new camera P.

1060
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,500
We would just go ahead and say, all right, take the game state.

1061
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,100
Figure out how big we want that camera bound to be and then just go

1062
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,100
ahead here and do the begin some Ensign pair, right?

1063
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
So it's going to be like, oops.

1064
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,700
It's going to be like, all right, you know, here's our Sim region.

1065
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
Go ahead and make it.

1066
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,400
We don't know exactly what that region is yet, but that's fine.

1067
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,600
We've got the world and we've got the origins going to be the camera.

1068
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,000
So this is the camera P, right?

1069
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,600
And then we've got those camera bounds that we just computed.

1070
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,600
So this is the region.

1071
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,100
We want to sim we go ahead and do that and then we'll, you know,

1072
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,800
Write some code in there for actually simulating the entities, which

1073
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,100
we haven't quite done yet.

1074
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,700
And there we go.

1075
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,400
So that's all we really need to do now.

1076
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,700
So Sim camera region, we just collapsed and we could probably just

1077
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,600
move this whole thing back down into the main game loop.

1078
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,700
It's not really even a function anymore for all intents and purposes.

1079
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,600
So, really, what we got to do now is is just that, right?

1080
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,900
We

1081
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Do that right here.

1082
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,900
Nothing fancy about it, there's our Sim.

1083
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,800
And then when we do this here, this is updating where the camera is

1084
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
actually supposed to be.

1085
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,400
So what we want to do there, I think.

1086
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,300
Is I think will actually want to update the camera when we do the

1087
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,200
simulation end, right?

1088
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,800
So what we'd want to do is basically this we'd want to do that right

1089
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,200
here.

1090
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,400
So this will update the camera for us.

1091
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,300
If that makes any sense, when we actually have things in the hiset

1092
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
right before, we're done.

1093
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,500
If the, if the camera was supposed to be following in any it will, and

1094
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,100
we might make this into a more General system later, that actually can

1095
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,100
do stuff on anything, but that's definitely the right place for it.

1096
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,500
So we'll take a look at that when the time comes.

1097
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,700
All right, so that's about all of the Restriction that we need to do

1098
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,200
there.

1099
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,000
This will actually do that Sim then we'll do the render, right?

1100
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,500
And I guess we don't want to end the same till after we do the render

1101
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,500
because we probably want to walk.

1102
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,500
The SIM for our rendering, right?

1103
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,300
So we probably want to do it.

1104
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,400
Like this.

1105
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,800
And in fact, the simulation in the renderer might kind of be working

1106
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,800
together, right?

1107
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,700
Because we that's the way we're doing it before and that may just

1108
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,100
happen.

1109
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,000
So will Bridge the Sim will Bridge across the two of those?

1110
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,100
And so then when it goes through these, we no longer have a concept of

1111
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,600
a zero index on high entity.

1112
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,100
We don't have to anymore because now there is nothing that refers to

1113
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,400
high entities ever for the most part.

1114
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,300
Excuse me.

1115
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,900
Well, I think about that.

1116
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,100
We are going to need a way.

1117
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,200
For people to point, we are going to need a mapping.

1118
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,700
Basically that allows you to get from low entities that reference each

1119
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,500
other up to hyades.

1120
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,700
We could do that with a map or we could do that in place, so we'll

1121
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,600
kind of have to see how we exactly want to do that.

1122
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm not sure.

1123
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,500
A map is definitely one easy way to do it or a hash table would be one

1124
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,700
easy way to do it and I'm not sure if we want to do something.

1125
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I think that probably the smarter way to do it wouldn't be very

1126
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,700
expensive.

1127
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,200
I think that would be a smarter way to do it than actually threading

1128
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,900
it through like it was now because I don't think you want all those

1129
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
pointers running around.

1130
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
So I think we'll probably be able to Hash table so we're gonna get rid

1131
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,200
of the concept that there's a that you ever ndex intentionally in the

1132
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:25,900
high into the array.

1133
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,000
That way you'll just use a pointer or something similar.

1134
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,100
All right, so I think we are good to go there.

1135
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,600
So here we'll just go through that same region, it's entity count, 60

1136
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,400
entity index, like so this is will get much cleaner.

1137
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,500
Now, I think and this will have an entity like this same region.

1138
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,200
Entities.

1139
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,300
And so that's M region will go ahead and loop over that.

1140
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,800
We don't need low.

1141
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,600
Use anymore.

1142
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,100
Although we kind of still do have to do them temporarily because we

1143
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,400
aren't really fully decompressing in and compressing in and out or

1144
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,900
anything like that.

1145
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,500
So we're going to temporarily leave those in until we get a further a

1146
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,600
little bit further along.

1147
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Excuse me, on the porting.

1148
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,900
So we'll still have our entity and Arlo entity will have to sort of

1149
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,300
pick up the slack in a couple places.

1150
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,600
We don't care about this anymore.

1151
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,800
We get our GT for the frame, we have our low entities facing

1152
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,400
Direction,

1153
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,900
Still there blowing, 50 60 and let's see what else we have to do.

1154
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,400
This is all drawing.

1155
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,300
These are all just drawing calls.

1156
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,000
So update sword.

1157
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,700
For now, I guess we'll take both of these and same with update.

1158
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,600
Familiar update.

1159
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,200
Monstar those will want to actually pass both of them.

1160
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,800
Probably.

1161
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,900
And then from there, I guess the high

1162
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,300
T, let's see here.

1163
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,000
What if we got I don't know.

1164
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,600
I don't again since we're kind of in the middle here.

1165
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,600
I don't remember where the split was on some of these things.

1166
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,100
So let's see.

1167
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,200
Handmade

1168
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:11,800
Sim region.

1169
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:14,500
All right.

1170
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:16,800
So yeah.

1171
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,800
So most of these stuff this stuff is actually on the other type of

1172
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,700
entity now but that's okay, we're no longer doing this this piece

1173
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,200
group.

1174
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,500
This all looks completely, non empty based so that's good.

1175
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,800
So really only all over.

1176
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,400
The only thing we're dealing with is this this is still using that

1177
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,500
entity P.

1178
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:38,700
Like so high entities Z that is still.

1179
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,900
Yes, entity Z into Z XT Z

1180
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,900
Still entity everything.

1181
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,100
Here is still on empty.

1182
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
That's fine.

1183
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,800
And it looks like there isn't anything else in particular so those

1184
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,900
still are on the low end of T which is all good.

1185
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,100
So that's all good.

1186
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,300
The most part.

1187
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,500
All right, that looks nice.

1188
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,700
So the really what we have to deal with now is just the update, the

1189
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:10,100
update calls, I think as most of it and the other thing we're going to

1190
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,300
want to do is move that code for the from the player we're going to.

1191
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,800
On a move that down as well.

1192
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:15,500
Alright.

1193
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,000
So let's see how we're doing here.

1194
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:20,700
We got to go ahead and include our Sim region as well.

1195
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,900
So and made

1196
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:29,500
Same region dot CPP and handmade same region.

1197
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,300
H.

1198
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,900
And I'm actually think that should go there.

1199
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,900
That should probably go up here.

1200
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,600
So let's go ahead and start our debugging process.

1201
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,800
Let's get rid of this for now because I want that to be going

1202
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,700
eventually entirely.

1203
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,600
So let's just assume that we get rid of it entirely.

1204
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,300
Let's see, Sim region entities

1205
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:54,900
Excuse me.

1206
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,500
Let's go ahead and do that cases style.

1207
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,200
There we go.

1208
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,600
Binary equals operator found, let's see.

1209
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,600
Simpie, right, that's it, pointer to let's see.

1210
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,500
Low against his fate, for the low entity, that's actually Source,

1211
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:16,000
entity, to type out game, State low, entity is plus, sorted index.

1212
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,600
The game state is undefined, that is actually true.

1213
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,900
It is undefined.

1214
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,500
So, we have to pass that here as well.

1215
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,100
And so, this would be another comment where I'd say, we passed the

1216
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,800
game state, but to do

1217
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Do if entities were restored in the world.

1218
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,000
We wouldn't need the game State here, right?

1219
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,100
So let's just something to think about, right?

1220
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,000
All right.

1221
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,100
So let's see.

1222
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,400
This is actually the same region bounds.

1223
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,000
Let's go ahead and file that we've got.

1224
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,300
Our entity is a Sim entity, that's proper there.

1225
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,600
We have our up and we're at the Q&A.

1226
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,000
So I think I'm going to stop soon.

1227
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:04,300
I might just take quickly go through the rest of this pass, just to

1228
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,600
clean up some of these but that's where we'll end it store it into

1229
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,600
sees, what are the stored entities that is?

1230
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,500
Hello entities for now, right now, right about that, loyalty to low

1231
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,300
entity star.

1232
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,500
Here we go.

1233
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,000
Entity camera, following entity for sanity into high case.

1234
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,400
We don't actually need that anymore.

1235
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,200
That would basically just be something that we use to sort of get with

1236
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,100
that is and so that would maybe be our first case to do that hash

1237
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,500
table.

1238
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,900
This is basically be entity mapping hash table.

1239
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,600
And that's something that we'll want to do.

1240
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,800
I'll guess I'll put that here as well.

1241
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,300
To do.

1242
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,700
Need a hash table here to map low entity into C's, or I should say

1243
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,300
stored in the end of these two SIM entities,

1244
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,300
All right, so it's time for the Q&A.

1245
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,000
So I'm going to stop here.

1246
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,600
I think we have a plenty more work to do to sort of, get everything

1247
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,200
organized.

1248
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,500
So I don't want to go any further into the Q&A.

1249
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,000
We'll do it tomorrow properly.

1250
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,800
So yeah.

1251
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:14,700
If you want to go ahead and preface your coal questions with q:, that

1252
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,400
would be excellent.

1253
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,200
So I can see them and please try to keep your question stuff.

1254
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,600
We've done today or on previous dreams.

1255
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,900
If you want to ask questions about other stuff, please come 15 minutes

1256
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,800
before a scheduled start time of a stream and we do

1257
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,900
Off topic questions, then.

1258
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,600
Recommendations for names instead of stored entities.

1259
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,600
You can have the stasis entity and stasis region for the

1260
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,300
high-frequency.

1261
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,100
You would keep the Sim.

1262
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:55,200
Regents them entity.

1263
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,800
Yeah, I don't really like stasis necessarily because they're not in

1264
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,300
stasis.

1265
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,900
They're just being

1266
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,300
Stored temporarily, they're still active entities in some sense,

1267
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:03,700
right?

1268
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,400
So I don't know.

1269
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:09,400
I'm not sure it's hard to say sim region and some entity seems good

1270
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,800
stored restore or storage any?

1271
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,400
I don't know.

1272
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,900
World storage and store identity.

1273
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,200
I don't know what to think about them.

1274
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,800
They're kind of just being stored away till we need to come.

1275
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,700
Grab them out again.

1276
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,800
Since we know that an entity speed is bounded, couldn't we calculate a

1277
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,800
Sim region with bounds such that no entity can move outside of it

1278
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,400
during the frame that way.

1279
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Anything that the entity could collide with will be pulled into the

1280
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,100
same region?

1281
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,800
No, unfortunately, not because it's a, it's an unbounded problem,

1282
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,600
right?

1283
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,100
This is what I was trying to say.

1284
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,000
So let's say that you start with this Sim region bound and you say all

1285
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,600
right.

1286
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,900
These are the entities that are in that bound.

1287
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,300
Well, I know that this person can't move any further than this, right?

1288
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,800
So my new sim region bound would be here, but the problem is that now

1289
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,000
pulls in this entity and so then you have to do the same process

1290
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,300
again.

1291
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,100
Oh, well I know that this entity can only go that far.

1292
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,400
So, here's my new sim region bound, which pulls in this entity and I

1293
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,100
know that that entity could only move that far which falls in this

1294
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,300
one, right?

1295
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,000
So it

1296
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,200
What's happening is if you if all the entities in the same region are

1297
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,200
considered live, it will grow forever to Encompass the whole world.

1298
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,100
So what you have to do is have a notion of a lot of Live And non-live

1299
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,200
entities inside the same region and it'll be really easy for us to

1300
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,500
deal with.

1301
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,800
Don't have to do any special code.

1302
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,900
All we have to do is not update ones that are outside that boundary

1303
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:43,700
right.

1304
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,100
In fact, I'll make a note of that here.

1305
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,200
Just remember to do it.

1306
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,900
Basically, what we want to do here.

1307
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,500
Is to do check a second rectangle.

1308
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:04,500
To set the entity to be movable or not, right?

1309
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,800
And maybe that should actually be done in here.

1310
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,600
Well, we'll see.

1311
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,100
Because entities could get created.

1312
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,700
Yeah, it's a long story anyway.

1313
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
My paint source code.

1314
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,100
Ah cool.

1315
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,300
So my paint does that source code so I could possibly go fix that.

1316
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,400
How many to dues do you have a lot?

1317
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,300
I put lots of two dudes in the code.

1318
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:35,700
Basically.

1319
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:40,300
I don't hardly ever look at to dues until later in the project, but I

1320
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,300
like to put them in because you could always go look and go, oh,

1321
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,300
that's not relevant anymore.

1322
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,100
And delete it.

1323
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,000
But if you forget one that's bad.

1324
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So at the end of the project, you want to be able to have a way to

1325
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,400
search for them and just see and make sure that there wasn't something

1326
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,300
critical like to do.

1327
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,300
This will explode.

1328
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,200
You don't want that, you know, to stay in there, right?

1329
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,600
So we have a thing.

1330
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,700
Actually.

1331
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,800
In here somewhere.

1332
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,800
Let's see.

1333
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,900
So we have a thing called Static check right and static check will

1334
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,900
check for for Global variables so we can do in the code base we can

1335
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,900
say static check.

1336
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,500
Oops.

1337
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:24,600
And that'll tell us everywhere that anyone used a static, right?

1338
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,700
Which is pretty awesome because it can verify that we never have them,

1339
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,800
which is what I wanted.

1340
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,800
And so that's just kind of cool.

1341
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,100
So what we can also do is we can make it a similar thing inside a

1342
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:38,800
static shock, which is like to do check, right?

1343
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,800
And that would be something that would allow us to do just a quick

1344
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,400
sort of validation thing where we do like to do is found.

1345
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,100
And then it would just look for that right?

1346
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,100
Or something like this.

1347
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,800
And so,

1348
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:58,300
See and this way I can just quickly like at the end when we're

1349
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,700
shipping will go through and remove all the to dues that are no longer

1350
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,200
relevant and we can go through it address.

1351
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
The ones that aren't are relevant, right?

1352
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,500
So to do is very good.

1353
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,900
I think they're a good thing.

1354
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,300
They don't cost you anything to put in and if they're unlike comments

1355
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,500
that are trying to like tell the person something I don't like to use

1356
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,400
comments a lot because they tend to end up being wrong to do is really

1357
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,300
aren't that way because you can quickly when you're doing your due

1358
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:24,500
process.

1359
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,200
You just go through and see if they're wrong.

1360
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
Is throw them out.

1361
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,000
They don't have that same - downside that comments do to me.

1362
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,800
How will you handle the disparity and update rate between off-screen

1363
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,700
and on-screen unities?

1364
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,600
Does it matter?

1365
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:47,200
The answer is, hopefully it won't matter too much, but it might.

1366
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:52,100
And so really what we're going to want to do is, we're going to try

1367
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,700
and want to keep that as very low.

1368
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,700
Like hopefully we'll be able to write some pretty fast update code so

1369
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,900
that we can handle lots of enemies and it's not too big of a deal.

1370
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,100
So that it will be like a difference of like normally entities up to

1371
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,500
60 frames a second and then off-screen, you know, the rest of the

1372
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:15,500
world updates it like, you know, something like instead of 30 frames

1373
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,900
per second or 60 frames a second, they operate it like five frames a

1374
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,700
second which isn't that big of a deal like things probably won't break

1375
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,300
but if it turns out that it's more like once every 5 seconds or once

1376
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,900
every 10 seconds, we're going to have to do some extra work to support

1377
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,000
that but we'll see.

1378
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,400
What happens when we get there?

1379
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,100
Well the same region away from the player calls.

1380
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,700
Large time steps from the north.

1381
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,200
Yeah, so that's the base of the same question.

1382
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,300
So yeah, so the problem is always going to be, we still want to

1383
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,100
simulate the world as fast as possible.

1384
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,800
So we're still going to want to try and keep the number of sweeps

1385
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
through the world to be relatively High.

1386
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,400
But yeah, hopefully it won't be too bad.

1387
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,900
If it is then we have to take steps to then we have to actually start

1388
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:13,800
writing some extra code to do more efficient updates of people when

1389
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,700
they're when they're in that other SIM region, right?

1390
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:27,200
I missed whether this new system is based around discrete rooms or

1391
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,600
integer map coordinates.

1392
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,400
If it's based on rooms, would it be trivial to think in cords instead?

1393
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,900
It's not based on rooms it's just it's free-floating it's just a

1394
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,300
camera region and that camera region can be anywhere.

1395
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,700
What will happen if your sim region and player location are at the

1396
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,300
same place with a bug out?

1397
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,100
No.

1398
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,400
So we have two options and I don't know which one of them are going to

1399
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,000
want to do.

1400
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,600
But basically what we'll have is we'll probably use something like a

1401
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:03,100
generation index and the generation index will tell us how many Sim

1402
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,800
steps forward each thing has gone.

1403
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,200
And so what we'll probably do is store some kind of a generation

1404
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,600
index, like you know, I leave.

1405
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,700
I'll put a note in here, too.

1406
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,200
So, do it.

1407
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,300
Generation index.

1408
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,000
So we know how up to date this entity is.

1409
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,400
Basically we'll store something in there that lets us know how

1410
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,800
recently he was processed.

1411
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:36,100
So there's two regions overlap or if the camera region comes into

1412
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:39,000
somebody who hasn't been updated, it needs to know how much updating

1413
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,900
to do for them.

1414
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,500
We should basically be able to do something that does are some

1415
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,500
reasonable job there.

1416
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,500
Again it's going to still be a little complicated.

1417
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,200
We'll have to work out a couple things because again scaling up

1418
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,300
everything and making everything work nice and clean is hard this

1419
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,100
though I think

1420
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,900
Architecture gets us a huge portion of the way there which is good,

1421
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,600
but there are still going to be a few things that we're going to have

1422
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:01,900
to.

1423
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,700
We're gonna have to see how they work out in practice.

1424
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,300
Why is the low high frequency system?

1425
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:16,899
So important isn't creating basic gameplay rules and AI interactions

1426
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:19,800
in a small world more aligned with your philosophy of doing the simple

1427
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,600
thing first?

1428
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:26,600
No, so I think I don't want to give a misleading.

1429
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,399
I don't, I want to be 100% clear.

1430
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,600
When I say, do the simple thing first that doesn't mean do the wrong

1431
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:33,899
thing.

1432
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:34,399
First,

1433
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,000
What I mean, is Implement, whatever.

1434
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,300
Do whatever you can to get the thing working that you need working.

1435
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,100
Right?

1436
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,800
And I know I want to be able to scale The Entity count up high.

1437
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,000
That's a requirement.

1438
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's not an option.

1439
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,700
I'm saying flat-out, we want to be able to create as many entities as

1440
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:51,399
we want.

1441
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:57,100
Like if we want literally to have 30 million entities in this game, I

1442
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,200
want it to be able to work, right?

1443
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,300
So that's a hard requirement of the it's not negotiable.

1444
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,700
So I did do exactly what I said which was right.

1445
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,800
What would make that work?

1446
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,600
I just started typing it and you saw what we did we did the low

1447
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,500
frequency High, everything I was like, all right, let's try this.

1448
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,700
Let's try mapping between them and we kind of got that going and the

1449
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,000
same was true of the of the large World thing.

1450
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,000
I was like, okay, we got a map in and out.

1451
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,399
And so I did exactly that process of going through and doing whatever

1452
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,300
came to mind to get it working.

1453
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,200
And then I realized right now, which was very

1454
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:30,899
Be for me.

1455
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,700
I realized last night because I felt like eventually we would see the

1456
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,200
right solution.

1457
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,100
I think we now have

1458
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,000
I finally was like, ah, yes.

1459
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,200
Now I see how to architect this.

1460
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,200
So all of the problems go away, right?

1461
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,100
And I think that's what this will do for us.

1462
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,399
It'll be a success to a point where now everything is nice and clean

1463
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:48,800
and it's very easy to code for.

1464
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:53,100
And the reason that I wanted to do this first was because everything

1465
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,500
we write from now on will be in terms of this thing.

1466
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,500
So, starting with something that doesn't handle any of the things that

1467
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,200
we need to handle is not the same as writing.

1468
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,500
The simple thing first.

1469
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:11,400
As writing, the simple thing first is only valuable simple isn't the

1470
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,100
right word for it.

1471
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,800
I guess is what I would say, it's whatever you can think to do that,

1472
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,300
satisfies the requirements.

1473
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,200
And sometimes that means the simple thing, right?

1474
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:23,000
And in a sense case it's I would even still describe it that way.

1475
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,100
Write the simplest thing, you can think of that, does what you need it

1476
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:30,200
to do which is what I did, but it still needs to do what you need it

1477
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:30,700
to do.

1478
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,800
You can't write something that doesn't do what you want to do just

1479
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,700
because it's simple.

1480
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,100
Because then you've learned nothing, right?

1481
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:41,300
And so that's really, really crucial to understand the difference

1482
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:46,000
between those two things over designing means trying to actually make

1483
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,200
a complete system before you actually understand how it has to work,

1484
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:50,800
right?

1485
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,100
Moving away from that.

1486
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,900
Doesn't mean writing something that doesn't actually satisfy the

1487
01:10:58,900 --> 01:10:59,400
requirements.

1488
01:10:59,400 --> 01:10:59,900
You have.

1489
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,300
So what you want to do is you want to write something as

1490
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,900
straightforwardly as you can, that satisfies the requirements and then

1491
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,300
you want to architect up from that.

1492
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,200
And that's exactly what we did.

1493
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,500
I wrote the most straightforward code as I was going and you saw how I

1494
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,300
was kind of getting complicated and nasty.

1495
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,500
And then I was like, ah, I see how we can do the architecture.

1496
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,300
Now that makes these things

1497
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,100
I'm clean.

1498
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,400
So the other thing to think about is these systems are different.

1499
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:36,300
So when you said, you know, why not get AI interactions or gameplay

1500
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,000
rules, those are different systems.

1501
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,400
How we handle?

1502
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,900
Where look things are spatially.

1503
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,500
Has nothing to do with how the eye works, right?

1504
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,200
The AI has to use those systems but it has nothing.

1505
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:54,300
It, it still has to be a completely other design problem that we're

1506
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,800
going to work on, right?

1507
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,600
And so as I went,

1508
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,000
You notice that I kept adding new things to the system, like I added

1509
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,900
that floating familiar.

1510
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,100
That was a step towards adding Ai and game rules.

1511
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,400
We started adding the sword.

1512
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,900
That's exactly what I was doing.

1513
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,200
But I'm constantly looking at all of the pieces that are in play there

1514
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,200
and going.

1515
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,000
Oh, okay.

1516
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,400
I see.

1517
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,900
We've already gotten to the point, even with just these things in

1518
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,800
there, where it's becoming difficult, to work on the code because of

1519
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,300
the complexity that's involved with maintaining the high and low

1520
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,500
frequency and the positional stuff and

1521
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,000
No, I need those things.

1522
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,600
So it's kind of like now is a good point if you can think of a way to

1523
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,400
do it to level those things up to a better architecture, right?

1524
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,700
And I was reluctant to do that for a while because I haven't thought

1525
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,700
of anything that was a clear win.

1526
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,300
But now after we got enough out there I was like I see what the clear

1527
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:49,600
winner is.

1528
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,000
Now, let's do it.

1529
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,100
And so I think this is the right thing and that's why I did it now.

1530
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,200
Instead of doing it before again, I didn't think about it clearly

1531
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,700
enough before.

1532
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,600
So if I done something like this before, it would have been a bad

1533
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,100
idea.

1534
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,400
And it's hard to say.

1535
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,000
When you get those ideas in your head, what they should be or

1536
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:05,600
shouldn't be.

1537
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,200
That's kind of the, a little bit of experience talking.

1538
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,900
Knowing when you get an idea that you're like, ah, this one really

1539
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,900
does solve a bunch of problems that I've been having.

1540
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,700
I've seen all the problems I think, you know, this is a good one to go

1541
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,300
with Now versus going.

1542
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,900
I don't think I quite have enough information yet, right?

1543
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:29,000
Making those judgments calls is obviously that takes a lot of practice

1544
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
to know about.

1545
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,900
How will we update low frequency regions?

1546
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,800
Given the sparse nature of the world?

1547
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,400
Probably will just spin through tile.

1548
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,200
Chunks will be my guest.

1549
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,800
We'll just go through the hash table.

1550
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,500
Maybe we'll string will go through the, the hash table and pick out

1551
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,300
tile chunks.

1552
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,300
Look for tile chunks, that haven't been updated in a.

1553
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,100
While update around them which will pull in any Tau chunks that are

1554
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,700
nearby.

1555
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:59,200
They'll do the update Mark, all those toxins updated and keep going.

1556
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,700
Is there a major advantage to using for is instead of Wiles?

1557
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,100
No for loops?

1558
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:12,700
And while Loops are exactly the same, in terms of code that gets

1559
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,300
generated, they're just notational.

1560
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:19,800
So basically like if you want to anytime you see a for Loop, you could

1561
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,800
just write it as a while loop, right?

1562
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,800
So like that's the while loop version of this for Loop and so there's

1563
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:33,600
really no difference of them.

1564
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,300
It's just the reason that people prefer for Loops often times.

1565
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,200
And the reason that I myself right for Loops when I write them, it's

1566
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,700
because it shows more clearly when you're reading what the elements of

1567
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,100
the loop, are it just, it, kind of bundles, them were nicely together

1568
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:51,500
in a while loop that kind of spread out, especially when there's a

1569
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,400
bunch of stuff here, right?

1570
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,500
You start to lose track of what the blue parts are or if things get

1571
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:57,800
inserted.

1572
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,300
Add in here, right?

1573
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:02,700
So the for Loop is just a nice way to kind of bundle those things

1574
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:03,200
together.

1575
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,600
What will the entities that are not visible on the screen be doing?

1576
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,100
I can't really think of examples of things that need to be updated if

1577
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,300
they're far from the player.

1578
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,200
So, an example would be,

1579
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:26,700
and again, until we actually get to the game are specific, game will

1580
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,900
have specific needs but giving an example from like, if you imagine

1581
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,900
just a random game, the sorts of stuff that I think would be nice to

1582
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:39,700
be able to do any time we want is let's say that the player you know,

1583
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:40,800
goes ahead and

1584
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:48,600
Excuse me, goes ahead and, you know, Toxin and PC and the NBC says,

1585
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,400
oh, okay, you know, I'll go fetch that thing.

1586
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,200
I would like the MPC to then be able to like go and walk somewhere

1587
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,000
else in the world, no matter what you're doing, fetch the thing, and

1588
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,900
like bring it back.

1589
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,900
And then he's there again, right?

1590
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,400
And maybe he goes there, and he looks for it, but it's not there.

1591
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,100
So he then goes and look somewhere else for it.

1592
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,200
And if you were like, walking around and went up somewhere, you might

1593
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,400
Him like walk by like, you're on a screen in the MVC, comes on the

1594
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,300
bottom and walks by and walks off the top.

1595
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,700
If you like, hey, I know that guy.

1596
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,300
Where's he going?

1597
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,100
And you could follow him.

1598
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,500
I just want to enable stuff like that.

1599
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,000
I know games don't do it very often but I think they'd be cooler if

1600
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,700
they did, it's just kind of a nice emergent Behavior thing.

1601
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,400
And so since it's a it's an interesting programming challenge.

1602
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:35,200
I decided to include it in our engine because I think it's worth us

1603
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:36,400
figuring these things out.

1604
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,900
It's part of the teaching process of showing how to work.

1605
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,300
Through programming problems, that are difficult.

1606
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,200
If we just wanted to make

1607
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,600
Make a game where we just had a simple to, you know, if we were just

1608
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,000
going to clone Binding of Isaac or something, there's it's really easy

1609
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,800
to program, right?

1610
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,600
There's one room.

1611
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,600
Nothing happens anywhere in the game of the worlds are tiny, there's

1612
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,900
like five enemies on the screen, right?

1613
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,800
We could trivially right that we've already written most of the code

1614
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,300
that you would need, right?

1615
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,500
So the idea is not to show how to program the simplest game possible

1616
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,900
because I don't think that's very interesting.

1617
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,500
The idea is to show how to program a game whose game design is vastly

1618
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,500
more complicated than 90% or even.

1619
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,100
That on the games that you might see.

1620
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,500
So, you can actually see how to work through very difficult

1621
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:19,600
architecture problems.

1622
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:24,800
Not just, hey, I've got a simple platform or something because that's

1623
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,100
just not that interesting.

1624
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:26,700
I don't think.

1625
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,500
How many low entities does it take to screw in a light bulb?

1626
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,500
Well, now if you actually are talking about just stored entities, that

1627
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,700
are not mapped into the simulation set, there is no number of them

1628
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,900
that could screw in a light bulb because they don't get a Time step.

1629
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,000
It's only once they are Sim.

1630
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
So if you're talking about if you include the fact that there's the

1631
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,700
low-frequency simulation thing going around simulating them then you

1632
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,300
know I suppose it depends on

1633
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,400
The update entity called for that particular type of entity and how

1634
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:07,400
many you know hitpoints the lightbulb has that sort of stuff.

1635
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,800
Your voice is about to throw in the towel.

1636
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,200
Be careful.

1637
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,000
We need your tumor.

1638
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:15,600
It's true.

1639
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,000
My voice is tomorrow.

1640
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,100
Stream may be a silent stream where you just watch me rearrange.

1641
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:22,500
The last remaining pieces of code and compile.

1642
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:22,900
This

1643
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,700
first far storage.

1644
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,800
Why not store the XYZ cords?

1645
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:35,200
Bit shifted into aniline integer to use it as a composite key into a

1646
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:39,900
dictionary or hash map so we are.

1647
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,500
We're basically already doing that.

1648
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,300
The only thing we don't do well.

1649
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:50,100
I mean I'll just go ahead and load it up.

1650
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,600
So, here you go.

1651
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,500
Where's Mike?

1652
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,500
Where's my get chunk?

1653
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,100
It's in here somewhere.

1654
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,100
There is get World chunk.

1655
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,500
So if you notice, that's exactly what we do.

1656
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:10,500
Right?

1657
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,600
There's the hash lat, there's the positions.

1658
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,800
So like what you're saying is exactly what we do.

1659
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,600
If you're asking literally, why we don't pitch shift, it's because

1660
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,200
Well, there's to do better hash function, so we haven't analyzed it,

1661
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,300
but oftentimes just packing the bits together isn't the best way to

1662
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,800
throw things into a hash table.

1663
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,600
So we're actually multiplying by primes, not that, that's particularly

1664
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,100
better.

1665
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,300
We actually want to analyze these in have some real Prime sir.

1666
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:44,000
This was this is garbage, but bit shifting is probably not what we'll

1667
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,200
want to do because we want to do something probably that that tries to

1668
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,400
look at how our world Jen tends to generate worlds, and make something

1669
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,600
that that is going to use the

1670
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:54,500
Able well, for those kinds of layouts.

1671
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,800
Do you approach design a similar way to your architecture?

1672
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,500
I expression based design design sort of merges itself.

1673
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,300
We're going to excetera.

1674
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,200
So if you're talking about game design, I'm not a game designer, so I

1675
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:13,600
can't really comment on that.

1676
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,800
I, I don't do game design.

1677
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,300
I just do game programming.

1678
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,300
It's multi-threading in the scope of topics for the project.

1679
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,000
It's sort of wasn't.

1680
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,700
I mean it was for the renderer, the software renderer because that was

1681
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:37,800
a good place like a do it, that would make sense, but it wasn't

1682
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,200
originally because the Raspberry Pi only had one core and I wanted to

1683
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,700
port to that eventually probably.

1684
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,200
And so, since that's also our slowest platform, being multi-threaded

1685
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:52,000
didn't seem like much of a good idea but all that changed in a big way

1686
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,100
because recently, they announced that

1687
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:58,800
Raspberry Pi is getting a refresh and it's going to have an arm cortex

1688
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,400
core.

1689
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:02,300
Arm cortex chip with 4 cores.

1690
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,700
So now multi-threading is absolutely on the table and updating

1691
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:10,600
multiple SIM regions in parallel is absolutely something that we will

1692
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,400
probably want to do when the time comes.

1693
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:23,500
If a Faraway room gets updated and the rooms around that are updated

1694
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,100
to don't, we have this recursive problem where the around rooms need

1695
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,800
their neighbor to know again, because you can do simulations half

1696
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,700
cited, right?

1697
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:38,500
We can do, like, just move the entities here in this region, do those

1698
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,400
moves, right?

1699
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,500
And the things nearby them aren't allowed to move.

1700
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,700
We can do stuff like that, right?

1701
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:50,300
And we do introduce problems like If This Were, if this were some kind

1702
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:50,300
of

1703
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,500
A multiplayer online game that we're working this way, it would

1704
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,600
probably be a bad idea because you really care about things like

1705
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,100
fairness there and all these other sorts of things.

1706
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,300
But we have the ability to sort of tweak, you know, all the things

1707
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:07,100
that are getting updated out there completely under our control and we

1708
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,500
have the ability to tweak, their a eyes and change the way they're a

1709
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,300
eyes work to make it.

1710
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,500
So that that's not really going to cause a lot of huge problems.

1711
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,600
If we see it causing problems, we can probably fix them.

1712
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,600
So I don't think we're going to have a problem with that aspect of it.

1713
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,300
But we'll see, you know, we never really know.

1714
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,800
How much work would it take to turn the game?

1715
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,400
The game you're making from a 2d world into a 3D World?

1716
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,400
I'm not sure how to answer that question.

1717
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,900
Because it's very ambiguous, are you talking about rewriting the

1718
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,500
crytek engine or you talking about literally you just want the things

1719
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,300
to be you know 3D models you loaded out of Maya but its exact same

1720
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,100
game, otherwise?

1721
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,000
Right?

1722
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,400
Because there's a huge difference between those two things.

1723
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,200
To clarify my early design question.

1724
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:13,000
I just mean, as far as your design decisions for handmade hero.

1725
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:18,400
Well, so far, I haven't really done exploratory design with handmade

1726
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,600
here because I mostly did it just sort of on paper because I haven't

1727
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,500
obviously been doing any of the zine on stream.

1728
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,000
So I can't really do emergent design in that sense.

1729
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,700
When we actually do Implement, all the game stuff that I sort of

1730
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,600
already wrote down that, I thought we should do once we get all that

1731
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,000
working.

1732
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,100
Then yeah, we probably will do fairly

1733
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,100
Lee organic design that way.

1734
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,600
Because like I said, I'm not a game designer so I don't have really

1735
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,300
strong opinions about that necessarily so we probably will do stuff.

1736
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,300
It's like, well, I'm on stream and I like oh, we implement this

1737
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:47,500
feature.

1738
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,100
It also be cool if you did this, we'll just do that.

1739
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,000
And so there probably will be a fair bit of design.

1740
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:57,600
That's very emergent there because, you know, again, the focus of this

1741
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,700
product is on programming, not design, and

1742
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,200
As we think of fun things to implement, we should just Implement them

1743
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,500
and see how to program them.

1744
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:06,900
That would be my preference.

1745
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,900
All right, I think we're almost out of time.

1746
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,700
We are almost out of time, it ends at 10.

1747
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:15,800
It looks like we don't have any more questions.

1748
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:21,700
So we're right on time we are right on time people so that's pretty

1749
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,200
good.

1750
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,800
That's pretty good.

1751
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:32,800
I would say in my in my humbleness oddly that humble opinion.

1752
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,400
All right.

1753
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,900
Well, I guess since we're at the end of questions now is a good time

1754
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:39,800
to wrap up the stream.

1755
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,500
That's very good.

1756
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:42,800
We're right on time.

1757
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:45,200
And I'm pretty excited about where we're at.

1758
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,100
I think this is going to help us out a lot.

1759
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,900
I like this design decision.

1760
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:49,900
It's looking pretty good.

1761
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,700
So far, you know what I should do?

1762
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,400
I should save this out so it'll get shipped out now.

1763
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,100
It's black.

1764
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,600
It's the Blackboard art file in the Mist directory.

1765
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,100
So that when I upload things, in case, anyone wants to look at the

1766
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,900
diagrams, but I think that is

1767
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,900
For today.

1768
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,900
So thank you everyone for joining me.

1769
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,300
It's been a pleasure program with you, and I was very happy to put

1770
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,000
that stuff in today.

1771
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,800
I think tomorrow is going to be great when we wrap it up and we can

1772
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:17,800
kind of sort of started focusing on the low high anything, because now

1773
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,600
that I actually feel really good about that same region stuff.

1774
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,600
It gives me those really well-defined places to do the map in and out.

1775
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,400
And I've kind of been waiting for the right time to start thinking

1776
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,800
about that map in and out.

1777
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,500
And so now that will sort of material as I think over the next week.

1778
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:33,900
So we're probably

1779
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,100
I want to do is over the next week or so.

1780
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,100
So, next week,

1781
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,700
Probably all next week.

1782
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,200
Throw a ton of stuff in that low entity like whatever we can fit do

1783
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:48,400
finish, the hit point stuff and I don't know what else in there, but

1784
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,700
just whatever we can think of pickups.

1785
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,700
Like maybe you can go walk around and get different swords to throw.

1786
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,000
And I don't even know chest.

1787
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,900
You can open that kind of stuff just pile, a bunch of stuff in there.

1788
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,000
So that we really bloat out that low entity class huge right.

1789
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,700
And then take a

1790
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,800
That and go.

1791
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:16,200
Okay, how can we now start to think about how we want to deal with

1792
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:16,700
these?

1793
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:20,100
Where we know we're going to have tons and tons of these guys tons and

1794
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,000
tons of these things.

1795
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,600
How do we start managing that and sort of, in the same vein, I'd like

1796
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,600
to get the property transfer and stuff in there.

1797
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,100
I talked about that something where, you know, things touch other

1798
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,900
things and they pick up properties from them or, you know, you cast a

1799
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:35,200
spell on one thing and that thing keeps that state.

1800
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,000
And so that when it does something later in abused, that something

1801
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,700
else, I

1802
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,100
To kind of get the cram those things in there so I can start to see

1803
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,500
how they feel because that's the next thing that I want to nail down.

1804
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,300
Any system wise, I think that's going to be really important.

1805
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,700
So, I want to push towards that.

1806
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:54,500
I don't know if we'll make it before, break people have been asking

1807
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,800
for a week off, for quite some time and so that first week in March,

1808
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,100
Said, we could take off because I'm going to be away anyway, I'm going

1809
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,700
to be visiting my parents so it's easy for me to just go.

1810
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:09,200
Okay, we won't stream while I'm away.

1811
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,400
So people have that week to catch up.

1812
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,300
So we've got two weeks.

1813
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,800
I don't know if we'll get all the way there, hopefully next week and

1814
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,900
then the week after week and if you just keep piling stuff in there,

1815
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,700
I'm hoping that we'll be able to kind of get to a point where I'm

1816
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:23,600
comfortable saying, there's enough things in here that we can start to

1817
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,300
make decisions.

1818
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,100
Don't know if we will or not but I'd like to do that if we get there

1819
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:27,600
before I break.

1820
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,800
That would be pretty cool because then we'll have that hole.

1821
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,800
Break to think about it, and we come back, we could do the energy

1822
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,000
system that would be pretty cool.

1823
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:35,700
So we'll see.

1824
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,900
Mmm, that's where we're at again.

1825
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,800
Thank you so much for joining me.

1826
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,400
I will be back here tomorrow night 8:00 p.m.

1827
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,300
6 Center time, I guess.

1828
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,200
Yeah, tonight was a late start because we wanted to watch John,

1829
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,800
obviously, any time, John is streaming updates to his programming

1830
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:52,100
language.

1831
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:52,800
I want to watch that.

1832
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,200
So we always delayed the stream and that's on but tomorrow night

1833
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,000
there's there's no other things going on.

1834
01:27:59,000 --> 01:27:59,800
As far as I know, so it

1835
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,200
60 time tomorrow, right?

1836
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,700
Back here on Twitch, if you would like, to follow along with the

1837
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,500
source code at home, you can do.

1838
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,300
So right here.

1839
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,500
Basically, if you preorder the game, you can download the source.

1840
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,000
Code we posted every night after I'm done programming.

1841
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,800
And of course, you can go check out the video archive.

1842
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,000
There's videos all the way back to day.

1843
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,200
One which tell you exactly how to set up a build machine, how to work

1844
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:22,800
with the source code.

1845
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,700
It shows you every step of the way, how I built it.

1846
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:26,800
So you can go through every last thing.

1847
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And see how it was made.

1848
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,700
So that's pretty cool.

1849
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,000
And you can do that here on handmade here.

1850
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,100
At org we also have a patreon.

1851
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,400
If you want to support the video series, you can always subscribe to

1852
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:36,900
that.

1853
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,500
And there's a news and Forum site, you can check out which has a bunch

1854
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,400
of stuff like the schedule for the week.

1855
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,000
The schedule, freaks also tweeted by the tweetbot if you want to have

1856
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,400
them delivered right to your Twitter account, you can do that here on

1857
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:51,600
the tweets button, but the news report says that it's got a discussion

1858
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,400
board, it's got old episodes annotated.

1859
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:57,100
You can go in the episode guide, It's got ports to Mac and Linux got

1860
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:57,400
all kinds.
