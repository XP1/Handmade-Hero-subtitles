Recording.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,300
Start recording.

00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Minimize.

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,100
Hello everyone and welcome to a very sleepy Edition handmade hero.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,900
I did try to go to bed early last night, it did not work.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,600
I was able to have a midnight snack of cheese and almonds which is

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,200
tasty.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,900
But that means that I am bleary-eyed.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,000
I did have some coffee and we've been chatting for about 20 minutes

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,400
that we should have been programming for here, as I attempt to wake

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:31,600
up.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,800
And hopefully, now we are at the point where we could actually do some

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,600
reasonable coding, but there's really only one way to find out and

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
that is to try to do some reasonable coating.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,200
So, welcome to handmade hero.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,500
The show where we code a complete game from scratch live on Twitch

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,200
with no engine and no Library, even

18
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,100
And when we are falling asleep, ladies and gentlemen, that is our

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,900
commitment as the handmade hero team.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,800
That is our commitment to you.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,800
So if you want to follow along today and you are not as sleepy today

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,700
is day 83.

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,000
So unpack the source code for day 82 and that is what I am starting

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,200
with.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,800
And if you want to follow along, that's when you should start with

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,100
two.

27
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,700
Now, we left off yesterday with a little to do that.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,400
I said, I didn't have time to go over and so, you know what, we kind

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,900
of need to go over that right?

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Don't know if you guys remember also, it is high allergy season here.

31
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,400
So the amount of times I'll blow my nose in the Stream is going to

32
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
Staggering, that's just something you should be aware of.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,300
So that is going to be like continual currents.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,600
I know it's delicious.

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,800
Anyway, so, what I was talking about yesterday, we, well, you know,

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,900
for those of you who might have missed it, what we did is we made it

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,000
so that we could cash bitmaps and then use them, I realized we have a

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,100
ton of little heads.

39
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,300
I don't know why I left all those heads in there they're just kind of

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,600
little familiar sort of floating around, hi their familiars but anyway

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,500
that bitmap in the background there what we basically did is we made

42
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,600
it so that we could do caching of bitmaps

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
On the, you know, on the fly.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So we could basically anything that we could have drawn to the screen

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,900
we can now draw into a bitmap and so that's like a bunch of stamps

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,800
that we put together to make a ground texture and it was really slow

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
to do that because we don't have fast rendering routines yet.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,700
We haven't written any.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,500
We just have a really simple bitmap copied routine which is not

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,500
optimized at all and so that was really slow and tanked.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,800
Our favorite songs like well, we could just cast the results of it and

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
then draw and that's what we did.

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,100
And there it is, right.

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,200
But

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Haven't talked about what to do with the alpha yet, right?

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,200
And so I kind of wanted to take a second to just talk about what that

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,500
means, so that we can kind of see you know, what's going on here.

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
So let's do that.

59
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Let's see.

60
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,100
If I can for some reason and I don't know, the reason my pain does not

61
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,900
seem to be working.

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,400
Why does my pain not seem to be working?

63
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
See here, pain, there it goes.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
You know, USB just unplug it and plug it back in.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Alright, so day 83, there we go.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,500
So

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,700
You know what?

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
It's not really working, it's actually going through Mouse emulation,

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,900
isn't it?

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Seriously people, is that where we're at?

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,800
All right.

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, you know what?

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,100
Let's close mischief and we'll see.

74
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,100
You've got that little weird thing showing up.

75
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
You gotta love Microsoft Windows people.

76
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,500
You gotta love that, that sort of stability.

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,200
It's getting more Linux see every day.

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, this is totally untrackable.

79
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,400
Why have you ruined the handmade here?

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,300
A Blackboard.

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,700
Why can we ask that question?

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
Why would you do that to us?

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,400
I don't know.

84
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,500
Well, we're not off to a good start and I'm sleepy already.

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,399
You'd think they could, you know, cut me some slack here.

86
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,200
Yeah, so it's totally messed up.

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, I don't know what to do about that.

88
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,100
I guess we'll have to take a second to actually try to figure out

89
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,000
what's going on.

90
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,700
I have no idea why it would just suddenly stopped working other than

91
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,000
that's the sort of thing that happens with computers these days, even

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
though nothing has changed.

93
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, shouldn't we have?

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,700
Like a Wacom driver thing in here?

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,200
Yeah.

96
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,800
So the tablet driver was not.

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,300
So let's take a quick, a brief moment and just point out, this is what

98
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,200
I talked about, you know, we've said this multiple times on the stream

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,100
where I'm just, like, what is going on with Computing these days

100
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,300
nothing has happened on this computer.

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,800
It is exactly the same as when we left it yesterday, like nothing

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,400
happened.

103
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,100
So how do people manage to engineer software so bad that when nothing

104
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,900
has changed?

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,200
All of a sudden you just a driver is gone, right?

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
It's just, it's, it's ridiculous.

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,400
And the quality level just keeps going down and down and down, it's

108
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,000
awful.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,100
So yeah.

110
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,300
All right, this is going to be the worst drawing ever.

111
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,900
I'll try to do it as well as I can, but it's super hard to control

112
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,000
because it's not actually reading the

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,500
Tablets, treating you like a mouse.

114
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
So it's all ugly.

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,100
I'll do the best I can and then I guess, will someone please remind me

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,800
at the end or send an email maybe to remind me to try and get this

117
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:59,000
machine to re recognize the tablet that it was recognizing just just

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,600
the other day.

119
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,800
so,

120
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,700
If we take a look at what was happening before, right, we wrote some

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,300
code where we basically, you know, we have our drawbitmap, this is

122
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,800
drawbitmap here, right?

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
We have drawbitmap call.

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,400
And what that does is it takes a bitmap that has sort of.

125
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,700
It has an alpha channel in it, right?

126
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,900
Which is like a mask or were using it like a mask to tell us where the

127
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
bitmap has data.

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
We actually care about in

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,700
It doesn't.

130
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,200
And the reason for that is because we don't want everything to be

131
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,300
square, right?

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,700
We want to have things that have shapes in them and when we draw them

133
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,800
to the screen, right, if there was stuff underneath, you know, if

134
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,300
there was some stuff here on the screen already, we only want to put

135
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,800
this image right where it actually should go.

136
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,600
We don't want to overwrite like we don't want to see, you know, you

137
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,500
can imagine

138
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,100
If we were to add not use the alpha Channel, there'd be like a square

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,100
of emptiness.

140
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,400
That would follow this thing that we put in there, right?

141
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
And we don't want that, we want it to cleanly.

142
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
Come to composite those edges, right?

143
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,700
And that's why we need that Alpha.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,400
So, that was working fine.

145
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,900
We got that working and the way that we did that again, is using our

146
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,400
linear interpolation, right again.

147
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,300
Like I said, most important equation in game development basically

148
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
using linear interpolation.

149
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,900
What we did is we said all right, we have an alpha channel, right?

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,900
The alpha channel is encoded as a bite.

151
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,000
It goes from 0 to 255 and that 0 to 255.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,900
Number tells us how mask the area is

153
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,100
Zero means don't show what's here at all.

154
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,800
So that's like this area 255 means full show.

155
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,900
Like, that's the, the complete opaqueness.

156
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,000
And then in between are like gradations of blending and that allows to

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,500
have anti-aliased edges or like sort of transparent like, partially

158
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
transparent things, right?

159
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,900
So we can, we can do some transparent effects are to.

160
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,200
We haven't really taken advantage of that but we could use it, right?

161
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,900
And so that all works, just fine because we basically export things in

162
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,800
out of out of GIMP that have that or out of Photoshop or whatever.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,700
And, you know, we, we use those bitmaps a composite to the screen.

164
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,000
But what we wanted to do yesterday, was basically have a two-step

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,300
process, right?

166
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,500
Instead of drawing that maps to the screen, and just drawing bitmaps,

167
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,000
the screen drawing them, drawing and drawing them.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,799
What we wanted to do was take a bunch of bitmaps, so, same scenario,

169
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,200
right?

170
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,100
Like so we want to take a bunch of bitmaps and instead of drawing to

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,800
the screen we wanted to do it to like an intermediate buffer, right?

172
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,000
So we want to draw this to some other buffer here and then eventually

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,900
later draw it to the screen and the reason we did that is

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
We could save the work.

175
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,400
So if we did like, you know, let's say there's a hundred X of these

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,600
sort of Blitzen to here.

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,100
We wanted to save that work and then use it again later, right?

178
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,200
But what that means is, we have to be able to produce an alpha channel

179
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,400
for this intermediate buffer, right?

180
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,800
So this had Alpha that came from Photoshop or some other place, right?

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,100
This doesn't need Alpha, right?

182
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
This doesn't have to have Alpha at all because it's just getting

183
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,900
displayed on the

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Screen.

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
It's not getting compositing outs and the alpha doesn't need the alpha

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,500
is, wouldn't isn't used by Windows to do anything.

187
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,400
We don't need Windows, doesn't need to know our Alpha Channel just

188
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,100
needs to know the color channels, right?

189
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
But this right here, where does this come from, right?

190
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,500
How do we get Alpha here?

191
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,300
And so, we just want to take a quick second to think about what we

192
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,600
need that Alpha to be.

193
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,900
So we can make sure that we fill it in, right?

194
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,000
And that's kind of where we left it yesterday, right?

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because we got everything working but we hadn't really figured out

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,300
what we want to do with the alpha Channel.

197
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,800
And so I'm just going to say a few things about it and then we're

198
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
going to see what it should end up being based on that and try it

199
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,900
right.

200
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,200
So I guess what I would say is we can have

201
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,000
Um, pretty straightforward things that we would want to have happen.

202
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,500
The example would be I'm going to use the numbers 0 to 1 since that's

203
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,400
how we actually translated the alpha in there before because basically

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,200
we had, you know, the real value of this is 0 to 1 and we're just

205
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,300
encoding that in b as 0 to 255, right.

206
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,300
So this isn't this is in, you know, this is this is an integers and

207
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,000
this isn't floats basically or reels, right?

208
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,700
So if we're talking about the zero to one thing where zero is

209
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,400
completely transparent and one is completely opaque, and everything in

210
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,800
between, is some, some gradation thereof and were encoding at 0 to

211
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,500
255.

212
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,000
If we need to think about that, whatever comes in and whatever is

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,900
already in the buffer, is what we're working with right for any given

214
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,600
pixel.

215
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,900
When something is getting drawn in here, we've got two things.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,700
We've got the source Alpha, right?

217
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,400
Which I guess we could call Source Alpha and we've got the destination

218
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Alpha, right?

219
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,100
That's the thing that's already in the buffer, right?

220
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,600
So the destination Alpha

221
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,100
Now we know that when we start out, we want all of the destination

222
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,300
Alpha to start at 0, right?

223
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,300
Because if we have this buffer and nobody do anything into it, we

224
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,800
would want it to be completely transparent everywhere because that

225
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,300
means there's nothing in the buffer.

226
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
So if we were to bleed it to the screen later, we would want to see

227
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,000
nothing should not affect anything at all right.

228
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,600
So we know that the destination Alpha defaults to zero so what we can

229
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,000
say then is on that first blind that comes in the first thing that

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,400
comes in if you just did one bitmap and pleaded that to the buffer,

231
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
then Blended the buffer to the screen.

232
00:11:59,800 --> 00:11:59,800
You

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I want it to be exactly the same as bleeding.

234
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,200
What, what was in that initial bitmap directly to the screen?

235
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,400
Right?

236
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,700
We don't want it to modify at all when it comes through here.

237
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
So, basically, like the first time, we could easily say that we just

238
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
want the destination Alpha to be equal to the source Alpha, right?

239
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,900
So that's kind of a requirement that we would have for this is that if

240
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,800
you just bladed, one thing you want them to be equal.

241
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay, so then what we really need to talk about is what happens the

242
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,700
second time, you know, and subsequently after that man it's hard to

243
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,000
draw with this with no pain driver.

244
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,900
So if we want to talk about what happens the second time then, really

245
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,200
what we're talking about is what happens.

246
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,300
When destination Alpha has some nonzero value in it.

247
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,700
Right?

248
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
Because we know here destination Alpha is always zero at the

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,300
beginning.

250
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,400
So it's just basically a copy through there, right?

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,400
So the second time through

252
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,700
And maybe I should write this slightly differently.

253
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Like maybe I should say that.

254
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,700
Actually this is you know that

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,700
assigned destination Alpha from Source Alpha.

256
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,600
So the second time through what we want to have happen is if they're

257
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,400
obviously was a zero in there.

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,700
So you know we could say if there was a zero in there then we want it

259
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,400
to do exactly what it was doing before.

260
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,000
So anywhere that hasn't been touched it should still operate exactly

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,500
as the first time right because the pixels shouldn't, you know, each

262
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,300
individual pixels, kind of like its own buffer in some sense.

263
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,500
So if there's a zero in there it should be operating the same as it

264
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:32,600
was.

265
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,600
First time now if there is a 1.

266
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,900
So if Source Alpha equaled one, right then we also know no matter what

267
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,500
happens.

268
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
The destination Alpha should also equal 1, right?

269
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
Because if I'm taking something totally opaque and putting it over the

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
top of things I want to have that result be totally opaque as well,

271
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,900
right?

272
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Similarly, if sauce Alpha was Zero, we would want destination Alpha to

273
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,700
be whatever it was before, right?

274
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,700
If the source Alpha is not, if there's nothing in the source image at

275
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,600
that point, we don't want to modify whatever was in the destination

276
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:11,800
at.

277
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,600
All right?

278
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,700
So at the source Alpha is totally opaque.

279
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
It should just overwrite it.

280
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,700
If it's totally transparent, it should ignore it.

281
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,200
So now all we really need to think about is, what happens.

282
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,400
You know, that's pretty clear when we really need to think about is

283
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,000
what would happen when there's other values in here, right?

284
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,200
And so, you know, it's kind of hard to

285
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,100
it's kind of hard to conceptualize because it's not clear.

286
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,500
Really what the operation equates to if that makes sense.

287
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,700
So let's say we had two things.

288
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,800
So let's say we had sa equals 0.5 and destination.

289
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,300
Alpha equals 0.5

290
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Right.

291
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,900
So this is a half transparent thing that we do.

292
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,500
In there.

293
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,300
And now we've got a half transparent thing that were drawing on top of

294
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,400
it, right?

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,400
What should the destination Alpha be there, right?

296
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Should the destination Alpha be half again, right?

297
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
Should it be?

298
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,200
Oops, man, groans.

299
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
His pain is hard.

300
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,800
In other words, should the destination Alpha be point five because

301
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
that's you know what was drawn on here?

302
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,400
Should this kind of work at whatever the remainder is of here.

303
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,100
So if we had point five and we drew point five on it, should that

304
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,500
actually give us another half again.

305
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,100
So should destination Alpha become .75, right.

306
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,000
Meaning that like

307
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,100
Let's say here is 1 and 0 and we're saying that this is the level

308
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
that's currently in there, right?

309
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,100
.5.

310
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,600
Should the remaining range be what's used with the, you know, with

311
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,900
what's coming in so that we're going .5 of the way up to up to Transit

312
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
transparent, right?

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
And so, you know, would we would we want this to basically produce

314
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
that value right?

315
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,700
Going halfway there.

316
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
It's almost impossible to draw with this thing.

317
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,300
This is awful.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,500
Windows, I hate you.

319
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,700
You make my life miserable.

320
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
All right, so

321
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,300
Windows is like the allergies of computing.

322
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,100
But you can live with it, but it makes you unhappy every day.

323
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
Alright, so

324
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,000
Let's see.

325
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,700
So you know which of those to do we want to do and unfortunately like

326
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
you know even thinking about it.

327
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,600
Now I can't think of a really important motivating case here, to

328
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
really even know what we would do.

329
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,200
So I'm going to look at it from the standpoint of the things that we

330
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,900
actually have working now, which is, you know, what we're actually

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,500
using the alpha 4 and that is for edges, right?

332
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
We're trying to Alpha blend our edges,

333
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,500
The edges smooth.

334
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,200
And so the way that we're really looking at Alpha is essentially as if

335
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,000
it was coverage in some sense, right?

336
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,500
We're really kind of looking at it mostly a saying if there was a

337
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,700
pixel and an edge was passing through that pixel, we are setting the

338
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,600
alpha value to be, you know, whatever that

339
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Whatever that portion is there, right?

340
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,100
So, like if it covered .5 of the pixel, the alpha should be point

341
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,200
five, that's sort of how we were looking at it because we're not

342
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,600
actually using it for transparency anywhere, we're just using it for

343
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,100
edges.

344
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,800
So, when Photoshop, when the, you know, you paint as a, you know,

345
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,500
paint brush through there, that's what it's doing.

346
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,100
So you get into this, this kind of problem where you say, well, okay,

347
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,900
if it's coverage, what we really would like to know is what part of

348
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Pixel was covered, right?

349
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,600
Because you can imagine two scenarios.

350
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,700
Let's say I had one bitmap that covered that part of the pixel and

351
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,700
another bitmap that covered that part of the pixel, right?

352
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,900
And if this is point 3 and this is point three coverage then clearly

353
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,400
when those two things do on top of each other, you would want that

354
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,600
pixel to become .6 because they're both covering different parts of

355
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,200
the pixel.

356
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,500
So you want to produce essentially that amount of coverage right?

357
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,000
But you could imagine another scenario where one thing was covering

358
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,100
this much, and that's point three.

359
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,900
And another thing was covered,

360
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
During almost exactly the same part, right?

361
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,700
.3.

362
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,200
And in this case, the coverage, when you composite them you know, is

363
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,000
going to be actually redundant and so it's actually going to be

364
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,600
something like more like .5 or 0.3 still you know because maybe this

365
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,500
covered everything that this covered and so on, right?

366
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:55,100
So this is this problem is why you end up with things like multi

367
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,800
sampling, right?

368
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,600
In Hardware that tries to do stuff like okay we actually take many

369
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
samples per pixel so that we

370
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
Kind of tell where the coverage actually was instead of reducing it

371
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
down to a single number, but we're not going to go that far because

372
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
that has a lot of extra implications.

373
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
So that's in terms of performance memory footprint, all these sorts of

374
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,800
things that we can't afford.

375
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,500
So what we're going to do is say all right, let's just pretend for

376
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,300
sake of our compositor.

377
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,900
That what we want to do is let's just assume that the coverage is

378
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,000
non-overlapping.

379
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,500
So let's just say that the two coverage is were the same, we're the

380
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:32,900
same

381
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,400
And or rather, let's let's how should I put this?

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,900
Chinese activate.

383
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's assume that we are not trying to compute some absolute coverage,

384
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,300
actual real coverage result that would require us to do multi

385
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:53,800
sampling.

386
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,300
And let's just do something that will allow us to produce reasonable

387
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,800
coverage in some other way, right?

388
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,900
So the first problem we might have is if we just add them together,

389
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,900
right?

390
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,300
We would end up in a situation where we would overflow

391
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,800
Right.

392
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,100
So let's say we have two things that each cover the whole pixel,

393
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,800
right?

394
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,700
We add those two together and this is one, this is one, we would end

395
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,000
up with two right now, that's not necessarily a problem because we

396
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
could just clamp the value from 0 to 1.

397
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,700
So we could allow it to overflow and that would be like this model,

398
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,600
right?

399
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,400
That would just be saying all of the coverage is assumed to be

400
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,700
separate and so we're just going to go ahead.

401
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,100
And add them in clamp, right?

402
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,300
So we could try that and we can maybe try that, and see what happens,

403
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,500
right?

404
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
So that's add and clamp

405
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,600
Right for Destination output.

406
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,900
The other thing we could do is this method right here, which sort of

407
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,300
is the same.

408
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,200
It's saying, let's assume that the coverage value is talking about

409
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,100
covering the part that hasn't been covered yet, right?

410
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
And so if we wanted to do that, what we would do?

411
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,100
Is say, well, alright, we've got one - we want to know what's the

412
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,000
leftover, right?

413
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,300
We want to produce this region, right?

414
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,400
So you want to do one - the destination Alpha, right?

415
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,600
Which is saying how much do we have left?

416
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,700
And then we want to multiply that by the source output, to figure out

417
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,100
how much of it we're going to use.

418
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,500
That's the part that the source Alpha contributes.

419
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,300
And then, we add that to whatever the existing destination Alpha is.

420
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:27,900
Right.

421
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,400
That's exactly this case here.

422
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,200
This was the destination Alpha.

423
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,900
So this is one minus the destination Alpha this region up here.

424
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,600
And then, we're just taking however, far, we should go in that region

425
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,200
and adding it back to the, to the bottom, right?

426
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,000
And that seems maybe a little better to me because, I mean, I have to

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,800
do the clamping.

428
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,800
So it's kind of like a more consistent thing, so I'd like to try that

429
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,300
one as well.

430
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
If you multiply that out right, what you get is.

431
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:01,000
- right, I'm just doing the distribution here sa da plus d a.

432
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:11,300
So the other way we could have raised this is sa + 1 - excuse me.

433
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,700
Sorry.

434
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Do you hear?

435
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
I'm just pulling this D @d.

436
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,700
A out, 1 minus s a DA, right?

437
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
So there's two ways we can actually phrase.

438
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,500
It, we can phrase it in terms of collapsing, the da term and using one

439
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,100
- The Source Alpha and we could phrase it in the other way which is

440
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,200
doing 1 - d a on the source author, right?

441
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,900
So we can we can sort of pick who is the one who's being inverted.

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,100
Make sure I do that, right?

443
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,200
I'm pretty sleepy this morning.

444
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,200
Sa - sa da plus d.

445
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
A, that's good essay.

446
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,800
And so we're pulling this out here and that's, yeah, that's one - sh

447
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,300
that's fine.

448
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,600
And so, yeah, so that's what we've got.

449
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,800
And the only reason I was showing that is because we may already have

450
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
this value pre inverted.

451
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,800
So, if we wanted to fuss with that, right?

452
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,600
I'm going to go ahead and, and kind of lean on the loop Live code

453
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:14,800
editing.

454
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,500
A bit here.

455
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm going to go ahead and

456
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,000
This so that we can kind of see what's going on.

457
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,500
So if like, if I come in here to our drawbitmap routine, it seems you

458
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,400
know if we take a look we already have that one - sa term, right?

459
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,600
We've already got that on there and so if you think of that term as as

460
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:44,400
in vessei, I'm just going to call that in vessei for now in sa inverse

461
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,700
is probably the not the best term but you know, sometimes you

462
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Not too sure what the one- would really be called, right?

463
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,300
So, if I change that to invest a right, nothing, nothing will change.

464
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,500
We're doing exact same blending equation, there.

465
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,800
Of course, I guess.

466
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That I think about it.

467
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,700
We need to rerun the the blind every time.

468
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,800
So you know what we could do to is let me

469
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,100
Draw test round.

470
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,200
Let me actually call that every frame.

471
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,700
So we'll tank our frame rate again, but that way it'll update

472
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,700
continuously for us, right?

473
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,700
So, if I just put this in here, right there we go.

474
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,700
Now we're drawing it every time so,

475
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:30,600
If we.

476
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,200
Does draw test ground but draw test down.

477
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Doesn't clear the image.

478
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,200
Hmm.

479
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,300
Yeah, so that's I can't keep doing that because otherwise, yeah,

480
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,300
you'll get that sort of hmm.

481
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,500
Well, so I guess what, I'll have to do is actually put in a drawer

482
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,400
rectangle, called to clear it.

483
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,700
Right draw test ground that we can then remove later.

484
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,500
So it would be this, right?

485
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,800
We're drawing to the buffer and and clearing it right?

486
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,800
And we'd want to clear it.

487
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,600
Oh, and you know what I could do to, I could use

488
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,300
A size for that but yeah.

489
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,500
So let's let's just see what happens if I do that.

490
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,300
There we go.

491
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,300
There we got our black Fringe back.

492
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,100
Okay, so now it's going and you can see it's going much slower because

493
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,900
we it's not actually caching the bitmap.

494
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,300
So let's go ahead and and play with that drawbitmap now

495
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Alright, so in my drawbitmap call.

496
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,800
Now what I want to know is what should happen with this Alpha channel,

497
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,700
right?

498
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,400
And if we take a look at what we wrote out here, I said it was sa plus

499
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,600
1.

500
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
Minus s Ada, right?

501
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,200
And if you look that's exactly what we were doing with everything

502
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,700
else.

503
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,500
We're just doing the inverse S A times the the destination right plus

504
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,400
that that sa right.

505
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
That's that's exactly.

506
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,100
We're doing so.

507
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,600
All right, so if I just, let's see what happens if I just go ahead and

508
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,000
use that as our compositor.

509
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,100
That's not quite right.

510
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:23,800
That's right.

511
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,600
We've got these into different spaces.

512
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,900
I forgot about that.

513
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,200
So unfortunately, these are still all 0 to 255, aren't they?

514
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,500
So da is in a different space than essay in this case, which is not

515
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,000
what we wanted.

516
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,200
So what we kind of need to do here is we need to actually we need to

517
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,100
actually save essay in that case.

518
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,700
So I guess we'll have to sort of introduce maybe this for example,

519
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,200
right?

520
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,100
If we were to load them all out and then I grab

521
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,600
out of

522
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Looks like so.

523
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,100
So if I were to keep them in the right space and then I just make a

524
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:18,000
real-valued version of The Source Alpha where we still have, what the

525
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,700
source Alpha is in the, in 255 land, right?

526
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,100
That would allow me to do what I need to do here to allow the blending

527
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,300
to work properly, right?

528
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,700
So now everything's in the same space if you don't have one, that's

529
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,700
been normalized and one that's in the range of 0 to 55, which isn't

530
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,300
going to work.

531
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,900
So I believe that would give us back to all right.

532
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,300
I'm not exactly it.

533
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
I believe that would give us what we wanted.

534
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,900
So that stuff is now you know in that in that correct space.

535
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,700
So when we load out the essay now that's a number from 0 to 25.

536
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,200
We divide that by 2 T5 to give us a number between 1 and 0.

537
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,200
We make the inverse of that by subtracting it from one.

538
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,800
But obviously I made a bit of a faux pas there because now we have an

539
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
amazing rainbow pixel screen which

540
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Which honestly is kind of a little bit mesmerizing, but yeah, so what

541
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
did I mess up there?

542
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,200
I took out the source Alpha I did, in fact, divide it by 255, which is

543
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,700
what we wanted.

544
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,200
So that turns it from 0 to 1.

545
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,700
The C Alpha is just that coefficient so that we can like dim things,

546
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,200
right?

547
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,400
So that's fine.

548
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,700
The destination Alpha is getting, read out as a number between 0 to 25

549
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,100
there.

550
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,700
And I think, oh, there it is.

551
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,300
Right there are I forgot to put, you know, I forgot to replace that

552
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,800
with the new value that we computed.

553
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,500
Okay, so there we go.

554
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
So our least our Blitz is working that properly.

555
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,400
So now we just need to get our other destination Alpha stuff to be

556
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,000
correct.

557
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,100
So if I composite these things together that right?

558
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,700
Okay, there we go.

559
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,200
And that one still needs to be the source Alpha because this is that's

560
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
actually the blend.

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,300
So it would be, you know, that way.

562
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,600
All right, so, given that, that is that first method that we were

563
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,500
talking about, right?

564
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,700
That is, that is the method that we, that we wrote here, write the

565
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,000
essay plus 1 minus s Ada.

566
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,400
Right, that's exactly this.

567
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,200
And so the question is, did that produce, does that produce the result

568
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,000
that we expect

569
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
and the first question is well,

570
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,800
You know, is there anything objectionable about the way that composite

571
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
is working?

572
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,300
And, you know, if we take a look at what happens in these sort of edge

573
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,200
regions here, what I'd like to do is, maybe take a look at what they

574
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,900
look like in Gimp to see sort of, you know, what would be a reasonable

575
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,000
thing to have occur.

576
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Now, if I, if I go

577
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And open up.

578
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:11,900
Let's see, start made beta if I go and open up one of these that we're

579
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,300
using.

580
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,100
In Gimp so I can actually do what its edges look like.

581
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,600
I'm going to go ahead and here and make a, an actual thing that is

582
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,400
essentially the same as what we have screen.

583
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,800
So we've got a half bright thing, 128, 128 128, right?

584
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,800
So, I'm going to take a layer here and just fill it with that.

585
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
So we've got that essentially, right?

586
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,000
And so you know that that is what what one of these looks like.

587
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,100
When we composite it, just one of those sort of

588
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,900
Flats onto the screen.

589
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,600
And similarly, if I go in here and I open as layers, some more of

590
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,700
these, right?

591
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,600
I'm trying to think of which just trying to make sure we get a bunch

592
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,300
of them in here.

593
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,200
Right, so you can see some of them do have like darker regions Ground.

594
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,700
Zero doesn't write that one doesn't as much that one does have some

595
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,500
Darkness to it.

596
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,800
And so on what I'd like to do is say okay, let's take a look at at one

597
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,600
of these ones that doesn't have any any darkening fringes around it

598
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,300
and let's just use that one for the compositing and let's make sure

599
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,100
that our Alpha equation that we were picking their doesn't produce a

600
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,600
bad sort of fringing effect.

601
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:32,900
Let's make sure

602
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,700
That that when you composite layer these on top of each other, it

603
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,100
looks okay, right?

604
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,400
So in order to do that, this is Ground Zero Zero dot bitmap is the one

605
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,000
that I had.

606
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,200
So I'm going to do is in that draw test ground function.

607
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,400
I'm just going to go ahead and see what I'm going to go ahead here and

608
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,900
see what

609
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,900
what selection we were using.

610
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,000
So this is grass.

611
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
I'll turn off the grass entirely.

612
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,600
So we don't have that, right?

613
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,300
Let me bring that back up here.

614
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,400
So grass is gone entirely.

615
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,300
Oh whoops.

616
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,700
Sorry that that actually also draws the stone.

617
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,900
So what we want to do is turn off the grass entirely here, like that.

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
And then we also want to.

619
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,500
Well, in fact, you know what I could do is just say, all right, you

620
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,300
know what, here's our else clause.

621
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,200
There we go.

622
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,800
So we're just going to take that first stone bitmap and we're going to

623
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
use that, right?

624
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
So what you can kind of see here,

625
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:48,400
Is if you look at, if you look at what happens this didn't have any of

626
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
that darkness in it, right?

627
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,600
There was no when you can positive, this on this doesn't have any of

628
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,700
that Darkness on there, but if you look at what happens with the

629
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
actual bitmap you

630
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,300
You all of that darkness in there, right?

631
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,200
And so the question is, you know, what happened?

632
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,000
There is our Alpha equation wrong, why are we getting that?

633
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,900
Why are we getting that?

634
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,400
That Darkness, right?

635
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,200
And the other thing, we might try just to see right?

636
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
Is what would happen.

637
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,700
If we turned off that?

638
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,200
What would happen if we turned that off basically?

639
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,800
Right?

640
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,200
What would happen if we said?

641
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,500
We don't actually want

642
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,500
Let's see here, it map.

643
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,900
Sorry getting very sleepy today so it's a little sluggish.

644
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,500
What would happen if we just said?

645
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,200
Alright, the alpha is always just going to be 1, right?

646
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,400
So what does it look like if we just if we just always put in that 255

647
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,100
value there?

648
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,700
Right?

649
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,800
So, if I, if I restart it here, right?

650
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,600
And you can kind of see, you can kind of start to understand what's

651
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,300
happening there.

652
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,800
What we're getting is, we're getting the black of

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,400
The cleared buffer.

654
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,500
So the buffer that you know, when we cleared it initially to just have

655
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,900
nothing in it, what we're getting is that black color of the buffer is

656
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,699
bleeding through to our result?

657
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,100
Does that make sense?

658
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:32,500
And so that can kind of guide us towards fixing, what's wrong with our

659
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,000
compositing so far so that we won't introduce that black at the edges.

660
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,699
So again I picked a real bad episode.

661
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,500
Had to be talking about the math of alpha compositing, because we are

662
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,100
still, you know, because this pen doesn't work at all.

663
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,199
Oh and you know what I should also do.

664
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,600
Let's double-check that ad and clamp doesn't work either, right?

665
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,200
The other thing that we were thinking of so add and clamp if we were

666
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,400
to do that again here is oops.

667
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,600
There we go.

668
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,600
Add and clamp.

669
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,500
If we're to do that, that's what we're currently at.

670
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,300
And if we were to do ad and clamp instead of this, that would just be

671
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,900
a equals D.

672
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,000
Ay + sa.

673
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,400
And then we just say, if a is greater than 255 a equals 235, right?

674
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,800
Just we just pull on clamp it and you can see that we still get the

675
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,000
same problem, right?

676
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,300
So it doesn't actually matter which of those two we did.

677
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
It still doesn't work, right?

678
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,000
So what can we do here?

679
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
What's the problem?

680
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,900
What's going on?

681
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,900
Well, I don't know.

682
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's go back to the.

683
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,100
Let's go back to the the Blackboard and see if we can figure it out.

684
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,100
So

685
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,100
what's happening is we're getting color bleeding through so we don't

686
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,400
necessarily know if it may not be our Alpha.

687
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That's at fault here, right?

688
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,500
It could be that we're dealing with the.

689
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,100
It could be that we're dealing with with the colors and correctly,

690
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,400
right?

691
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,300
So let's think about what was happening there.

692
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,000
What was happening there was we had a color that was in the buffer,

693
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,600
right?

694
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,800
So so here's the source color, Source color is 0, right?

695
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,700
And then we had a destination and and I'll put the source Alpha here,

696
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,300
right?

697
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,800
So we had a source color and let's just say, we're looking at one

698
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,600
channel, right?

699
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Like the red Channel or something.

700
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,900
So in fact, I could make

701
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
That more explicit.

702
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,200
So let's say we have the source, read Source, read was zero, right?

703
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,500
Then we have the source Alpha and the source Alpha was some, you know,

704
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
percentage was .5, it was on those edges.

705
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,600
Right.

706
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,700
And so we have the source of the source color being this, we have the

707
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,700
thesaurus Alpha being that and then we're compositing against

708
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Oh, I'm sorry again to Sleepy today.

709
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,600
This is the source.

710
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
So the source red is some color.

711
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,200
It's point seven or something like that, right?

712
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,700
And the source Alpha was some, you know, portion that was .5 or

713
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,300
whatever it was.

714
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:07,900
Right.

715
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,400
And so then we have the Des tread and the desperate is cleared because

716
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
the buffer doesn't have anything in it.

717
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,300
So it's just clear.

718
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:18,400
20 and the destination Alpha has nothing in it as well, right?

719
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,000
So what's going to happen when we do this composite, right?

720
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,300
When we do this blend, what we're going to get is we're going to blend

721
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,200
The Source red and the dust read together, right?

722
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,600
And maybe I'll make this point eight just to make the math a little

723
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,700
easier on us, right?

724
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,700
When we blend that dashed red in there with the source red, we're

725
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,200
going to end up with point for, right.

726
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
We're going to go halfway in between these two because it's a halfway

727
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,100
Blends according to the source Alpha, right?

728
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,900
So the resulting color, right?

729
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,900
the new destination read in the buffer is going to be point for

730
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,800
The alpha channel is going to be something else, right?

731
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,500
Whatever we compute, it's going to be something else because we were

732
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,300
just talking about whatever that we don't know what it is.

733
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,100
We're obviously Doing It Wrong maybe and so it's going to be something

734
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,300
else.

735
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,000
So they'll be something else in here right now, when we go to do our

736
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,500
final thing because now we've got the screen read and the screen has

737
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,600
no Alpha right but we're this is our screen buffer that were actually

738
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,700
going to draw when

739
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,700
Go to composite these two together, right?

740
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,400
We wanted it to be the same as if we were compositing, these two

741
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,600
things, right?

742
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,600
This and this and I guess I shouldn't use screen because we're using

743
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,500
source for that.

744
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,000
So, we'll call this be

745
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,600
For buffer, I don't know.

746
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,800
Back buffer, let's say so whatever this this happened to be, you know,

747
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,500
if this was point five, right?

748
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,000
What we want to do is this is point five for that gray and this was

749
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,800
originally .8, if

750
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,200
We're to blend these two together.

751
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,200
Right?

752
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:08,300
What we would have expected is to get halfway between .5 + .8, right?

753
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,000
If we were doing the blind just directly like we're doing before,

754
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,800
right?

755
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,900
So what we wanted to get was something like, you know, Point 65 or

756
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,200
something like this, right?

757
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,500
We want to get halfway, we want to get point eight plus 0.5 over to

758
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,300
write if that makes sense.

759
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
So that's a point, three difference of .15.

760
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,600
So yeah, it's like you know, it's like point six five.

761
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,500
We want it.

762
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
We wanted that.

763
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,600
So what we wanted to see for our red Channel.

764
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,200
Well, nothing I'm ever going to do is going to produce a point, 65

765
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,100
once this has become point for this is now way too low, right?

766
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,800
For that to actually occur.

767
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,700
So what can we do right?

768
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,100
What there's there's no it looks to me.

769
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,000
Like we've we've backed ourselves into a very problematic situation

770
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,500
and essentially what's going on here, right?

771
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,200
Is, this is kind of like, I mean, I guess I don't know if it's the

772
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,900
best motivating case for it but this gets back to

773
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,800
This to do right here, which is someday we need to talk about

774
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
premultiplied Alpha.

775
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
This is not premultiplied Alpha, right?

776
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,900
Well what you can see here is that if we if we really want to try and

777
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,000
Tackle this problem it looks like we knew and we need a new way of

778
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,200
encoding the color, right?

779
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,200
So that when we encode the color, we don't have this problem.

780
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,600
Where we back ourselves into a situation where it doesn't look like we

781
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,500
can possibly produce the result that we actually wanted from the

782
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,900
inputs to the system, right?

783
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,300
And that's where premultiplied Alpha comes in.

784
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,300
So, if you take a look at what's going on in these equations,

785
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,200
premultiplied Alpha originally came sort of as an optimization, it was

786
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,500
an optimization idea.

787
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,100
And what it was looking at was the fact that like, hey, wait a minute

788
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,300
when I do these computations.

789
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,600
When I do the blending, you'll notice that I'm always multiplying the

790
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,200
colors of the source by their Alpha channel, right?

791
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,300
They never we never use S RS, G or SB we only

792
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
Who's them X their original values, right?

793
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,100
So it's like, okay, why don't I just store the bitmap pre multiplied

794
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,100
so that I don't have to do these anymore, right?

795
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,500
Why couldn't I just, why would I just do that?

796
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,900
And so that I don't have to do those multiplies, right?

797
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,000
It's more efficient and that's where premultiplication really kind of

798
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,100
came from her initially, but it turns out if we take a look at that

799
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,200
pre multiplication,

800
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,900
We can actually get, we can actually potentially fix this problem as

801
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,100
well.

802
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,400
So, let's let's quickly take a look at what would happen if we were to

803
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,900
change that encoding, right?

804
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
So let's say we have the

805
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
Same thing again.

806
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,000
So we have a source read that was supposed to be .8, right?

807
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,900
And we have a source Alpha That was supposed to be point five.

808
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,200
Right, like so.

809
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,300
And then again, we have that background, we're going to do eventually.

810
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,200
So will do, will do exactly the same setup.

811
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,600
So we've got Dr.

812
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And and da here Dr.

813
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,800
Da and we got those has zero and zero.

814
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,100
So let's suppose instead of storing, this is point eight, we store it

815
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,500
premultiplied, right?

816
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,900
So it's already going to be multiplied by its source, Alpha value,

817
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,400
right?

818
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,300
So this is already going to be 0.45.

819
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,800
I'm sorry point for right, so it's already going to be what it would

820
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,100
have been when it's when it's going into this buffer, right?

821
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,000
So now what will happen when we do our Alpha blending equation.

822
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,600
Is when I composite.

823
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,800
So let's let's say we were going to do that screen composite will just

824
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,600
say so our final thing.

825
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,600
So we're going to skip this step here for a second and we're going to

826
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,900
do this green composite.

827
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,700
So we've got our screen.

828
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,900
Our buffer that's in there.

829
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:14,400
It's got the point five in it and we're going to do this composite

830
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,200
right now with premultiplied Alpha, right?

831
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,700
So you already saw me do what that is?

832
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,000
Even was, we're just saying we're getting rid of that multiplication

833
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,500
term.

834
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,300
So instead of doing the equation down here that we were doing before

835
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,100
where we were saying, okay, so it's going to be 1, minus the source

836
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Alpha, right times, the buffer, plus the source Alpha times, the

837
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,400
source color, right?

838
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,600
That's what we were doing before we're saying this is going to be P

839
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,200
multiplied.

840
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,300
So the actual thing that we're going to compute is 1 minus the source

841
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,700
of a time's the buffer plus whatever that premultiplied.

842
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Al you already was.

843
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,500
This is the new equation, right?

844
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,100
So we don't X that Source Alpha.

845
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
So let's say right,

846
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,700
That we're going to do that.

847
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,300
We now get exactly what we had wanted to use me.

848
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,100
What we had wanted to get before, so what?

849
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
Because Watch What Happens, right?

850
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,400
I plug these in.

851
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,300
And I get 1 minus sa, which is still point five because one minus

852
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,400
Point 5 is 0.5 times.

853
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,900
B r, which is 0.5.

854
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,000
So, .5 x .5 is 0.25, right?

855
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,700
And then I want to take the The Source color, which is point for right

856
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,600
and add them together and I get exactly the value that I wanted,

857
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,400
right?

858
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,600
It's exactly the right value .65.

859
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,400
This is exactly what we said we wanted now.

860
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,500
How did it do that?

861
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,200
It does that?

862
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,900
Because now we're encoding that value that we add directly.

863
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,900
So we don't have this problem of over of having to get a number over

864
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,000
one, to do to ever produce this actual blend to occur, right?

865
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,100
We've pre encoded that multiplication and so we can just produce the

866
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,400
value directly, right?

867
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,700
So that works just fine.

868
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,000
Just like in the old case and that would have worked up here, right?

869
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:10,400
And so now when we do this, when we do an intermediate stage

870
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,700
It will flow through properly.

871
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,900
So Watch What Happens, right?

872
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:22,500
I do the blend here and I get the exact same equation that we're doing

873
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,300
down here, right?

874
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,600
Is going to happen.

875
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,900
So I take the source red of point for, I take the destination red of 0

876
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,500
and obviously doesn't matter what I multiply by zero.

877
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,100
So the one - Source Alpha times, 0 is just going to be 0 again.

878
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,600
So and then I add the source red.

879
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,300
And so the source red persists as point for

880
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,600
Right.

881
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,600
Let's just put in directly.

882
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I don't know what we're calling this.

883
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
We're calling this Dr.

884
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,400
So Dr.

885
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,300
Is .4.

886
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,900
And then the destination Alpha, right?

887
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,800
The destination Alpha.

888
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,400
We know we now can in a position to directly, see what, that should be

889
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,200
the destination Alpha.

890
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,200
Well, I guess maybe not.

891
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,500
Well - we might to work through.

892
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,400
We'll have to work through another case where this has some

893
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,800
destination outfit in it to see exactly what the equation should be

894
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,200
for that.

895
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,800
So, sorry, I misspoke

896
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,500
So, in order for this to still work, obviously, the destination Alpha,

897
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,100
if we wanted this to come out, exactly the same, which we do the

898
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,400
destination Alpha is going to have to be the same as the source off of

899
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,600
there, right?

900
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,600
It's going to have to be point five in order for that in order for

901
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,200
that to work, right?

902
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,000
And then we go and go ahead and and and then we go ahead and finish

903
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,200
the blend, right?

904
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,100
Does that make sense?

905
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,500
Because we know that we wanted it, we know that it needs to pass

906
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,400
through exactly.

907
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,500
In this case, in order for this to still produce the .65 that we

908
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,000
wanted.

909
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,700
So that we know that in the case, where the destination outfit 0, we

910
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,800
want the source Alpha to be Point 5 and now we've corrected this

911
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,700
problem that we have here but we still don't know.

912
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,100
We need to work through one more case to figure out what we want to

913
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,200
have happen if the destination alpha or Eddie had

914
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,400
Nothing in it, right?

915
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,400
So if we go ahead and do one more, so let's say we do the exact same

916
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,100
thing again.

917
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,300
And we think through what we want that to be, let's say that we had

918
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,700
Source our source, Alpha death star dust Alpha and let's say that the

919
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,200
dest alpha in this particular case was going to be.

920
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:29,800
I don't know.

921
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,200
Let's say it's .5.

922
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Let's say let's say the destination Alpha is is actually

923
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,300
Maybe.

924
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,700
Let's seems that seems like probably the best thing to try next.

925
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,700
I'm going to go with that.

926
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,100
I haven't worked out this sort of stuff in a long time so I'm sorry if

927
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,000
I'm not picking the exact right set of cases to kind of show it as

928
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,900
easily as possible.

929
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,400
That's that's interrupt you.

930
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,700
So if we had our destination read of zero and we had our source red,

931
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,800
let's say the source red again.

932
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,600
Is the point eight, so it's multiplied, pretty multiplied.

933
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:04,700
Right?

934
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,200
So what we would want to have happen here, remember this was

935
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,600
originally a source Alpha of .8 before it got P multiplied by its

936
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:11,900
source.

937
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,600
Alpha channel of point five, right?

938
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,500
So if I had a background that was fully opaque already and there was a

939
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,300
zero in there, right?

940
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,300
I would want to produce

941
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:31,200
A result that was a halfway blend between these two color values,

942
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,800
right?

943
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,200
I would want to say that I want to go point five of the way 2 .8.

944
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,100
So I want to have point for in the resulting destination read/write

945
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,800
point for and certainly I still want to have a destination Alpha of 1

946
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,500
as well, right?

947
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,800
Because if it was already opaque, it should continue to be opaque at

948
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,300
the end.

949
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,600
Right.

950
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,700
So we come through there and then at the end of that, we would, we

951
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,500
would lend against the screen.

952
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,300
So the ad will still work here.

953
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,000
No matter what we do, the in Source, Alpha will work exactly

954
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,400
correctly.

955
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,400
So that that blend equation that we're using before works, and the

956
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,200
destination Alpha in that case, we would want to pass through exactly

957
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
because it should produce an opaque blend of point for.

958
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:20,200
All right, so now what happens again if this was .5 let's let's keep I

959
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,800
don't want to keep having to draw this tree, right?

960
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,400
So you know that.

961
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,700
Pass through in that case if we were going to say that it was .5.

962
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,000
Now what should the destination Alpha be right in the actual result?

963
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,600
Because in this case we're saying all right, we had something that

964
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,700
comes in its half so that we know that the color that we produce

965
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,600
should be halfway in between these two colors, right?

966
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,800
The original color here, we know was also 0.

967
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,400
Because, obviously, if the destination Alpha minus point five, it had

968
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,700
to be point five times.

969
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,100
The original color to produce the destination, which would be 0.

970
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
And similarly, here we know it's the

971
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,200
Point eight.

972
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,100
So we're still want to produce point for here again.

973
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,900
Same equation.

974
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,200
Nothing particularly confusing going on there.

975
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,100
But again we get into that destination Alpha situation.

976
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,400
What do we want to produce as the final destination Alpha here?

977
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,500
Right?

978
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,000
And so if we had that screen buffers read write and that screen

979
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,600
buffers read was .5 as it was before, right?

980
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,400
What would happen if we had done two, subsequent blends?

981
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,200
On this right?

982
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,400
What we're saying is if we had just done these two in series, first

983
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,400
this one, and then this one right?

984
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:41,200
What would the resulting color be and that will tell us what the

985
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,600
destination Alpha should be to make sure that that gets reproduced,

986
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,400
right?

987
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,700
And again that's a little complicated but but thankfully we've got

988
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,200
we've got a little more time here, right?

989
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,400
We've got we've got about 9 more minutes.

990
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,000
It's well, this was almost an entirely Blackboard episode.

991
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:06,200
The exact wrong day for that because the Blackboard thing was the

992
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,600
Blackboard pen is broken.

993
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,700
Some days you just don't have any luck.

994
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,000
That's okay, I was sleepy today.

995
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:13,900
So what do you do?

996
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,300
All right, so back to where we were at.

997
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
So if we were to do these two things separately, right?

998
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
Well we know what we wanted to have happen.

999
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,800
Sorry, so if we were to produce these two things separately, when we

1000
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,000
do the drd, a blend here with against the screen, right?

1001
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,100
So if we were to do this one against a br of point, five, right?

1002
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,200
Then the color that we would expect to end up with would be point two

1003
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,300
five, right?

1004
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,500
You expect to get that after doing, after drawing this, to the screen

1005
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:52,200
because we're doing a halfway blend between 0, the original color 0

1006
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,300
and the original color point five, right?

1007
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,900
So we'd expect you to cover .25 and then we would come along and we

1008
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,400
would blend this guy in there, right?

1009
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,800
We would say, all right, the SR, the essay, we would expect to blend

1010
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,500
this in there and say point four point five.

1011
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
So now we want

1012
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,400
Halfway blend again, between whatever is in there and .8, right?

1013
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,300
So I'll do the Emax quick calc there.

1014
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:30,900
We basically want halfway blend between 0.25 and 2.8, right?

1015
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,100
We want to average those two guys together so it's point five, two

1016
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:34,600
five.

1017
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:40,100
So after that next we want point five, two five.

1018
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,800
So our goal is obviously

1019
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,500
Maybe we can just tell from working it through.

1020
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,900
We want to produce that as the actual eventual result in this, in this

1021
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,600
color channel, that is what we need.

1022
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,900
So given that we know that we're going to come out with a point for

1023
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,200
here.

1024
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,500
The question is, what is the alpha value, right?

1025
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:06,500
That when we when we do that equation to be, are there, what is the

1026
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,100
alpha value?

1027
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,600
That would that would actually produce that, right?

1028
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,600
Does that make sense?

1029
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:16,300
So, we need some equation of sa and da, that's going to produce the

1030
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,200
proper result there.

1031
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,300
And so, to produce the actual color value, again, we're doing, we're

1032
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:29,200
just doing one - the alpha Channel times, whatever was in the, ER,

1033
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,700
Plus whatever the, the incoming color is, right?

1034
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,600
So when we look at that, we're saying that that result has to be Point

1035
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,700
5 to 5.

1036
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,400
We know that

1037
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,100
The incoming be are there is point five, right?

1038
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,500
We know that the incoming red channel is going to be point four.

1039
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,400
So what we need is something where one minus a x .5, oops times 0.5

1040
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,700
plus point for

1041
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,100
Is going to equal point five two five, right?

1042
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,300
And it's pretty easy to see what that would be.

1043
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:10,000
If we just actually go through this, we end up with Point 5 minus

1044
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,800
Point 5 a right distributive equals point one, two five, right?

1045
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,800
So, if I subtract from both sides, I get Negative point five a equals.

1046
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,900
Well, - because it's .125 - boy

1047
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,100
Five, right?

1048
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,800
I never am good with math like this, so, I always do some point 5,

1049
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:41,400
minus point one, two, five, we go .375 - .375 and divide both sides by

1050
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,300
the point five.

1051
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:49,000
So, if you could do last result in quick calc, I bet you can .375

1052
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,300
divided by 0.5.

1053
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
There we go and we get 0.75.

1054
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,000
Right?

1055
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
So let's just double check that that works properly.

1056
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,700
So basically one minus Point 1, minus 0.25 that would be point.

1057
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:09,600
I'm sorry 1 minus 0.75 that would be point two five, right?

1058
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,400
So point two five times 0.5 plus point for its double check

1059
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,400
Point two, five times 0.5 plus point for give this our value, right?

1060
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,700
So now we got another piece of the puzzle.

1061
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,200
We know that the the alpha value here.

1062
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,000
Is going to have to be point two five, right?

1063
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,400
So it's starting to look like, okay, well that's you know, that's the

1064
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,100
source Alpha times, the destination Alpha, right?

1065
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,200
That's just sa x d a.

1066
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,600
So it kind of looks like s Ada is what goes in here right now.

1067
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,100
We can click test that, but we haven't really mathematically worked

1068
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,500
out.

1069
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,300
That's actually true, but we kind of see.

1070
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,900
We can kind of see where that starting to go.

1071
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,900
So if we were to pre multiply things,

1072
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,500
That is what would happen.

1073
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,300
Let's quickly go ahead and change if we were to do this, right?

1074
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,400
If we wanted to

1075
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,000
Switch to that.

1076
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,100
Premultiplied Alpha.

1077
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,200
You can kind of see where is my load groups, where's my loaded bitmap?

1078
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,600
There is debugger bitmap call.

1079
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,200
So if you want to change to premultiplied Alpha to start to get this

1080
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,600
working right, what we would have to do is when we're doing when were

1081
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,400
you know, writing out our destination stuff here, we have to do.

1082
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:29,400
So we have to be able to pre multiply whatever it is.

1083
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,300
That's coming in.

1084
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,700
To put it into this format, where where, instead of storing the colors

1085
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,200
themselves we started them premultiplied, right?

1086
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,400
So if I wanted to do that, what I need to do is say all right.

1087
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,800
Well the alpha is going to have to be pulled out here, right?

1088
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,700
First of all, so so that we can get it.

1089
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,300
So we've got to get that Alpha value out like so so that that like

1090
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,300
that, we've got to get that Alpha value out.

1091
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,200
And then when we actually do,

1092
00:56:59,700 --> 00:56:59,800
I,

1093
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,800
It's not exactly the way it should do that because we don't want that

1094
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,600
rotate Alpha shift part.

1095
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,200
So when we actually get the alpha Max mask out,

1096
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,600
This is a little bit weird, so Superman's redshift.

1097
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,900
Okay so basically this was the place we were kind of getting

1098
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,400
overzealous with our bit scanning and all that sort of stuff.

1099
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,700
So this is actually not quite what we want because what we want to do

1100
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:29,000
here is actually multiply is actually get out those channels, do the

1101
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,900
multiplications and then put them into position.

1102
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:37,400
So really we don't want what we're doing here because this puts them

1103
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,200
directly into position as they get loaded, but we want to actually get

1104
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,200
them out first, right?

1105
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,000
So, let's go ahead and take that one step at a time.

1106
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,900
I'm going to go ahead and kill this guy, so if we take a look at what

1107
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,500
happens now, when we load, that's what we get.

1108
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,300
Let's go ahead and add that pre multiplication step here in.

1109
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,400
Well, let's even just take it one step further once.

1110
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:02,300
Step slower.

1111
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,700
Let's actually grab out each individual channel so that we can get

1112
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,300
what we want out of it.

1113
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,000
All right, so if I was to do an RGB pull here, right?

1114
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,700
So I'm going to get, there are G, the B.

1115
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:23,100
And the, a, what I want to do is I want to to shift them down first,

1116
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,600
which is how we had this code set up originally, but then people were

1117
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,900
like, you should just shift it directly into place, which is true for

1118
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,200
what we were doing, but it's not exactly what we wanted.

1119
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,100
I should have resisted the urge.

1120
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,400
When people said that you should do that, I should have said no, but

1121
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,100
it was good to show.

1122
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,700
I guess how we do it, so that's fine.

1123
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,800
All right, so we found the least significant bits of these guys, so we

1124
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,000
know actually what the shifts are for them.

1125
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:51,800
We know that, you know, in fact, I guess we could say that we've got

1126
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:56,900
two shifts here, we've got, we've got a red shift up in a red shift

1127
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,000
down, kind of a thing.

1128
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,300
So, we know that when we when we rev, when we read, when we shift the

1129
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,900
red down, it's going to be there.

1130
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,700
And when we put it back into position, it's going to be there, right?

1131
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,700
This is green shift up.

1132
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,300
This is blue shift up.

1133
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,300
And this is Alpha shift up.

1134
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,300
All right, so these scans that we did our, what we want to do for

1135
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:38,500
shifting down, so really, what all we need to do is, is take our masks

1136
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,400
stuff here and we can just do the shift directly.

1137
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,800
We don't need that rotate anymore.

1138
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,400
So when we rotate it down, this is our refuge redshift down where

1139
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,300
we're going to grab it out there.

1140
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,400
We can just go ahead and do that for all the different colors, right?

1141
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,200
Green mask.

1142
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,900
Blue mask.

1143
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,800
Alpha mask.

1144
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,800
I'll shift

1145
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,700
Blue shift down range it down.

1146
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,700
So we grab those out.

1147
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,900
And then we just need to put them back, right?

1148
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,500
So then we just need to say, all right?

1149
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,200
We've got the, our redshift up like so.

1150
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,900
Pudgy, green shift up.

1151
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,100
4B.

1152
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,400
You shut up.

1153
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,900
And they.

1154
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:40,300
I'll shift up, right down down down so that Loops that should produce

1155
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,500
exactly the same thing that we had before, right?

1156
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,300
No worries there everything's fine.

1157
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,600
So you know

1158
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,900
We've done the exact same letting me before.

1159
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,500
So now all we have to do is do that pre multiplication.

1160
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,500
I don't want to have to talk about exactly how to do the fixed point.

1161
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,700
A fixed Point multiplied here.

1162
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,300
So I'm going to do exactly the same thing that we did in our Alpha

1163
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,400
blender which is just do the conversion in and out.

1164
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,500
So I'm just going to say alright let's just say that we got these out

1165
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,100
as reels for now, right?

1166
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,900
And so I'm going to convert them after we do that.

1167
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,200
In two floating Point values.

1168
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,100
So we can let the floating Point multiplier do it.

1169
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,800
For us, right?

1170
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:25,100
So there we go.

1171
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,000
So, we can convert those into reals.

1172
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:31,900
Like so.

1173
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,600
And then we're going to do that that same exact procedure we did

1174
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,700
before, where we kind of take a normalized version of a, if you will.

1175
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,000
So, we say that we get, we take it, and we divide it by 255, so we can

1176
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,200
produce a number between 0 and 1, right?

1177
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:58,200
Now what we actually want to do is just in you know, do that

1178
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,000
multiplication.

1179
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,200
So we want our to be equal to R times n.

1180
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,900
So that now we're pre multiplying by that Alpha channel.

1181
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:05,800
Right?

1182
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,500
And and we want to round it after that.

1183
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,500
So I believe what were we doing?

1184
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,300
We already did sort of that in our drawbitmap call.

1185
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,300
We already sort of we're doing that rounding here and we were just

1186
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,100
doing it directly this way so we can continue to do it that way.

1187
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,700
In fact, we can just copy this exact thing.

1188
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:23,400
Right.

1189
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,900
That's exactly what we wanted to do.

1190
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,300
Like, so, right.

1191
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,100
So for our source desk and then that gets us out of that.

1192
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,500
The shifts are already baked in there.

1193
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,300
There we go.

1194
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,000
So we can get rid of that.

1195
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,600
You can also get rid of this.

1196
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:44,700
Right, so once we actually do this, all we really need to do now.

1197
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:49,000
Is multiply each of these guys, by that Alpha to get that

1198
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,100
premultiplied thing?

1199
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,600
Right.

1200
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:58,300
And I can leave that out for a second just so we can see if that are

1201
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,800
that are function still works when we run it.

1202
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,200
That we haven't broken anything.

1203
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,100
And so now if I pre multiply by that Alpha now I've got premultiplied

1204
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,700
Alpha coming in.

1205
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,100
We haven't changed our blend equation.

1206
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,400
So things are going to look wrong, as you can see, everything's got a

1207
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,300
little bit of a black outline around it.

1208
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,900
With some people may prefer, but that should be in the source art.

1209
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,600
If we want it, not something that's, that's coming out the alphabet as

1210
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,700
artifact of the creation.

1211
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,200
So if we change that, that premultiplied Alpha there.

1212
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:28,000
Now, in our drawbitmap call, we can actually say let's assume that we

1213
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,800
have that pre multiply

1214
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,400
Alpha.

1215
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,200
So, that means we just get rid of these are sa terms, right?

1216
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,500
Those are sa terms, go away.

1217
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And now, we're back to where we started looking at these guys, right,

1218
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,400
you can kind of see exactly what what's happening there.

1219
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,600
Everything looks fine, right?

1220
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,700
And what's interesting too is you'll notice we've already even though

1221
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,600
we haven't even looked at what that term should be.

1222
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,500
We've already gotten rid of that black fringing, right?

1223
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,400
So premultiplied Alpha is already working for us even though we

1224
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,600
haven't even finished.

1225
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,500
Out what exactly we should set the destination Alpha to we're already

1226
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,800
just accidentally because premultiplied, Alpha is just easier to work

1227
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:09,000
with.

1228
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,100
In that way, we've already actually gotten better than what we kind of

1229
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,000
had had before, right?

1230
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:18,900
All right.

1231
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,400
So what we were saying, what we were saying back here?

1232
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,100
Is that well okay, we know that this is sa X da, that's what that is.

1233
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:37,300
But of course, it was .5 and .5 so at some level you know it's it's a

1234
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:41,600
little bit odd to do the calculation because we don't know this could

1235
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,000
have been one - it could have been you know the equation that we wrote

1236
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,100
here accidentally just from from before could actually be right

1237
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,300
because in our essay 1 minus Point 5 would also be point five so this

1238
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,300
would end up being

1239
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,500
Really sa X ta + SA or whatever.

1240
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,200
So, this may actually be the right equation that we had ended up with

1241
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,500
here.

1242
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,700
We need some way of actually figuring out what that should be.

1243
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,500
And so what I'd like to do is just do exactly what we did with the

1244
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,600
examples here.

1245
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
But do it with algebra so that we kind of can see what the we actually

1246
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,800
want the result to be.

1247
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,900
Now this is going to get really messy and this is why I said I picked

1248
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:24,600
exactly the wrong day to do this because the Blackboard pain is not.

1249
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,700
Working properly.

1250
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,400
And what can you do?

1251
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,600
But

1252
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,800
I mean, you got to do what you got to do.

1253
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,800
Let's we want to finish what we started.

1254
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,200
So you saw me work through these examples to kind of show you how

1255
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
things are going to work.

1256
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,100
All we really need to do, if we want to figure out what these things

1257
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:43,700
should be.

1258
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,800
Is just not use numeric values like passed through the actual terms

1259
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
and then we should be able to solve for what that composited version

1260
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,900
is.

1261
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:59,600
We should be able to see what the the math works out to be right.

1262
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,500
I'd like to do here and it's going to be ugly.

1263
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,300
But what you going to do?

1264
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,500
Nothing.

1265
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,100
I guess.

1266
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,700
So let's set up the motivating situation.

1267
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,300
I'm not going to use color and Alpha and that sort of things, I'm just

1268
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,300
going to maybe use.

1269
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,600
Well, you know what I will use, I'll use C4 color and I'll use a for

1270
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,000
Alpha, right?

1271
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,200
And so we have several of these things coming in.

1272
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,900
So we've got two of them.

1273
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,500
Let's say we've got C, 0,

1274
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,700
A 0, right?

1275
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:39,800
And then I've got that's going to be like bitmap one.

1276
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Right then I've got C 0 c 1 a 1 and that's going to be bitmap too.

1277
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,000
Right.

1278
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I guess I should say bitmap zero didn't have one, right?

1279
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,100
And then I've got sort of the screen.

1280
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,300
What was on the screen?

1281
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,100
I've got see screen.

1282
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,000
A well, we don't have an a screen, so that's just what's on the

1283
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,900
screen, the screen buffer.

1284
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,100
And then I've got the intermediate buffer, right?

1285
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,500
So I've got see, whatever the intimate, we'll just call that b for.

1286
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,200
Now, write Alpha buffer and this is that, that buffer intermediate,

1287
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:25,400
So, if we look at what happens for the screen blend, right?

1288
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,300
That we know exactly what that value should be.

1289
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,700
And that's the motivation we're going to use.

1290
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,900
So if I was to draw a bitmap 0, on top of bitmap, I'm sorry, bitmap,

1291
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,200
one on top of bitmap zero, right?

1292
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,300
Then I know what we want to have on the screen, so the first step of

1293
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,600
that, right?

1294
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:49,500
The see screen, the first step of that I'll call that maybe see screen

1295
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,300
Prime for now, because we're going to do two steps compute it.

1296
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,400
The first thing for see screen, the screen won't have anything in it,

1297
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,700
so it's just going to be that blending remember.

1298
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:05,800
The blending equation is 1, minus Alpha times, dest plus Source,

1299
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,300
right?

1300
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,700
That's the premultiplied equation that we worked out before.

1301
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,100
So, that's what we're doing in here, right?

1302
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,700
So the color we know is going to be 1, minus Alpha times desk, but

1303
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,399
there's nothing in the destination yet, it's empty, right?

1304
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,399
So we want myself a times dest plus, whatever the source color

1305
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,600
actually is right.

1306
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,500
Whatever that that Source color actually is okay.

1307
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,399
And so that's going to just be, that's just going to be color 0,

1308
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,700
that's going to go straight in there.

1309
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,600
Because remember these are pre multiplied.

1310
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,700
So these are, these are

1311
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,100
These guys are already pre multiplied, right?

1312
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:42,700
As is this guy?

1313
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:46,700
So that's what's supposed to happen there.

1314
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,600
The next step to get CS, right?

1315
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:56,000
Is this is what's in the destination, that's this, right?

1316
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,800
So we're going to have one minus, whatever bitmap.

1317
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,500
Alpha is we're going to have one minus Alpha One.

1318
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,000
Gosh, darn it.

1319
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,899
Man, the pain is killing me today.

1320
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,800
We're going to have one minus, whatever that Alpha is times, what was

1321
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,399
in the destination, right?

1322
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,399
Which is C 0.

1323
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:21,700
And then we want to add to it, whatever our source was stream has

1324
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,100
ended.

1325
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,500
No it hasn't I beg to differ.

1326
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,300
We're going to add to it, whatever our source was and that source is

1327
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,800
C1, right?

1328
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,000
Like so

1329
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,899
So that's what's in the screen at the end of this process.

1330
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:42,200
When we look at what that is, we can actually kind of see this is is

1331
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:46,899
what we wanted that Alpha to be right, I believe.

1332
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,200
Yeah, it's 1.

1333
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:55,600
Minus alpha 1 is what we would expect to see do everything right here.

1334
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,200
CS C 0.

1335
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:05,600
Yeah, looks to me like, yeah, coz Alpha 0 is not involved because what

1336
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,400
was in this room is not.

1337
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,800
I wonder if you have to do one more stage of this, to get it.

1338
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,800
That's unfortunate because now that, I think, yeah, well, okay, we'll

1339
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,100
see.

1340
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,900
So, we want that to equal this, right?

1341
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:18,300
This is the, this is the end goal, right?

1342
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,700
If I haven't made a mistake there.

1343
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,100
So that's the end goal.

1344
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,000
Now, what happens when we build that, that, that free buffer.

1345
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,300
So we go through and we do this in two stages, this would actually be

1346
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:36,000
the color that's in the buffer at the end of things, right?

1347
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,600
If that makes sense.

1348
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,500
So this is CB as well, right?

1349
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:46,400
CB, if we did two steps of alpha, blending would also be this.

1350
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,500
So when we then go to draw to the screen, right?

1351
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:57,000
We're going to go through another another pass, so RC screen when

1352
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,100
we're using the buffer, right?

1353
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,100
RC screen, if we're using the buffer fact I could basically do that

1354
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,100
this is going to be in there.

1355
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,300
So RC screen we want to be equal to this, right?

1356
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,300
This is the Target that we want it to be equal to

1357
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,900
at the end but what it's going to actually it's going to go through

1358
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:21,700
the equation 1 - the buffers Alpha whatever is in that what?

1359
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:28,500
Oops, sorry 1 minus the buffers Alpha, right, times whatever was in

1360
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
the screen to begin with, right?

1361
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,900
Which we know in this case,

1362
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,700
All right, man.

1363
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,600
I'm too sleepy today.

1364
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,300
So in order to actually do this correctly, right?

1365
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,200
I've got to actually have something in that screen to begin with is

1366
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,200
the problem because as I got down there I'm like okay that term goes

1367
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,000
out to 0 and then I can't show anything.

1368
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:57,000
So, alright, let's try that one more time, right?

1369
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,200
These are pre multiplied.

1370
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,900
Okay, and this has got to be multiplied as well.

1371
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,200
One more time.

1372
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,200
So we have to assume that there's something in the screen to begin

1373
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,900
with and so yeah.

1374
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,200
Like we're going to have to change the nomenclature.

1375
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,400
So we want a result screen, right?

1376
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:22,900
This is the this is the result, let's say or I should say color

1377
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,700
result, we're doing that.

1378
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,500
So this is the result we actually want

1379
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:29,600
Okay.

1380
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,300
Alright, one more time.

1381
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,300
So, the result we want.

1382
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:43,200
Is going to be the process of doing those Blends, right?

1383
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,300
So it's a French, it's going to basically be if we if we imagined our

1384
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,300
lerp here, right?

1385
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,400
Our blend equation or whatever.

1386
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:54,600
It's going to be a blend of whatever.

1387
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:59,100
The, the thing that is, that's in the screen right now, right?

1388
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,000
We'll do dest, will do.

1389
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,800
Well, let's do Source test.

1390
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,500
So it's going to be a blend of c0.

1391
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:17,000
Percy one on top of a blend of c0 on the screen, right?

1392
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,000
So, whatever is on the screen at the moment, right?

1393
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,400
So expanding that out.

1394
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,200
And again, our blend, right?

1395
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,200
Our blend for source, and desk equals.

1396
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:33,600
That one - The Source, the alpha for the source times, the

1397
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,600
The destination color because we're doing color destination, and that

1398
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,800
is plus, whatever the color of the source is right.

1399
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,200
So that's that blind equation that we're using.

1400
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,100
So if we expand that out, we get C.

1401
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,900
R equals the blend equation for color one.

1402
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:55,700
And man, it's hard to draw with this pen and then we're going to do

1403
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,700
this equation for that back part.

1404
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,800
So we get 1, minus the alpha of the source and again this is source

1405
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,400
dest.

1406
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,500
So that's going to be

1407
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,400
Alpha 0.

1408
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:10,000
And that's going to then be times the color of the screen, the color

1409
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,100
of the destination plus that Source color so C 0, right?

1410
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,400
So that's the blend.

1411
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,900
So the result we want out one more step.

1412
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,000
We've got the Blends now.

1413
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,800
So out one more step.

1414
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,900
The blend is going to be again, same equation.

1415
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:31,100
It's going to be 1, minus the source Alpha, and again, this is the

1416
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:31,900
source, right?

1417
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:37,000
So Alpha 1 times that destination color and that's the destination

1418
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,600
color there, right?

1419
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:41,300
So, we've got 1, minus a 0,

1420
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,700
CS + C 0.

1421
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,200
Right.

1422
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,100
And then that's going to be plus, whatever that sorts color was,

1423
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:51,500
right.

1424
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:57,700
So that's going to be plus that that color one.

1425
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,100
Right.

1426
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:02,000
Do that, right?

1427
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,300
See my say, think that's right.

1428
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,200
Yeah, put the link, okay?

1429
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:11,600
So that's what we're looking at, right?

1430
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,000
And you can see that the result here, right?

1431
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,800
If we were to multiply this out a little bit more, let's just, let's

1432
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,900
just group the terms, right?

1433
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,400
So 1 minus a 1.

1434
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,500
We if we do the distribution inside here we would get CS minus a 0 C,

1435
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,700
s+ C 0.

1436
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:36,500
Write plus C1 like, so, and so, if we were again to multiply out

1437
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,000
again, it's going to get super ugly.

1438
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,700
I might even check the stream for catching my math are as because I'm

1439
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,800
very bad at multiplying out things like this.

1440
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,700
I think I've said that many times on stream.

1441
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,400
It's true.

1442
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,200
CS minus a 0 C.

1443
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,600
S+ C 0, right?

1444
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:59,800
And then we've got - at the - a one version of that, right?

1445
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:13,000
So we've got minus A 1 C S Plus a 0 A 1 C s+ oops sorry minus A 1 C 0

1446
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,900
multiplied out plus C1 right?

1447
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,700
So now if we group the terms

1448
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:27,700
If we group the terms together, we can kind of, see, I guess what?

1449
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:28,100
You know.

1450
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:33,400
We can see this a little more clearly if we group the terms by their

1451
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,800
Alphas, which is what I was kind of hoping do you can see, there's two

1452
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,300
bear colors.

1453
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,400
Here are sorry three bear colors here, right?

1454
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,800
So all of the colors themselves get added in eventually, right?

1455
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,200
You've got you've got a CS well, you know what, maybe we should group

1456
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,000
them by maybe I should just group them by color.

1457
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,000
Now that I think about it, that seems like a smarter way to analyze

1458
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,800
this, right?

1459
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,700
So if I group them by bye,

1460
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,800
Yes, right.

1461
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,200
My CS term would be 1 minus Alpha 0, right?

1462
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,500
That's the Cs term here.

1463
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:13,000
CS term here.

1464
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,500
Minus out a one myself, a one.

1465
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,000
Plus.

1466
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,600
A 0, a 1, right?

1467
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,000
Those are the terms that are on there.

1468
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:32,900
One minus a0 A1, minus a0, minus A1, Plus that right?

1469
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:39,700
Then if I group for my C, 0 term is a 0 term is just is just 1, minus

1470
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,400
a 1, right?

1471
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:45,000
And then my see, one term is just see one.

1472
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,300
There's nothing happened to because it was the last guy on top, right.

1473
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,000
And so I can pull that up a little bit further as well.

1474
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,300
I can say CS, if I look at this, this thing here, you've got the sort

1475
01:17:59,300 --> 01:17:59,600
of

1476
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,200
Well, I guess, I don't know if there's any real reason to pull that

1477
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,100
out but you can kind of see if I was to pull out.

1478
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:12,800
The I could I could do sort of an in a 01 pull out or thing here.

1479
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,600
I don't know, it doesn't look like there's anything, actually all that

1480
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,300
you sort of pull out here but this is what the result should be,

1481
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,300
right?

1482
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,000
This is what the result, I actually want to get, right?

1483
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:29,200
So, let's take a look at what happens when I actually am.

1484
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,200
Going to make you produce this buffer.

1485
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,100
So,

1486
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:34,600
I want to get this out.

1487
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,500
This kind of super gnarly Ridiculousness that I've got here, right?

1488
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:43,500
I want to get this out and I have this equation to work with, right?

1489
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:48,800
So, what we're going to do at some point at the end of the pipeline is

1490
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,400
we're going to apply this equation, right?

1491
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,800
Blend source.

1492
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:57,700
Dest and the source and desk is going to be my pre composite buffer,

1493
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,200
right?

1494
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,800
So this is going to be the source.

1495
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,900
I want to blend that Source color.

1496
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,700
That buffer color with the screen right with cs.

1497
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,200
And somehow using that right?

1498
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,400
Which is is going to be equal to that blind equation.

1499
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,800
Which is you know one - whatever that that Alpha is for the buffer.

1500
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,200
This is the thing that we don't know, right?

1501
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:31,200
One - A B times the color that's on the screen I want to to have that

1502
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,800
plus that that input color from the buffer.

1503
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,700
I want to have this magically equal this.

1504
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,800
Right somehow.

1505
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,700
Now, we know that the color from the buffer basically has to

1506
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:47,900
encapsulate these terms.

1507
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,500
Right?

1508
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,300
Because the color, the zip, the color from the first bitmap and from

1509
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:58,200
the 0th bitmap in the first bitmap, that's not represented anywhere in

1510
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:02,900
the screens thing so that has to be come through entirely here.

1511
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,800
Now that's the trivial part because we already knew that that's what

1512
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,900
the buffer is color was going to be right.

1513
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,800
We or a disk just a blend that all that is that the blend equation for

1514
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,500
c 1 + 4 c 1 over C 0.

1515
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,700
So we already have that, right?

1516
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,600
That's just

1517
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,100
This right here we already knew that that was what that was.

1518
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,400
We didn't really have to do anything there.

1519
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,600
We already knew that's what that was right.

1520
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,200
So RC B term is exactly what we thought it was.

1521
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:36,100
It's just one - whatever the incoming Source Alpha is, right?

1522
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,900
So the source Alpha times, the depth color plus the source color,

1523
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,600
right?

1524
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,300
That's exactly what that is.

1525
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,700
There's the source color.

1526
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,500
There's the source Alpha, there's the desk color, right?

1527
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:48,600
So,

1528
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:49,500
It's exactly right.

1529
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,000
So we know CB, we did it correctly.

1530
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,200
It's exactly what we want.

1531
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,100
The question is, what do we do with this nonsense up here, right?

1532
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,800
For our, for our source.

1533
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:06,300
This is what that says, so this suggests that the equation for

1534
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,700
producing RAB, right?

1535
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,100
Is we're saying this term cscs.

1536
01:21:13,100 --> 01:21:15,500
We need this to reproduce that.

1537
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,900
We need one - a bee

1538
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:22,200
To somehow reproduce this Ridiculousness right here.

1539
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:31,400
We that to produce 1 minus a 0 minus a 1 plus a 0, a 1 right solving

1540
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,200
for that.

1541
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:40,900
What we would get is 1, minus a b equals 1 minus a0, minus A1 Plus a

1542
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,000
0, a 1, right?

1543
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,900
We want to solve for a b.

1544
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:48,700
So we got - a b equals

1545
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,900
Of course, the one is subtracted now so that removes that one, right?

1546
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:57,700
So we just end up, we get rid of those two, we get a 0, minus a 1,

1547
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:02,600
sorry minus a 0, minus a 1 plus a 0, a 1

1548
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:10,800
and we want to negate both sides, so we get a bee right equals a0 plus

1549
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,100
A1, minus a0 A1

1550
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:21,100
and yes after an hour of math, ladies and gentlemen we come to the

1551
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:23,700
equation for the premultiplied alpha that will give us the result that

1552
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:28,900
we want which is a 0 plus a 1, minus a 0, a 1 star,

1553
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,200
If Casey.

1554
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:38,300
Didn't make a typo, didn't make a, don't know what you call that math.

1555
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:39,800
oh,

1556
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:42,500
which I almost always do.

1557
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,800
But that would be assuming that we worked out the math properly,

1558
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,700
that's what that was.

1559
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,100
And you saw how I did that there, right?

1560
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:52,700
It was a ton of writing but there was nothing complicated.

1561
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,100
All I did was just say, if we were to do this procedure that we'd

1562
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,900
worked out by hand a couple of times, and we just let the math flow

1563
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,700
through it, what comes out the other end, right?

1564
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,600
And the answer is that, and if we were to type that in, right,

1565
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:15,100
All that saying is all right, the result for the alpha and we have

1566
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,700
that sort of space issue here where we're going to multiply these two

1567
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,200
things together.

1568
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:20,200
So we actually need to be able to do.

1569
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,900
We actually need to be able to do some slightly more complicated stuff

1570
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,200
here.

1571
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,000
So,

1572
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,000
Excuse me, this C Alpha complicates our life a little bit.

1573
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:37,100
If you know what I mean, because we haven't thought about what happens

1574
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:42,000
if we need to sort of introduce this additional blend in there because

1575
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,800
what we really would need to do is since this is premultiplied Alpha,

1576
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,300
now that see Alpha is going to have to be accounted for.

1577
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:53,200
But let's let's let's ignore that for one second.

1578
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,400
So let's do to do Casey put C Alpha back in

1579
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,200
Right.

1580
01:23:58,700 --> 01:23:59,100
Okay.

1581
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,600
So because we were only using that to modulate our shadows.

1582
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:09,100
But anyway, so let's say we're going to actually try to implement this

1583
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:09,600
now.

1584
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:16,100
So now if we if we imagine ourselves having both of the alphas being

1585
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,400
the 10 space, you can actually work with them, as simple, floating

1586
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,600
Point values, right?

1587
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,600
Then we have this equation, it's a zero.

1588
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:31,500
So that's sa right plus d a

1589
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,400
I did this rock fat right already?

1590
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,200
A, there we go.

1591
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:42,700
So it's our essay.

1592
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:50,100
Plus our da, plus the two of them times each other or I sorry - the

1593
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:52,000
two of them times each other.

1594
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,800
That's the actual Alpha in 0 to 1 space.

1595
01:24:55,400 --> 01:25:01,100
And then, so, if we need that to go back up into 55 space, it would

1596
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,000
look like that, right?

1597
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,200
So again, the thesaurus, the dest, and then subtract the two of them

1598
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,900
multiply together, right?

1599
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,300
I don't know if that makes some sense and so that is the

1600
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:18,800
Two equation that we would want for our destination Alpha and as you

1601
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:25,700
can see also it produces those nice non darkened edges now and

1602
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:30,500
everything works correctly everywhere, it would appear right?

1603
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:37,300
Although we do have now the issue of C Alpha, which we need to to fix.

1604
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,400
All right.

1605
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:43,400
So let's go ahead and and re-enable or Draw test ground stuff.

1606
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:46,600
Just so we can see what's going on there.

1607
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:54,500
So let's go ahead and turn that back on like so, and I guess our grass

1608
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,000
Tufts, we're still always in there.

1609
01:25:57,300 --> 01:26:00,300
So now we're compositing with premultiplied Alpha properly which means

1610
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:05,900
our edges are all handled correctly and you can kind of see that, you

1611
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,400
know, looking nice in there.

1612
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,100
Of course, we do still have hard edges here, but that's to be

1613
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:10,400
expected.

1614
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,400
That's just clipping, right?

1615
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,200
Our bitmap.

1616
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,900
That's this is the whole size of our bitmap.

1617
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:14,300
So,

1618
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:16,700
There's nothing we can really do about that when we're actually

1619
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,300
reducing these should we're going to let them keep going on the sea,

1620
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:19,800
right?

1621
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,200
So that's proper and we can also go back to doing our draw test ground

1622
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,200
only that one time, right?

1623
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:34,900
So now we're back to full speed as well and everything is good.

1624
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:38,400
So that was an extremely long Meander.

1625
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,400
But we needed to talk about premultiplied Alpha at some point.

1626
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,000
And now we have and, you know, the pre

1627
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,100
At Alpha is now working properly for us.

1628
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,100
And we don't have those dark fringes on our bitmaps, which is what we

1629
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:51,400
want too bad.

1630
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:54,500
The pain didn't work the whole time, but what you going to do,

1631
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,800
sometimes the worst things happen at the worst times and that

1632
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:06,100
I guess the motto of Microsoft Windows when might say, okay, so that

1633
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,800
means we can go ahead and get rid of our someday.

1634
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,400
Talk about premultiplied Alpha because we just did.

1635
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,900
And now we are also at least as far as we know, if I didn't make a

1636
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:20,800
math, are doing the alpha correctly there, but we want to put in this

1637
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,700
C Alpha.

1638
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:26,700
Now to put in that c Alpha remember all of our Alpha now has to be

1639
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,500
premultiplied, right?

1640
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And what that means is that this C Alpha is an actual is a new

1641
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
premultiplication term.

1642
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,100
We have to put in there, right?

1643
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,300
And so when we compute the alpha here and we do if we multiply that c

1644
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,100
Alpha in like we were doing to sort of add an additional modulation so

1645
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:50,600
that we can make things be less trans you can be more transparent than

1646
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:51,800
they would ordinarily be.

1647
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,700
What we have to do, is we have to take these colors and also multiply

1648
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:00,000
them, right?

1649
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,300
We see Alpha has to multiply everything because everything needs to be

1650
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:05,600
pre multiplied.

1651
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:09,200
So that is, you know, necessary.

1652
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,100
If we want our pre multiplication to come to work, and you can kind of

1653
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:18,800
see now, our shadows are back to sort of modulating based on height,

1654
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,200
like they were doing before, right?

1655
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,400
All right, so that was not the way I would have liked to have done

1656
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:26,700
that.

1657
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,500
I would have liked to have had a working pen that whole time.

1658
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,800
But there you go and that is literally like I didn't know that

1659
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:36,800
equation ahead of time.

1660
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:39,000
I mean, I think I probably knew it one.

1661
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,100
I mean I probably have used it once or twice when I've been writing

1662
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,700
some bitmap code, right?

1663
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,400
But I literally figured that out on the stream, totally honest.

1664
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,300
I did not look it up beforehand.

1665
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,200
So that is what it looks like literally when I need to figure out an

1666
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,500
equation, right?

1667
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,700
And so if you go back and think about the steps that I went through,

1668
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:04,600
It's kind of good to internalize them work through some examples

1669
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,300
first, like, see what the process is and make kind of a little Tableau

1670
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:14,700
if you will of here's the process that we go through, right then go,

1671
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,500
okay I see what's happening in the process.

1672
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,900
And again I shouldn't say it's not like figuring out that

1673
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,500
premultiplied Alpha is the thing.

1674
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,600
I knew that was a thing, right?

1675
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,400
And figuring out, premultiplied Alpha is like hey you're a rocket

1676
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,500
scientist or something, right.

1677
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:33,100
The people who figure out premultiplied Alpha and that it was

1678
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:33,500
important.

1679
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,700
That took a lot of people, a lot of time and looking at things to do,

1680
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:36,900
right?

1681
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,500
So not that but I'm just talking about, you know, there's a thing that

1682
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,300
you want.

1683
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,800
How do you get, how do you get the math out for it, right?

1684
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,800
And so, working through the examples, that's the first thing.

1685
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,200
Seeing how they should go.

1686
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,600
It gets you warmed up and it kind of gives you something, you know,

1687
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,800
that you have to match and then just seeing, can you write the

1688
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,600
equations so that things just flow through the equations.

1689
01:29:59,600 --> 01:29:59,800
So you

1690
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,700
Solve for the value that you want and then you know that is obviously

1691
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,600
the most rate for a path in the easiest one to do.

1692
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,100
Sometimes, you can't do that and then things, get more complicated but

1693
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:09,700
assuming you can.

1694
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:12,100
That's what you go and then you end up with hopefully the right

1695
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:12,700
answer.

1696
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,100
What we really probably should do here.

1697
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,800
Is is actually check the math, right?

1698
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,400
Go back and plug some things in, and make sure that it works out the

1699
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:26,800
way that we wanted if we didn't have any way of checking it.

1700
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:28,400
Otherwise, that's what we should do.

1701
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:34,300
What we could do is like destination Alpha equation for premultiplied

1702
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:38,800
Alpha and just check ours versus someone else's.

1703
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:47,100
But I don't know if there's really any way to find that out.

1704
01:30:49,900 --> 01:30:52,200
If that makes sense, what we really want.

1705
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,800
Is like Sean Barrett's article on premultiplied Alpha.

1706
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,600
So yeah, maybe I won't do that now because we're kind of, we've

1707
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,800
already been quite long.

1708
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,200
So, yeah.

1709
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:07,100
So what we need to do like the last step is we need to go like check

1710
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:11,700
this for math errors, because like I said, often times when I work

1711
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:15,600
through math like that, I can't just assume the result that I got was

1712
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,600
correct because oftentimes, I will make a mistake.

1713
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,400
And so, what you want to do is you want to go through and like, retest

1714
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,200
the equation,

1715
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,200
Using the examples that you work through before and make sure they get

1716
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:32,300
the right answers that you think you should have gotten and also

1717
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,400
obviously, if other people have worked it out beforehand, go check

1718
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,500
against there's etc.

1719
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,000
Etc.

1720
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,600
And you might ask the question well why would you re work out an

1721
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,500
equation that someone else already worked out?

1722
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,300
And the answer is because if you don't practice working out equations

1723
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,100
that other people have already worked out, you're never going to be

1724
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:51,100
able to work out equations that other people haven't worked out.

1725
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,900
And so especially on simple cases like that where it's not.

1726
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Hard to work them through.

1727
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,400
You should work them through and until you start getting the point

1728
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,400
where you can do them reasonably well, right.

1729
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:06,600
And if you're lucky, you're better at with math than I am and you

1730
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,600
don't make as many careless errors when you're working through the

1731
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,600
equations, right?

1732
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,500
Because some people are much better at math than I am and they, that,

1733
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,700
you know, that's a big help to.

1734
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,800
You can also use a computer algebra system to do it, you know, like,

1735
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,600
you could plug it into Wolfram Alpha or Mathematica if you have that

1736
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,800
or Matlab sometimes those have symbolic solvers in,

1737
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,300
Them.

1738
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:29,400
And that can help you check or actually just do the the math all

1739
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:29,500
through.

1740
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,700
So, once you've set up the problem properly, you can have it chug

1741
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:33,700
through it for you and produce the result.

1742
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,900
So that's pretty good.

1743
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,100
All right, let's go ahead and do the Q&A Q&A.

1744
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:48,100
So if anyone has any questions quickly, we've got about, let's let's

1745
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,200
we can do some quick questions before ending the Stream.

1746
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:57,300
And let's see if there's any questions out there.

1747
01:32:59,400 --> 01:32:59,800
It's too bad.

1748
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,800
In him 73 isn't here today.

1749
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:08,900
Because I'm I'm kind of I think he's the resident math expert and so

1750
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:12,100
he could tell me if I had he would have caught any any errors.

1751
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,100
According to a link, they posted to fix the Wacom driver without

1752
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:27,800
restarting stop and start Wacom, professional tablet service.

1753
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:29,700
Okay.

1754
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:42,300
Wacom.

1755
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,500
Professional tablet service.

1756
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,600
Stop the service.

1757
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,700
Start the service.

1758
01:33:55,700 --> 01:34:00,200
Okay, I have done so and maybe I will plug in the tablet again.

1759
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,700
Just to give it a fair shot there.

1760
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:06,600
And let's see.

1761
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:10,900
That did absolutely nothing.

1762
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,600
You can try reloading, mischief.

1763
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,000
Now that that did not help.

1764
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,200
Unfortunately.

1765
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,200
I'm assuming that if I reboot the machine, it'll help.

1766
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,300
Of course, that'll kill the stream.

1767
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,300
Oh, now, there we go.

1768
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,800
So it did help it.

1769
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,700
Just Mischief had to be rebooted because maybe Mischief, didn't think.

1770
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,300
Oh, no.

1771
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,300
It worked for a second there and then it seems like Windows like

1772
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:39,400
overrode it.

1773
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:43,500
Oh no, it's working.

1774
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,000
I don't know.

1775
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:46,900
Okay yeah, okay.

1776
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:47,900
It is definitely working.

1777
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:49,300
Cool.

1778
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,300
Thank you very much for that.

1779
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,500
That was very helpful.

1780
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,300
Being happy sleepy and Sneezy.

1781
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,900
Do you realize you do realize you're just for dwarf?

1782
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:07,200
Sort of a cult crew?

1783
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:12,000
Well actually, I would say I'm grumpy sleepy and Sneezy.

1784
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:20,800
Because honestly that tablet thing like I had to do all this math with

1785
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,700
a nonworking tablet was pretty annoying.

1786
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:29,600
I mean, that's a lot of drawing, it was a Blackboard episode today so

1787
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:35,400
like on days when we do a Blackboard episode, I kind of wanted to have

1788
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:41,000
the Blackboard working that seems like a pretty reasonable thing to

1789
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,600
ask for but you know

1790
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,700
Nowadays.

1791
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,100
Nothing works.

1792
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,100
Reliably.

1793
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,000
Anymore.

1794
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:08,700
Mr.

1795
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:09,900
Fourth dimension.

1796
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,900
So if I understand correctly, sorry if my interpretation just confuse

1797
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,600
anyone, but the reason off-screen rendering was incorrect before,

1798
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,400
premultiplied Alpha.

1799
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,100
Was that after blending things in the texture, the colors there were

1800
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,900
pre multiplied because they were multiplied when they were put in the

1801
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:23,400
texture.

1802
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,700
If, for some reason, you didn't want to optimize your code, you could

1803
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:30,300
also divide the color Channel by the alpha to get it back to unfree

1804
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:31,100
multiplied.

1805
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,800
Is this a reasonable understanding of the issue?

1806
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:42,000
So it's more that you can't really make the math, work out properly

1807
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,500
without the multiplication being in being pre multiplied, right?

1808
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:55,900
the problem is actually a little bit deeper, it's that

1809
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,700
trying to think of what the right way to say it would be

1810
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,500
It's the way that Sean Barrett typically says it and really like if

1811
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,400
you want the full technical explanation, he's the guy the way he

1812
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:18,500
pretty usually says it is something like, you know, non premultiplied

1813
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,100
Alpha.

1814
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,100
Wish we had a better term for it, we multiply it Alpha.

1815
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,300
Does not distribute.

1816
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:33,900
Over linear interpolation.

1817
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,700
I think that's the way he normally says it.

1818
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:49,700
And basically, what he's talking about is that if you want to Stack

1819
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,000
linear interpolations on top of each other, right?

1820
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:57,100
So I'm going to do you know that linear that blend equation, right?

1821
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:00,700
So I'm going to do a blend of a blend, right?

1822
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,900
or blends of Blends and so on, you know,

1823
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:08,800
right, I guess I probably shouldn't you whose

1824
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:14,300
Those x y z.

1825
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:15,400
He W.

1826
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,300
There we go.

1827
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,700
So if I'm going to do blends of Blends, right?

1828
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:28,100
You can't actually make the math work out properly because if you

1829
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:31,900
don't pre multiply the alpha, then the blend doesn't distribute,

1830
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:32,800
right?

1831
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:37,800
Meaning you can't actually compose Blends in arbitrary ways like this,

1832
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,200
unless the alpha is pre multiplied.

1833
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,700
So I believe that's how he usually phrases it.

1834
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,500
I've never really worked out.

1835
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,900
In fact, that's the first time.

1836
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,200
This right here is the first time I ever even solved this equation

1837
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,400
Right?

1838
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,200
The first time I've ever done it so I've never really thought about it

1839
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,700
too much Beyond just knowing that it was the right.

1840
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,600
Eek but I don't do that much work with it.

1841
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:06,300
In fact, recently was the first time, I think I ever even really

1842
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:11,700
actually used this knowledge in an actual blending thing.

1843
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,500
Not maybe I've done it once before but usually preserving destination

1844
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:17,900
Alpha.

1845
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,000
I don't do.

1846
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,700
So this is the first time I've ever really done that preserving

1847
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:22,500
destination Alpha.

1848
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:25,500
I think I've done it maybe one time before, but I've never actually

1849
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,500
worked it out all the way through like that.

1850
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,300
And so, there you go.

1851
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:35,100
But so I haven't really thought too deeply about the meaning of that,

1852
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:39,900
but that is what he was sort of talking about in.

1853
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:43,200
He's been advocating premultiplied Alpha for, you know, decades now.

1854
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:47,100
He's the person, he's the reason I originally even knew about

1855
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,500
premultiplied Alpha because actually for a long time game industry

1856
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,500
people didn't know about premultiplied Alpha and you get those black

1857
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:53,600
fringes on everything.

1858
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:56,900
There are old games where you actually get black fringes on the

1859
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:00,200
Sprites because they didn't do premultiplied alpha.

1860
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:05,100
And once mipmapping like, you know, mipmapping on graphics cards,

1861
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,700
mipmapping is a blend mipmapping.

1862
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,200
Well, it's not a blend, but

1863
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,600
I shouldn't say that.

1864
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:12,700
Bilinear filtering.

1865
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,500
You don't even need mipmapping, right?

1866
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,100
Bilateral.

1867
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:19,400
Bilinear filtering of textures like when you have textures and your

1868
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,800
sampling like there so that you get a blend of the four colors of the

1869
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,700
for texels.

1870
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,900
That's two of these, right?

1871
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:32,700
It's a, it's a blend between these two colors, these two colors.

1872
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,800
Then you blend the the two results together, you know, conceptually

1873
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:36,300
speaking.

1874
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:40,200
So it's a bunch of Blends and then that gets Blended to the

1875
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,000
Buffer.

1876
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:41,800
Right.

1877
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So you have this series of Blends that goes on with texture filtering

1878
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,900
and then that and you would get these black fringes on your Sprites

1879
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:52,800
and the reason is because you need in order to have this work out

1880
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,800
properly, if you're doing that lerp, if you're just using that linear

1881
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:01,200
interpolation over and over again you need it to distribute properly

1882
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,800
right now like you you like you kind of hint to that with your

1883
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,500
question.

1884
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:10,000
You could always probably make the math work out by like really, like

1885
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,700
you said like re dividing every time

1886
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:18,600
So you try to reconstruct what the color was, it seems like that

1887
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:24,400
should work out and probably the reason that you never actually do it

1888
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:29,700
that way in practice is because like you're working with Hardware that

1889
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:34,600
does this sort of stuff and you don't have the opportunity to go in

1890
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,100
there and tell the hardware you want to do this redivide.

1891
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,000
Not only that, but like you said, the efficiency would be a problem.

1892
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,700
So I suspect that yes

1893
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:46,000
What you were saying is correct, you could just work out the math, the

1894
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,100
other way and constantly be doing more work to your colors to put them

1895
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,300
back into a space where they could blend properly.

1896
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:58,000
So like you said do a divide out, do the thing, put it back in.

1897
01:41:59,400 --> 01:41:59,700
but,

1898
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,900
Runs into problems because eventually you're going to have to be

1899
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,200
working with Hardware.

1900
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,300
That has some fixed notion of what those blend equations are.

1901
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,100
So even if you didn't care about performance, you're probably in

1902
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:13,700
trouble because you wouldn't kill do it now, maybe you could just turn

1903
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,300
off if you really didn't care about performance.

1904
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:18,700
Maybe you could still do it that way and just turn off the texture

1905
01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:22,500
filtering Hardware entirely and you just, you know, take samples

1906
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,200
yourself and do the Divide out and whatever.

1907
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,200
So it become tireli you just program it all.

1908
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,000
Do it all in shaders, right?

1909
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,800
Maybe that would work, but

1910
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,900
Typically you want to take advantage of that fast stuff as much as

1911
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,700
possible, so I don't know.

1912
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,400
See any other on-topic questions?

1913
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:56,400
Let's see, let's see.

1914
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,500
Can you give a small example of what the decompression step between

1915
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:04,400
Sim entity and stored entity will look like probably not because I

1916
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:05,800
don't know what it will look like yet.

1917
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,900
We're going to have to we're going to have to actually get there first

1918
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:14,500
and then see what we want it to look like based on based on the

1919
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,100
situation.

1920
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:26,700
Drive 137.

1921
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:30,000
Maybe we should set a way for you to see things like that.

1922
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,700
Kind of help if someone finds a good possible solution.

1923
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,100
No, I don't know how sorry.

1924
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:35,900
I drive 137.

1925
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:38,600
I'm not sure what that was in reference to

1926
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,200
Looks like we don't have any other.

1927
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:58,900
Questions here, math didn't screw math, dense streams tend to not have

1928
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:03,200
very many questions I feel like that means probably people don't pay

1929
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,500
very much attention to when I do the math workouts maybe I don't know

1930
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,400
or maybe everyone's much better at math than I am so they're just like

1931
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,800
yeah till they get it so we fine, we're done.

1932
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,000
So yeah, that's fine.

1933
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,900
Yeah, a lot of equation in today.

1934
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,200
We could all that, man.

1935
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,700
I wish to said been with the good pain.

1936
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:30,900
Now I know though, thank you for pointing out to me how to fix it so

1937
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:31,500
that's good.

1938
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:33,300
So

1939
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:38,600
So, you know, at least, at least now I know to start and stop the sir

1940
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:42,500
to start Andre stop and restart the service and then that fixes it.

1941
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:46,600
All right, so let's go ahead and wrap up the stream for today.

1942
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,600
We've got our premultiplied Alpha in there.

1943
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:52,200
We want to check this math for errors at some point to make sure that

1944
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:57,700
we've got it properly, but now we are doing pretty much everything

1945
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:58,600
that we needed to do.

1946
01:44:58,600 --> 01:44:59,800
So we pretty much got

1947
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,200
Free compositing working.

1948
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,900
Now again, we don't really have much of a use for that.

1949
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:07,800
Pre compositing at the moment because we this was kind of just an

1950
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,700
aside that we decided to go down because well because someone got ran

1951
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:14,000
over by a train if you want to be completely honest.

1952
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,200
That's that's basically the history of it.

1953
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:19,800
Someone got ran over by a train and so we decided to

1954
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,800
Go ahead and take a little diversion into some background compositing,

1955
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,000
and I think I'm pretty happy with how it came out.

1956
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:31,300
We learned about premultiplied Alpha and we fixed our pipeline to use

1957
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:31,400
it.

1958
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,800
So that's a good step when you actually need to do that.

1959
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,500
There's still a little bit more left in there that we got to talk

1960
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,900
about, like, gamma and stuff.

1961
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,800
But we'll deal with that when we get to the renderer.

1962
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,600
But yeah, so our compositing works and honestly it looks pretty good

1963
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,700
already even though there's no logic in here, so it's kind of random

1964
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:50,600
it actually, you know, like I've seen Game ground, textures that look

1965
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:50,800
worse.

1966
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,400
The mat, to be completely honest with you.

1967
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:57,700
So I think that's that's pretty good that validates my assumption that

1968
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:01,700
basically, when we start to do Logic for how we want the ground to be

1969
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,600
laid out, I think it's going to work, just fine and composite

1970
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,400
properly, so that's that's pretty good.

1971
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,200
So hey, that was a good unknown that we got cleared up.

1972
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,700
I'm pretty happy about that.

1973
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:16,400
So, starting next week.

1974
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,400
We should go clean up finish cleaning up our closing detector.

1975
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:25,700
I suppose I may be maybe prematurely close to this.

1976
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:28,200
I should probably grab up our to do list here.

1977
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:33,800
So next week, I think will be the week that we finish out Z so what

1978
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:37,100
I'd like to do next week is kind of get our Z worked out again where

1979
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:41,900
we kind of have grounds and stuff properly done and just kind of have

1980
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,300
a relatively stable idea of what's going on there.

1981
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:47,400
So that we don't have any more confusion about that.

1982
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,800
So next week, I think let's go ahead and finish up the Z.

1983
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:56,300
And then the week after that, I think we should go ahead and tackle

1984
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:56,900
the clintus.

1985
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:02,400
I think we want to do this exactly as we kind of were doing it before

1986
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:05,200
and then multiple SIM regions per frame.

1987
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,900
Yeah, I mean, I would basically say that this is the hard stuff right

1988
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:09,400
here.

1989
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,800
So I'd say we want to probably go ahead and try to just bear down for

1990
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:14,500
a couple more weeks and finish up all that.

1991
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:18,900
And then I think we're in pretty good shape to just go ahead and

1992
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:21,500
cruise through all of these things here which are much more

1993
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,200
straightforward.

1994
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:22,600
These are

1995
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,600
A pretty wrote.

1996
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,600
They don't involve a lot of experimentation.

1997
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,400
They're pretty straightforward.

1998
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,300
There's, there's really not a lot to them.

1999
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:32,300
This is mainly just a lot of code typing in, right?

2000
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,100
Because they're very, very straight forward thing.

2001
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,100
So I think we'll kind of sail through those pretty pretty cleanly.

2002
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:42,000
Yeah, and that should be about that.

2003
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:46,300
Now, looking at how we do this, you know, I'm just kind of seeing how

2004
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,800
we're probably want to go through things.

2005
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,200
Animation AI, this is definitely.

2006
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:58,700
So I would say we probably have, you know, we probably have

2007
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Something.

2008
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:07,000
Yeah, I mean looking at it, this way, this this probably looks roughly

2009
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,700
like how will tackle them in order to?

2010
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:09,300
I don't know.

2011
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,900
I mean like I said I don't really make schedules too much so we'll

2012
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:15,100
tackle them in whatever order they come up but just looking at the

2013
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,200
things that we want to do.

2014
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:22,700
It looks like this probably isn't you know isn't isn't really too far

2015
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,000
off.

2016
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,700
I think this looks basically what we'll go ahead and what we'll be

2017
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:27,500
doing to get to production.

2018
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:29,900
It looks looks pretty reasonable.

2019
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Well and so you know, we'll go ahead and we'll we'll push through some

2020
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,900
of this hard stuff.

2021
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,900
We'll get our debug code working so that everything from then on we'll

2022
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:40,000
kind of have a nice set to it.

2023
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:42,900
This probably needs we haven't talked about fonts here.

2024
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:46,200
So we're going to need fonts

2025
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,700
Because otherwise we're not going to do any debug code.

2026
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,100
So yeah.

2027
01:48:51,100 --> 01:48:54,200
So I think this looks relatively you know I think this looks

2028
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,600
relatively good, I'm pretty happy with it.

2029
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,300
So next week we'll probably go and try the new time slot like I was

2030
01:49:01,300 --> 01:49:06,000
talking about I'd like to I'd like to maybe try doing some 5 p.m.

2031
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,000
eastern Daylight Time stream.

2032
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,300
So I think we'll do five p.m.

2033
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,500
slot next week and see how that goes.

2034
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,100
See how much of a problem it creates for people who are on the west

2035
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:14,300
coast?

2036
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:15,900
I think everyone else is probably pretty.

2037
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:17,700
Okay with it.

2038
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,600
But West Coast.

2039
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:20,900
It's a little more problematic because it's close to work time.

2040
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:25,600
But we're going to we're going to go ahead and see how that goes as a

2041
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,700
little bit of a test I think.

2042
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,300
And we'll make a call from an after that.

2043
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,600
Anyway, as always, if you would like to pre-order the game and follow

2044
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:35,600
along with the source code at home because it comes with all the

2045
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,600
source code, you can do that at handmade hero dot-org and use the pre

2046
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,700
order button to do that.

2047
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,800
It again comes to the link, you can use to Everyday, download the

2048
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,300
source code that I've been working on so you can play around with it

2049
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:46,700
yourself.

2050
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,600
At home and that's a good way to learn from it.

2051
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:51,600
Obviously you have a patreon page if you want to support the video

2052
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:55,500
series, we have a news and Forum site that you can go to for asking

2053
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:58,200
questions or getting ports to other platforms things like that.

2054
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,400
There's an episode guide on there.

2055
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:03,100
There's also the tweetbot which sends out the schedule which is Handy.

2056
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:05,500
If you want to know what the schedule is going to be check that tweet

2057
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:10,800
that out and we should be back here at 5:00 p.m.

2058
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:16,300
eastern Daylight time, sorry, pacific daylight time on Monday.

2059
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:16,700
So I

2060
01:50:16,900 --> 01:50:18,900
See you all there to try out the new timeslot.

2061
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:22,900
We'll see how it goes or if it's a giant Panic, we will see.

2062
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,300
So I hope to see you there have a great weekend and enjoy the pre

2063
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:28,700
multiplication of it all.

2064
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:32,400
Enjoy your premultiplied weekend brought to you courtesy of hanneman

2065
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:32,800
