00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
Start recording.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,900
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,300
The show we could a complete game live on stream today.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,300
We are going to look a little bit more closely at our particle system

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,200
code, which we sort of put in and actually it's all working.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,700
Now it didn't take us very long, I guess to put that in there so

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,500
that's good and all.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,100
But we've got a bunch more work to do.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,600
There's the vegetables he's there and there's something I'm really

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,200
afraid about and we'll have to kind of talk about it a little bit and

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,700
figure out what we're going to do about it.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,200
It's

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,200
Sort of, just another aspect of the 2D nests of the way we do things.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,700
So there's a little bit of the of the particle system stuff.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm not 100% sure what we're going to do about.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,400
But, you know, we've certainly, we have options.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
So it's not, it's not the end of the world, but we'll talk about that

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,900
a little bit, a little bit as well.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,900
So, let's just get right into it here.

20
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,600
Today is day, three thirty-nine.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,400
So, if you want to follow along at home, you want to use day, 338

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
source code.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,000
That's what I'm using today.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,200
So let me go ahead and open up.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,700
Our prayer.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,100
Okay, that's not what I wanted at all.

27
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,700
I've pushed the wrong file, there it is.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
So if

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,900
We go ahead.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
And run.

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,500
You can see that we sort of made this little thing that like, kicks

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,400
these little particles off when we when we sort of hit the ground

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,900
there and that's all fine.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,800
But we have sort of a little bit of a bug.

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,900
We haven't quite finished, getting this stuff working because we need

36
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,300
to make sure that when we move these particles, move properly with

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,900
changes in the camera.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,400
I like how this map still includes a boost square but I don't know

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,300
where it goes.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,700
We have this problem of like I guess we have sort of this the thing

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,200
that creates the world like still puts the blue square and even if

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,800
there is no way to boost to, I've no idea where it was trying to boost

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,600
to but that's not great you know not a good thing anyway.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,500
So if we go over to the other screen here, when we moved,

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Across from screen to screen our particles now like appear to do the

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
right thing.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
So that's good right?

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,100
I mean they're not, they're not obviously wrong, you know?

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:41,500
They they, they're somewhat correct, but what we found yesterday, when

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,900
we sort of slowed things down just to see, whether they were being

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,400
placed correctly, it did look like if you really pay close attention

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,300
to what happens to the particles during the transition, they are not

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,400
displaced the

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,400
way that we would expect, right?

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
So as I kind of

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,300
To the side here.

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,400
You'll notice that, as I move, you can pretty clearly see the

58
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,900
particles are getting a lot of slide to them.

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,600
That is not what we would expect.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,700
And so, I'm not really sure where that slide is coming from.

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,200
It would be a more understandable slide if it wasn't sinusoidal in

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,600
nature.

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,000
That's the part that really weirds me out about it.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,400
You can kind of see here as I move.

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,100
That the particles will shift first shift left in their cell and then

66
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,200
shift right in their cell, which does not make a whole lot of sense.

67
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,600
If this were strictly a perspective, like they were getting

68
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,900
transformed at the wrong perspective, kind of a problem, I would have

69
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,000
expected to see a more straightforward displacement problem.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Like either they're being displaced more slowly than the ground or

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,800
more quickly than the ground but not in a parent.

72
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Like sort of quicker and then slower, you know, inconsistent, if you

73
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,600
will.

74
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,000
Change.

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
That is not what I would have expected to see.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Now, the first thing I'm going to point out here is that in theory,

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,600
this should have nothing to do with our displacement, because the

78
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,300
displacement only happens with a camera actually moves.

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,400
It does not happen when the camera is simply just shifting.

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Because if you remember the way we implanted this as we shift the

81
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,100
camera first, then we actually move the Sim region in the center of

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,500
the camera over then we shift it.

83
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,600
So it's kind of like it's almost like a glorified screen shake the way

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,900
we do that so that we can sort of keep this notion

85
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,500
Of which room were centered on.

86
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,900
And then we just do this kind of displacement for moving the camera

87
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,200
there.

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
So, what I'm wondering is, I would just like to know if we didn't do

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
the frame displacement at all.

90
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,700
So let's say I did frame displacement and I just nullified it.

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,000
So now we're not adding that frame displacement at all I want to see

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,800
what actually happens when I go ahead and and shift, right?

93
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
so, as I move across,

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
So you can see that brake line there.

95
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
You see how like as I come across it, shifts back, right?

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,700
But you can see that that.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,100
Yeah.

98
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,700
It's it really does not require the frame displacement.

99
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,700
The frame displacement is strictly accounting, re realigning for that

100
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,600
camera shift.

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,700
You can see that the particles are shifting separate from that.

102
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,300
So it really is something to do with the way that they're getting

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,700
transformed separate from everything else.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,100
So we

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,000
know that it's not our frame displacement, that's to blame there.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,900
It's some other

107
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,000
Element.

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
And the frame displacement seems to be working properly.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
So I'd like to go ahead and see if I could figure it out.

110
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Figure out what is causing the other problem.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
With the Z there.

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Now one thing that's true is we're not setting the Z level properly

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,600
for our particles and again I'm not really sure exactly how we're

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
going to handle that.

115
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,200
One thing we could do is just make sure that we actually do sort our

116
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
particles into Z levels.

117
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,700
I'm nervous about doing these extra thing to particles because there's

118
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,400
a lot of them.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
So it makes me a little worried but you know, if we were going through

120
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,500
that, it's not particularly hard.

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,800
All we would do is say, well from the transform, we've kind of got the

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,000
notion of the Z floor, right.

123
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,900
And we've got the notion of the Z level.

124
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,800
So in theory we could record those for our particles as well and if we

125
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,100
want to do that you know it's not that big of a deal.

126
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,000
So if we want to do something like that, then when we were to would

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,900
On the particles, we would track that information.

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,500
So you know, we do for each protocol for X.

129
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,600
We would say, you know, what is and this would basically just mirror

130
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,500
the render group

131
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,700
Yeah, meow, meow, meow.

132
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,300
Where is my pencil up?

133
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,700
There it is.

134
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,400
So we've got the floors in the chunk see their right.

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
And so if we were to store both of those, we wouldn't need to actually

136
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,800
store them.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,900
A particle per se because we spawn these particles as a batch

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,700
currently.

139
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,600
So, in theory, you know, we've got these four X's here for X is 4.

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,700
X is 4X, has we want this particle structure to be aligned?

141
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,300
Slowly.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,300
So the these two being sort of orphaned isn't a great idea.

143
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,500
So we'd probably sick at at the end of here so that to make sure

144
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,900
everything lines up on a 4X boundary other than that.

145
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,400
We're fine.

146
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,200
So, if you take a look at what's going on here,

147
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,800
you can see that all we would need to do.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,100
Is when someone says spawn fire, we just need the floor.

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,000
Z and the chunks d.

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,200
And so you know it's like I said it's theoretically possible to get

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,800
this information in here so let's just go ahead and try it.

152
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't love it.

153
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
We're but you know I don't want to prematurely say that we're not

154
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,800
going to do it all.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,600
So let's just try it first and we'll see where we land at that point.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,799
So then we could say all right in our object transforms.

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,500
As we go, we can set the chunk Z and the floor Z to a particular

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,300
particles.

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,100
Things, we can set those here, because they'll be the same for each

160
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,200
batch of four particles that will obviously come from the a particle

161
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,600
there.

162
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,300
There we go.

163
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,000
And if we're gonna overwrite that then probably what we would want to

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,900
do is we wouldn't want to we probably want to have our own version

165
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,400
here.

166
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,400
So I'd probably say like okay since we're going to modify it, let's

167
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,200
say that we have a transform that equals our Transformer in it, so

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,200
that we don't break the transform for the people who come after us,

169
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:30,000
which we might do otherwise, that's mostly that

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,900
Let's go take the address there.

171
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,300
So spawn fire is going to have to get that information.

172
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
Hopefully, we have that information.

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,700
That would be over here somewhere when we want to spawn.

174
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
These guys, let's take a look.

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,400
We sort of do sort of don't write, like we only compute these 44 ones.

176
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
We actually know about.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,400
So, while the chunk Z is quite easy to compute, the floor, Z is not so

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
easy to compute.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
It should be much easier to compute because it should just be a

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,900
straight value that you can just look up.

181
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,600
And so we could probably get it pretty easily by just doing a multiply

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,900
based on the chunk.

183
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,400
See which, of course at that point, one might wonder why we don't just

184
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,600
pass one value down in the answer is because we haven't gotten to that

185
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
level of cleanliness yet.

186
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,500
But

187
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,900
Um, when we do stuff on fire point being, where is there it is.

188
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,900
We have one of these pretty easily which is just the Z layer, but we

189
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,300
have to figure out how to get the other one because we haven't

190
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,700
actually we only compute that for the levels.

191
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,200
We can see and we want to spawn fire probably on any level.

192
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,300
Although maybe that night, I think we do though any level regardless

193
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,400
of, whether we can see it.

194
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,300
So anyway, when we do this bonfire, we get the Z layer, we then need

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,300
That that floor is he this guy right here and I'm going to maybe put

196
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,400
these in the opposite order, okay?

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So, that floor is e.

198
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,900
I have to figure out a way to compute and you can kind of see the way

199
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,200
that's been computed up here already.

200
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,600
It's, it's called camera relative Ramsey and it's getting computed

201
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,000
this way, right?

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,600
You can, you can kind of see, it's like, okay, whatever the relative

203
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,500
layer index is, you know, I mean this this is the computation so if we

204
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,800
bake out that computation, we should be able to just do it wherever we

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,300
want to.

206
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,700
So, I'll put it one in there temporarily and then maybe we can

207
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,000
systematically

208
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Sighs out a little bit.

209
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,600
So it's not such a, you know, hacky sort of cut and paste these sort

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,100
of thing.

211
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,300
So in terms of whatever the relative layer index is, I assume that

212
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,700
it's get the relative layer index.

213
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,100
All we would really have to do is take the Untied easy layer.

214
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,600
Right, and subtract it from the cameras e layer.

215
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
And I don't know what the camera is.

216
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,500
You layer is, but I'm assuming we must have had to figure out what

217
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,200
that was before at some point, right?

218
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,900
Somewhere.

219
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,800
Here, we must have that information.

220
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,300
What is the cameras?

221
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,700
Level value.

222
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,500
Anybody know.

223
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,400
Well, I don't know.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
It's probably zero in.

225
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,700
Ah, I know what this is, never mind.

226
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,800
So these are just, these are Computing.

227
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:02,100
The relative ones, which means it's always just assuming that its

228
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,300
relative, 20 being where the camera is.

229
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,500
So presumably, when we do the entity layer Z stuff, when we compute

230
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,200
its relative one, we must have a way of figuring that out, right?

231
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,000
So we must do it right in here.

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,300
So relatively as alert here, it is.

233
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
So it's Tim region, origin chunk.

234
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,600
See, that's what I'm like.

235
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
I knew it's in here somewhere.

236
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,400
There's got to be a way to compute that that layer.

237
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,500
All right, so let's take a look.

238
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,400
At how this stuff is working here?

239
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,300
Doodoo meow, meow.

240
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,400
So if I want to know what it is, I just look it up from the Sim region

241
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,300
and off we go.

242
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:55,100
So now we're spawning these in theory at the correct floor height, you

243
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,500
know, and I would highlight the in theory there because we are not

244
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,700
actually dying to verify that that was true, but now we can sort of

245
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,700
check to see whether that had any effect whatsoever on, you know, go

246
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,500
to the other go.

247
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,400
Haha, there you go.

248
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,600
I don't know why we're now stopping in that space.

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,200
I guess that's just the way the alignment was so weird.

250
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,400
Anyway,

251
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,100
So, here we go.

252
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,000
So it doesn't look like that has any effect on it, right?

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,700
Like it looks like it still, it still gives that really weird like

254
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,000
sinusoidal pattern

255
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,000
As we go.

256
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,800
You know, from left to right?

257
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,200
All of those particles, still shift and they don't shift in a very

258
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,000
predictable way far as I can see.

259
00:14:59,500 --> 00:14:59,800
I do.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,400
No.

261
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,600
So yeah.

262
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,200
It bugs me a little that I don't have a good idea about why that would

263
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,100
be happening.

264
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,100
I am interested to know about whether the Z value of these things.

265
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,000
I mean, my feeling is that since the Z values are not gonna

266
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,400
Since the Z values of the particles are not really related because

267
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,500
it's always doing the perspective based on the chunk.

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't understand why, you know, I don't understand why I'm not

269
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,100
getting a consistent movement and why there's that sort of slippage

270
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,900
back and forth.

271
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,500
And so I wish I had more of an inkling as to why that would be why

272
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,300
there would be that kind of slippage there.

273
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,400
And

274
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,600
One thing I can think of is if it was an off by one frame error, but

275
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
if it was, I would see Jitter.

276
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,700
It wouldn't be a smooth, it wouldn't be smooth like it is, right?

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,600
Because when we change the simulation time step, we're still rendering

278
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,100
at 60 frames a second.

279
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,100
So, in off by one frame error would not manifest itself as a sort of

280
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,300
weird displacement like that, that was really consistent, it would be

281
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,400
like a single framed

282
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Are still always at 60 frames, a second of Jitter.

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,100
So I really don't know.

284
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm at a loss for why?

285
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,000
That would be transforming the way that it is.

286
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,300
So we'll have to start playing around with something and and seeing

287
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,400
how it goes because you can see it really clearly, right?

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,599
And what's interesting about it is, so I guess here's one pretty big

289
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,200
clue.

290
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:18,800
At least.

291
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I think it's a clue.

292
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,300
It looks to me.

293
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:26,599
like, if we watch,

294
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,200
These particles more carefully.

295
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
that they do, they do kind of look like

296
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,200
they are separating.

297
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,000
In parts, right?

298
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Like it does look like different parts of them gets get moved

299
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
differently right?

300
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,700
Which does sort of still suggests that there's some kind of weirdness

301
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,300
to the prospective there or something odd going on.

302
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,800
And again I'm not

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,100
Really sure what that is.

304
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,800
But not all of the particles move the same amount.

305
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,600
So do you see here these particles are moving this way.

306
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,900
And these are saying stationery.

307
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,100
Right.

308
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,500
And see.

309
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,000
Here's the weird part 2.

310
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
Where now they start to move back.

311
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,900
So I guess I don't have any real strong ideas about that other than it

312
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,700
does, it sure does.

313
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,400
Look like, there's some perspective motion going on there of some

314
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
kind, which I'm not sure why there would be.

315
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,100
I'll double-check our perspective transform because I would like to

316
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,100
see what's going on there, but I guess one thing I could try as well

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,900
is let's just zero out the Z component of our particles to see whether

318
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,600
it makes a difference, right?

319
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,900
Because if I was to set the Z component,

320
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,800
Are always.

321
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,200
So for example, here is the p-value if I'm just to eliminate the

322
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
p-value entirely and then run the code.

323
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Again, in theory, I should now have one where there's no Z component

324
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,400
to the particles at.

325
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
All right?

326
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,200
There's there.

327
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,000
Just why, I guess, right?

328
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
And I don't even know.

329
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
Did they even have a z-value in the first place?

330
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not sure.

331
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,800
Because I thought we, we didn't actually you

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,900
Use the so there's e values.

333
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,600
Actually should always be zero anyway, right 000.

334
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,100
So yeah, even though probably they should be using Z, these, this is

335
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,500
copied from a particle system.

336
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,100
Remember, when we were just doing tests, there are only moving in.

337
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,600
Why

338
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Right?

339
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,300
So there is no.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
To even have them transform at all.

341
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,300
You know what I mean?

342
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,100
Woohoo, so I really not sure.

343
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,300
How we can get such a weird slip-and-slide there.

344
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,800
And let's take a look at what we're feeding in for the transform.

345
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,300
Then I wonder if there's something odd about the transform that I

346
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,800
should be aware of here.

347
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,800
so,

348
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,700
Some care.

349
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,400
So, if I were to take a look at that transform, that is in World mode

350
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,100
update, and render particles.

351
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
So that's using the world transform.

352
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
And that seems pretty reasonable.

353
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
I would like to see for the entities.

354
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
What are they using for a transform?

355
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,300
So, if we take a look here, when we build this stuff,

356
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,000
hmm.

357
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
so, interestingly enough

358
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,200
This is not actually what the entities are using for drawing because

359
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,100
this code is kind of a little, too stringy at this point.

360
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,000
In this case, we passed the camera P.

361
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,400
So it's actually,

362
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,300
It's actually subtracting away the camera p as part of for the world

363
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,200
offset and then we're passing that in and you know, we're redoing that

364
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,900
calculation, right?

365
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,800
So the entity transform also has that it sort of separated out there

366
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,000
which should yield the same result.

367
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Like there's nothing particularly unusual about that.

368
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,700
Certainly

369
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,100
I don't know.

370
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,400
I don't know.

371
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,600
So that's a tough one.

372
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,700
That's a pretty tough one, and I guess we're going to have to get a

373
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,000
little bit more serious here.

374
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,300
So the first thing I want to do is I want to take an entity and the

375
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,400
particles it spawned.

376
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,900
And I want to start a start to correlate.

377
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,600
What is actually getting sent down for their transforms because since

378
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,500
I I'm like, literally have no idea, right?

379
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,700
Like I'm looking at this problem and just going okay I from the motion

380
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,300
nothing is jumping out at me as like, oh well it's obviously X, right?

381
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And so I don't have anywhere in particular to investigate.

382
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,800
So what I want to try and do is say well, if I know that two things

383
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,500
are wrong, if I know that like the position and of the end of the,

384
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,600
like, the, the ground chunks and the particles that are on top of

385
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,800
them.

386
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,600
If I know that those two things are moving relative to each other, and

387
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
I don't think they should be.

388
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:58,000
Then what I want to do is try to take a look at what are they sending

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
down to the renderer?

390
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,900
Right?

391
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,300
Because if I look at what they're posting out of the render, I should

392
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,200
be able to find a

393
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,900
Somewhere and hopefully by look you know sort of hunting down that

394
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,300
difference, I would be able to go.

395
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,700
Okay here now I can see what the problem is between these two.

396
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,700
Right.

397
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,700
And so here's the, you know, and here's the code, get render into G

398
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,600
basis P.

399
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,900
That is the thing that's actually doing the transform for the camera.

400
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,800
And when you look at what happens here, right?

401
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,800
You can kind of see the projected, the projection stuff.

402
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,700
It's based off a few things that floors, he's setting the the the Z

403
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,000
value of the Z value of the

404
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
Component itself is not actually used for that.

405
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's just used for the Computing, the Y displacement, right?

406
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,400
The projection is actually coming entirely from just the floor Z.

407
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,900
That's where the distance 2pz competition comes in.

408
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
So I don't really know why we would be getting

409
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Why we would be getting that problem?

410
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,200
So what I'm going to do is I just want to take a look at these two

411
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
things and see what I can see.

412
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,900
So what I'm going to try doing is I'm just going to step in.

413
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm going to kill this.

414
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,300
I'm going to step in to see the first time that I spawn a particle.

415
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,500
What I want to do is I just want to back up quickly and well I guess I

416
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
don't need to back up too quickly here.

417
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,600
But Flora Z is 0, chunk Z is 0, so that's easy to remember.

418
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,300
And all I want to do is I want to look at where this entity that,

419
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,400
that, you know, did this morning, where is the entity getting rendered

420
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
itself?

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,200
Like what does it sanity transform?

422
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,100
Actually look like, by the time we get down to when it actually gets

423
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,200
used, right?

424
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,800
So,

425
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,000
We've got all this stuff here.

426
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,600
We're coming down to it here.

427
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,300
And here we are with our transform, finally, getting put into use

428
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,200
right here.

429
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,400
So here is the entity transform.

430
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Here's getting sent down.

431
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,200
I'm just gonna like select this and cut and paste it.

432
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,500
So I'm going to go into for coder here, going to scratch buffer.

433
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
Here is my data and scratch buffer.

434
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,300
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to set a breakpoint.

435
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,100
So when we actually go to render those particles, I'm going to go

436
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,900
ahead and set a breakpoint.

437
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:46,000
When we go to render the first particle and see what its transform is

438
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
because they should be.

439
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,000
Same right?

440
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,800
What I'd like to see is them having the same transform if that makes

441
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,300
sense.

442
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,700
So let's go ahead and do that.

443
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,700
I lost my place because I accidentally hit the F10 key.

444
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:08,200
All right, so what I want to do is just come over here and take a look

445
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
at that transform.

446
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,300
And now we'll cut and paste it and put it in here.

447
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,100
Oops, it's not wanted.

448
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,700
So let's take a look.

449
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,800
They're both set to Upright.

450
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,800
The offset p is just a different X Y, but otherwise the Z is the same.

451
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,200
The scale is the same manual, sort all of the stuff.

452
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,300
So again, it sure looks like it's ending the same data down to me,

453
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,200
right?

454
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,500
I mean that that's looking basically the same.

455
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,400
Yeah, so I don't really see.

456
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,000
I don't see where the difference comes in there.

457
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,300
Now, one thing that I guess, I don't know is when these things get

458
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,100
rendered.

459
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,800
What if they set up for a clip region?

460
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,000
I guess that, I don't know, because I don't know if the clip region

461
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,900
ever, specifies anything more complicated.

462
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,100
I don't think it does.

463
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,700
At least not for our purposes, and it should be always using the same

464
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,000
one for the entirety of the the game.

465
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
The actual game graphs at the moment.

466
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Who.

467
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,300
So yeah.

468
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,100
That looks the same to me.

469
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
Unless I'm missing something.

470
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,900
Now, I guess, one thing that's slightly, odd is the X and the Y, are

471
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,200
not in the transform in this case.

472
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,300
So, you know,

473
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,200
I don't know how much that would matter.

474
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,900
I don't expect that it would but you know we could imagine temporarily

475
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,300
that it did for some reason.

476
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
And if that was the case, then

477
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We would be able to eliminate the bug in the following way.

478
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And so, I guess I'm going to do that and we'll see instead of having

479
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,300
the p-values come in this way.

480
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,700
What I would do is set these 20

481
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,600
or I guess X.

482
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,500
That's not what I would do.

483
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,500
I would set the transforms, offset P equal to p and then I'd set P 20.

484
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,100
So now all of the information is coming through in the offset itself

485
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
if that makes sense.

486
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,600
And, you know, we can see whether that has any effect.

487
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
I should make sure to that actually, yeah, that's okay.

488
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,100
And so we'll see if that has any bearing on it whatsoever.

489
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,600
I don't know if it will or it won't.

490
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,500
What happened there?

491
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,800
Why did that not do anything?

492
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,900
Why am I not getting any displacement by offset P?

493
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,500
Somebody.

494
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,100
No on.

495
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,500
Tell me.

496
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,700
Because the P value should be the P that we get past plus the offset

497
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,000
piece.

498
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,100
So if I pass in the transforms, offset P there I should, it should

499
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,600
transform by that.

500
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,500
By that offset value, right?

501
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,000
I mean, that should be what?

502
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
What happens there.

503
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,700
So I'm not sure why we wouldn't.

504
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,200
Why we wouldn't see essentially the same results, right?

505
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,000
Not sure why we still have a w in here.

506
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
So that's a little odd.

507
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
Because I'm not crazy right?

508
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,300
It says right here that we're doing the two-piece plus each other.

509
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,800
So let me take a look at the office at P here and yeah.

510
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,300
So if we do the two-piece plus each other in theory, we should still

511
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,300
be getting that displacement.

512
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Oh yeah.

513
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,900
Except of course we have to always remember to still keep that

514
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,800
displacement, right?

515
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,300
S because we've got an incoming displacement for the camera off set.

516
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:46,800
Set.

517
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,700
So obviously we need.

518
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,900
Yeah that's good.

519
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,700
Nice work.

520
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Nice work case it.

521
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,100
Good job.

522
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,900
Great job.

523
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,500
so yeah, the transforming it comes in with the cameras offset and then

524
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,700
we've got our particles

525
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
We want to add those together shove that in the offset P.

526
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,100
That's actually what I should have been doing and now I am so this

527
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,900
should be more correct let's see.

528
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
And we got a course slow it down here.

529
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,900
Let's slow it down and take a look.

530
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Same thing.

531
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,000
So now we like we know we're passing the same information but we're

532
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,400
getting for some reason.

533
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,600
This weird sinusoidal and behavior.

534
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,000
I do not understand why that is happening.

535
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,900
That is a real stumper.

536
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,500
Mmm.

537
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,400
So I guess one other thing to do here would be to not have the

538
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,000
particles, go anywhere and see if that does anything.

539
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,500
That would basically be something of the form, you know?

540
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Don't update the position or the velocity ever.

541
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,000
Under any circumstances, you can update the color if you want to.

542
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,800
And so now when I go through and do these, they'll should just they'll

543
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,100
just stay where they are, right.

544
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,200
Eventually they'll fade out, but they'll just they'll just stay in one

545
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,800
place.

546
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,000
And so when I slide to the side, all I'm going to see is just where

547
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,200
they move because they're not moving of their own accord at all.

548
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,900
And they've only been at their initial locations, right?

549
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,200
So that is just fascinating, right?

550
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,600
Look at how those are moving.

551
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,000
Did you see that?

552
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,600
These are particles that are not moving in any way as far as We Know.

553
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,300
And they sort of crank downward.

554
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,800
I'll put back in the the frame to frame displacement because obviously

555
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,700
it's a little hard to watch when the thing is kind of Jitter like

556
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:41,900
that.

557
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,100
So I'll leave that in there but man is that crazy.

558
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,600
Right.

559
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,300
I mean, tell me that wasn't crazy.

560
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,300
There we go.

561
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,300
Like, look at that.

562
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,400
They like they go in a circle.

563
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,000
So there's basically like a cosine, they are going in like a

564
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,900
360-degree like cosine sine Circle.

565
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,600
Right.

566
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,400
So, the camera off set.

567
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,400
And the camera offset alone is causing them to rotate around

568
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
something.

569
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,700
I don't know what.

570
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,900
And that is just just absolutely fascinating.

571
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
so, I guess

572
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,800
Working backwards from that.

573
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
I would say that, you know,

574
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:28,200
we must be looking at something that has to do with the moment arm

575
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,300
like the rotational construction of these guys, you know what else I

576
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,000
should do?

577
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,600
I would like to verify that I think about it that this happens on both

578
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
render paths.

579
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,200
So what's what happens if I go over here?

580
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
And I set the frame rate all the way.

581
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,700
I'm at the frame rate, the update rate very, very low.

582
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,700
And then I switch to software rendering.

583
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,600
So now we're software rendering.

584
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,100
And now I like slide my dude slowly to the side.

585
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,200
And of course I would probably should have built-in release.

586
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,000
In fact, you know what, I will build in release mode.

587
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,000
You don't want R to take forever.

588
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:15,700
Okay.

589
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,900
So let's build an oops, hold release mode and will spill batti, man.

590
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,300
but,

591
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,600
What just happened there?

592
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,900
I missed that.

593
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,700
Do we have a release mode bug here?

594
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,400
Oh, are we unaligned?

595
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,100
What's going on there?

596
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
Give me something to work with your friend.

597
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,300
What was my crash type?

598
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,700
Access violation reading.

599
00:38:59,700 --> 00:38:59,800
No.

600
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,300
All.

601
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,400
Okay.

602
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Who is telling you to read?

603
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,800
No, obviously it's a dash.

604
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
So that means system particles, plus particle.

605
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,700
Index is somehow equal to null, is system known.

606
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,200
Can I inspect system at all?

607
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,000
My particles is definitely not null.

608
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,600
So what what are you talking about there?

609
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,500
Big guy.

610
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,500
Show me the disassembly.

611
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:01,900
So what are we looking at here are 15 so that must be an actually, I'm

612
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,500
as guessing this is just an unaligned move or something because

613
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,300
there's no way that that's actually a zero access because if this is

614
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,400
the address that it's trying to read, right?

615
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,600
Well, that memory address is clearly not zero.

616
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,300
Right.

617
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,100
So assuming we're trying to go from there, what is that, that memory

618
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
address, by the way?

619
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,000
Let's see here.

620
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,400
R15 - oh bah.

621
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,800
Oh well.

622
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,400
Okay, so it actually is zero though.

623
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
This is quite peculiar.

624
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,600
So what are you trying to do here mister?

625
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,900
Mister compiler.

626
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,800
So your rerouting.

627
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,000
Okay.

628
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,300
So you take frame displacement and you replicated it out.

629
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,100
I assume

630
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,200
yeah, and

631
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,800
Unsurprisingly AR-15 is the register that's holding the pointer to

632
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,500
system.

633
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,900
Oh not quite.

634
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,900
It's holding the pointer to what exactly maybe stack frame of some

635
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,300
kind?

636
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm not sure.

637
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,500
So let's take a look.

638
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,200
Here are 15 is 10.

639
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,800
See what are my main variables?

640
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,100
Here, entropy DT.

641
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,800
Okay, so that's a register.

642
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,700
Finished basement in its surrender group.

643
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,800
Cb8.

644
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,000
All right, so we're look at the memory here.

645
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,100
I'm not just a giant wash of nothing.

646
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,200
So it looks to me like if it's trying to load out of there, I feel

647
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,700
like it's probably trying to load.

648
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,300
That that would be the system particles array.

649
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
You would think.

650
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,700
it's just

651
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,700
Gene 18, let's find out.

652
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,900
So let's take that and subtract it from this and see where it can't

653
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,100
quit load that can I

654
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,000
Come on.

655
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,300
I want I want to be able to get that part there.

656
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,700
It is, can I ask?

657
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,600
No, I can't.

658
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,700
I want to get that value, please.

659
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,600
Oh, Visual Studio.

660
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,400
You make debugging such a joy.

661
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,700
I just wanted to see where we were in here.

662
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,400
I want to see where we were.

663
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,800
So they're both 1017.

664
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,500
This one's 18 this with C8.

665
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,900
So I guess I'll just do it in my head.

666
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
It does it's not particularly hard, right?

667
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,500
It's just C8 -18 Actually, I don't even need to do in my head, I can

668
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,900
see how to keep up the expression going to do it for me.

669
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,600
So we're that far in.

670
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,800
And that far in seems like something you should be able to load.

671
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,500
So I'm guessing I don't know what we've got here.

672
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,400
I don't know why it can't load that.

673
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,700
It doesn't really make any sense to me.

674
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm not sure what I'm looking at here and I don't understand why this

675
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,900
would be an unaligned load because if you were loading at oh well, but

676
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,700
yes, I do.

677
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,900
So I think this is just unaligned load, I think that's what the

678
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,700
problem is.

679
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,200
So what I've got to do, yeah, that's all it is.

680
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,400
All right, so I don't know if you guys follow that Ridiculousness but

681
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,100
basically I'll just go over it again.

682
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm pretty sure it's what I said it was originally, but I just wanted

683
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,700
to make sure and I'm not the best at assembly.

684
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,500
So you know, takes me a little while to like make sure I only read it.

685
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,800
In these exact circumstances.

686
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,100
What I'm like, I got to figure out what's actually happening.

687
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,200
So you can see that it gave me an Access violation reading location,

688
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,000
zero error here.

689
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,700
And so that would imply that I was like accessing memory that I wasn't

690
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,000
supposed to access, right?

691
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,800
Like I was reading off of a null pointer or something, but inspecting

692
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,400
the assembly.

693
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,100
It was pretty clear that that was not really what was going on as far

694
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:24,900
as I could tell.

695
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,000
And so what I actually thought was happening is that because this is

696
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Um, Cindy code here that probably what was going on is that it was a

697
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,100
non-aligned load and what happens is if you have a 70 instruction that

698
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,300
expects to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary and it's not aligned to a

699
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,100
16 byte boundary and we've talked about all this stuff on here before.

700
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,700
So if you don't know, I'm talking about, I would encourage you to go

701
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,000
back, go back and start earlier because that is all covered.

702
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,300
We need our Sim delos to be aligned.

703
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:02,500
And what happens is, you can see that we've got our particles for our

704
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:07,300
particle system are aligned here, potentially, but when we allocate

705
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,600
this particle cash, it's not necessarily going to be aligned unless we

706
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,800
force it to be aligned.

707
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,400
And what you'll notice is we get the particle cash from in handmade,

708
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,200
World group, weird mode, rather.

709
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,700
I would, you can see, here, is, I tell it to do.

710
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,700
No clear, but I don't give it an alignment, which means that it's not

711
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,900
necessarily going to be aligned to sixteen, byte boundary our default

712
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,300
alignment in handmade hero.

713
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,200
When we allocate things, we only try to pass them out to a 4 byte

714
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,500
boundary in our, in our, in our allocator, right?

715
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
And our memory Arena.

716
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,300
And I think what's that in here?

717
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:45,700
Yeah.

718
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,300
So if you take a look at what's going to happen, they're aligned no.

719
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,500
Clear is probably more what we want.

720
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,700
So we can say, hey

721
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,100
We need to align this to a 16 byte boundary because there's stuff in

722
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,600
here that needs to be loaded at alignment so you can't go fussing with

723
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:01,800
it.

724
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,400
I think that would probably fix it and I'm right.

725
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,000
All right.

726
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,500
So, let's go over here.

727
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,400
Let's let the simulation down again.

728
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,300
Will switch to the software renderer.

729
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,000
And again, I just wanted to make sure that this was the same in both

730
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,700
renderers because then that also tells me that it's not something

731
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,100
about like how we're interfacing to say open trailer, something like

732
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,300
this.

733
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,200
So here is our software renderer, we've switched to.

734
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,000
So now not using the graphics card at all and let's see what happens

735
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,800
when I move.

736
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,400
Okay.

737
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,500
So you can see them, they're still undergoing that Corkscrew motion.

738
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,500
So this is good because this basically tells us exactly what we need

739
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,600
to know, it has nothing to do with the render layer and Below.

740
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,100
It's at

741
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,500
The sort of upper level of the renderer when we're actually specifying

742
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,300
these particles.

743
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,200
Things are going bonkers, right?

744
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Okay, so if I now go into handmade render group, what I want to do

745
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,900
here is I would like to sort of get some reacquaintance because we

746
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,800
don't have looked at this in a while at what happens when we actually

747
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,900
send down one of these bitmaps, right?

748
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,900
When I do a push bitmap call, I just want to see what I what I get

749
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,400
here, so you can see that.

750
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,900
I'm I've got an x-axis and a y-axis, the x-axis, the y-axis get sent

751
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,400
down here as part of the push-fit map.

752
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,000
All.

753
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,700
So presumably, they're just getting set to like one and zero and

754
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,200
they're getting multiplied by the scale values that come out here.

755
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,100
Which is the whatever size we've given the thing plus, plus the scale

756
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,400
value, right?

757
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,300
So

758
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,900
Since we don't see the bitmap rotating it all.

759
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,200
I figure that can't really be part of it.

760
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
I mean if the X and Y axes were moving it all there we would see that

761
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,000
and I can't really see like you know when we are passing

762
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:27,600
I guess.

763
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,500
Let's see what get bitmap Tim does.

764
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:50,800
So, in this case, we are passing through this dimpy so, yeah, you can

765
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,000
see.

766
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
There's a little bit of funny business going on here, right?

767
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,700
We use the alignment Point, like the hotspot, basically, of whatever

768
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,500
the thing is that we're passing down.

769
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,900
And that's actually the thing that gets transformed, right?

770
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,000
So, the alignment itself.

771
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,500
Sort of says, where the point is that the bitmap would be

772
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,100
Round.

773
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,100
I don't know immediately, why that would be anything to be concerned

774
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,400
about at the moment but it's just something to keep in mind there.

775
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:28,100
And you can kind of see, we pass this, the C line value down, that's

776
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:28,900
what controls these.

777
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,300
So, you know, if it was the alignment that was doing it.

778
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,200
Well, that kind of gives us though, one way to take that out of the

779
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,000
equation as well, which might be good, which is to say when we go

780
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,600
ahead and render one of these bitmaps if we call Push, but map,

781
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,600
Strip map.

782
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,400
I and we pass like the offset in the color, I could then pass 00 for

783
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,500
the alignment.

784
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,900
And hopefully, that would give me.

785
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,000
Oops, what did I do?

786
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,000
Accidentally edited that I did not mean to I should be able to take

787
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,100
that out and I should be able to see if the alignment has anything to

788
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,900
do with it either.

789
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,900
I'm assuming it doesn't, but again, obviously my assumptions, don't

790
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:23,400
mean anything.

791
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,000
Because any time you're fry in a situation like this, which, you know,

792
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,500
doesn't happen very often where you're finding looking for a bug, you

793
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,500
have no idea what it is, your assumptions are obviously wrong or you

794
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,500
would know where the bug was right.

795
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,900
So that to me, looks like that really doesn't change matters at all.

796
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,700
So I don't think that's it.

797
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
So I don't think that's implicated.

798
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:07,200
So I'm not sure what that leaves us with changing the camera offset.

799
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,100
Causes a corkscrew motion.

800
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,200
I mean, if we had rotation matrices or anything like that in cure, I

801
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:29,900
could see it being related but I really just don't know where that

802
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,500
would be.

803
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,900
So I'm going to look to see where we do any trig at all.

804
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,800
So this is all code, that's not even used, right?

805
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,200
This was when we were playing around with some lighting stuff and

806
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,400
weird things like that are M2 is there

807
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,900
But that's about it, that's not used.

808
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:04,800
So if I do look for arm to arm to is used pretty much only in angle

809
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:10,000
offset movement mode, which these are particles.

810
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,500
They're not going through that.

811
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,400
So I don't even know where we could generate motion of that form

812
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,700
because if we're not in putting any kind of circular operation, I'm

813
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,300
not sure.

814
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,000
Are we even get?

815
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,200
Anything like that to happen.

816
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,000
This is a Brain Buster.

817
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,000
This may be the weirdest bug.

818
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,100
I think we've ever seen on handmade hero.

819
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,300
I have absolutely no idea because if you asked me generate a circular

820
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,300
motion without using sine and cosine

821
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,400
I think I'd be at a loss.

822
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:09,100
I mean, I suppose I could try to I mean I don't know like pretty much

823
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,600
everything.

824
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,800
I know how to do that.

825
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
Involves rotation is going to have to take a sine, the cosine at some

826
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,000
point.

827
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,900
So I guess, I mean the answer is that must not be really a circular

828
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,600
motion, it's got to be some other motion that just kind of looks

829
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,000
vaguely.

830
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,700
Circular

831
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Which I guess is fine.

832
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,200
But yeah, that's that's pretty confusing.

833
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,700
So it's definitely not circular guess.

834
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
That's what I'd say.

835
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,800
I guess I will open it up.

836
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,300
To the Q and A for now.

837
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,500
Because well I'm just thinking of random things to do.

838
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,200
If anyone wants to ask a question,

839
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,600
Neal says, look at the screen border, while you're doing it yet is the

840
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,500
screen border, do a similar thing.

841
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,200
Oh yeah, you're totally right.

842
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:57,700
So basically everything transformed by that world transform has this

843
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,000
happen to it but for some reason, the entities don't

844
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,200
Hmm.

845
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,700
And he's got this place by the modified camera P during room

846
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:21,500
transitions.

847
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,100
I think.

848
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,100
Yeah.

849
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,400
But aren't we also do not.

850
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,700
I guess we must not be doing that correctly.

851
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,300
And yeah, so if it's just that, then that would make sense because it

852
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,900
is a little like Parabola thing.

853
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Which is sort of wrote, looks a little rotation e, someone suggested

854
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,900
and I think this is a very good suggestion.

855
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:46,800
Who suggested it?

856
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,800
This Isaac said, what if you try no, not sorry.

857
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,200
Cyberpunk hobo said, what if you disable the parabolic camera?

858
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:03,700
Transition terms, I think that is a good idea because assuming that

859
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,900
that is what's, if that is what sort of instigating it then we can at

860
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,400
least guarantee that that it is that Z motion.

861
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,500
That's it's a getting it by turning it off.

862
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,500
Because if we turn it off and it stops happening, then we know that's

863
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,000
the case if it's still happening.

864
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,400
Then we know that it's not that which is a good clue, right?

865
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,200
Doesn't quite tell us what's wrong, but it is a good clue.

866
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,900
So, here we have the world mode camera offset thing with the room,

867
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,900
Delta stuff.

868
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,900
I think, what we could probably do is just say like, okay, you know,

869
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:44,700
World mode camera offset, does equal, 0 0, and then, from there, we

870
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,600
know that we've zeroed out that particular piece of information.

871
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:53,800
So now when I go across the rooms, it should just be a straight, you

872
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
know, straight pan.

873
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,000
So hopefully now we will see

874
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,700
That behavior stop.

875
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:03,700
So we can know at least that it is based on the Z movement of the

876
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,500
camera.

877
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,600
Yeah, and that looks nice and solid, okay?

878
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,500
So at least we know it's based on the Z movement of the camera.

879
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,400
And so the question is, just if the Z Move Motion of the camera is

880
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,600
what's causing that to occur?

881
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,700
Why is it that we're a seemingly not applying that camera rotation.

882
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,400
The same for the entities as we are for everything else and I don't

883
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,200
know why, I guess it's just a slip of the finger.

884
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,100
There's but yeah, you can kind of see that happening there.

885
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:52,900
So when we look at the entities, we pass the camera P down into the

886
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,000
entities, right?

887
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,400
and,

888
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,600
I don't think we really do much else with it.

889
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:12,000
So I mean, get into the ground point - camera P.

890
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,600
Should be the same as sticking that into the transform.

891
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,200
Are we putting it in backwards or something?

892
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Let's find out.

893
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:42,800
so,

894
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,400
Yeah, I mean this looks like the same transform.

895
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:49,600
Right?

896
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,900
It's just subtracting camera P.

897
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,500
That's all it does.

898
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,200
So, it should be the same as it is in here, unless there's anything

899
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,700
happened to Canberra P along the way.

900
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,600
Doesn't look like it does anything happen to World transform?

901
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,400
No.

902
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,000
So, I mean it it seems like it's the same.

903
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,800
Exact operation.

904
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:33,800
Right.

905
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,500
I mean, that is.

906
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,700
That is exactly it.

907
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,900
If the camera offset Z.

908
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,300
I mean, so I guess similarly

909
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,500
Right.

910
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,700
If I were to take camera P here and set the z20, I would also expect

911
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,100
none of that behavior to occur, right?

912
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,000
What?

913
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:54,400
So, what's interesting about that is the camera pee.

914
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,100
even if I zero out the Z motion,

915
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,200
So is it actually why motion?

916
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,700
That's really related here.

917
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,900
This is quite creepy.

918
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,500
So camera.

919
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,700
Mode, world made camera offset is that used elsewhere.

920
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,600
There's the places where we set it.

921
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,700
Cutscene doesn't matter.

922
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,400
I see.

923
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,100
I see said the blind, man.

924
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,900
We are using that.

925
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
in here, to set the floor height,

926
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,000
And we shouldn't be.

927
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,200
Presumably, we should be using this.

928
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,300
Oh boy.

929
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,300
Well yeah, I guess we kind of deserve that with how much tinkering

930
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:55,300
we've been doing with like sort of weird 2D rendering of 3D stuff in a

931
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,800
kind of ad hoc way that's, you know,

932
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,600
It's to be expected, I suppose.

933
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,500
So yeah, that's kind of really nasty.

934
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,200
I mean basically what that implies to me

935
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,400
Yeah, is again, we really have to be more rigorous about these sorts

936
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,800
of things, which, of course, is very difficult because we don't really

937
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,600
know what the right answer is for a lot of them.

938
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,800
But yeah.

939
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,700
So first thing is first, you should use camera P for the entities

940
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,800
because that's what we actually get we're passing in there.

941
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:37,700
Right?

942
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,500
So, we want to do that first.

943
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,800
And now what we have to do is for the particles, we would have to do

944
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,000
the same operation.

945
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,500
So basically, when

946
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,500
Compute the floor height.

947
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:55,100
We've got to take that world mode, camera offset into account.

948
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,500
So yeah.

949
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,700
So you know if we want to do the particles the same way, then what

950
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:08,100
we'd have to do is say, okay we're not going to we're going to pass in

951
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,400
the camera P here.

952
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,800
Instead of the transform, the camera P comes in this way when we

953
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,200
create our transform, we actually create a default transform.

954
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:25,700
and,

955
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,600
We taken here the camera pee.

956
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,700
Then what happens is when we come through this piece of code here,

957
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,700
then what we need to do is, when we are Computing, the, the floor

958
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,500
height there, right?

959
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,800
We need to say like, okay, so, first of all, the, you know, the

960
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,900
transform,

961
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,800
Offset p.

962
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,500
Equals negative camera p.

963
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,200
And then also like the floor.

964
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,900
Z has to have this entity baked into it.

965
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:15,800
There's that.

966
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,399
Here it is.

967
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,399
Right, which is kind of absurd and definitely not going to last.

968
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:33,300
We're going to have to fix that but I believe that is more like what

969
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,700
we would need to do to make sure these things.

970
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,100
Render the saying because hey they've got actually ready to the same.

971
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,600
Hold on a second.

972
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,399
Slow down.

973
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:50,200
Get back over here.

974
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,500
Okay.

975
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,100
Two.

976
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,700
Hey, look.

977
01:08:59,200 --> 01:08:59,800
Sort of work.

978
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,200
Still got some movement there though.

979
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,800
I think probably because those guys are actually at different Z's,

980
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,800
that looks like actual motion.

981
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,300
I would expect at higher Z values

982
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:22,600
Potentially, so that may be a little more understandable, but we'll

983
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,100
see.

984
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,800
We're definitely not getting any more of the parabola displacement

985
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:32,000
though which is what I would expect to see now so that's good.

986
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:40,700
All right.

987
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,300
So a little closer and what was the other thing that I?

988
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,399
What was the thing that I had turned off there?

989
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,300
I think I did I think I turned it back on, right?

990
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,000
And Sim.

991
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:52,800
Region.

992
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,800
I don't have that turned off anymore.

993
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,500
Yeah, I don't.

994
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,100
And what about world mode?

995
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,600
I don't zero anything out anymore.

996
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,100
Do I?

997
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:11,500
All right, so a little bit better, not fantastic still, but a little

998
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,200
bit better.

999
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,800
and yet, I believe that that

1000
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:47,400
I basically think that for 2D you know, you there's a lot of things

1001
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:54,300
that are a lot simpler in 2D right but there's a few that are vastly

1002
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:58,100
more complex you know and

1003
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,900
A lot of it is this way it's basically like because you don't have a

1004
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,700
uniform idea of where everything is.

1005
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:10,100
You end up with all of these kind of hacks and you know we'll get them

1006
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,100
more under control.

1007
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,300
As we go further down handmade here we can crank this down a little

1008
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,100
tighter and get these hacks to be more straightforward.

1009
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:26,200
So you know, it's not as bad as it seems right now because we're still

1010
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,800
in the process of hammering out some of these fire details and we're

1011
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,100
trying to do you know more stuff than we should, you know, I mean

1012
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,900
we're we don't have to do a lot of these things that we're doing.

1013
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,300
We can just ignore these problems and not have some of these features,

1014
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,900
right?

1015
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:49,000
But but yet, when you do 3D, the nice part about that is, you know,

1016
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,500
ahead of time because you're sort of already have a systemic.

1017
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:56,000
Mised way of representing everything, you don't have to come up with

1018
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,900
that stuff yourself.

1019
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,700
So you don't have to go through the hacky phase of, like,

1020
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,900
Doing things out because just like oh if I just actually do the 3D

1021
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,900
math, everything gets placed properly and we're all good, right?

1022
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,800
But, you know, you will quickly get into all those hacks in 3D as

1023
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,200
well.

1024
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,400
Because as soon as you know, yes it takes care of all your

1025
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,500
spatialization for you.

1026
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:24,600
But then transparency, doesn't work properly anymore and you can't do

1027
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
lighting at all.

1028
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:29,300
So, all your lighting stuff Nash to be crazy, hacked, weird stuff.

1029
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,700
And now you've got a whole asset pipeline thing of.

1030
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:36,200
How do you get like mesh data in and texturing and all these sorts of

1031
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,300
things?

1032
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:36,700
So there's

1033
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:39,200
Tons of work apoplexy that does come in.

1034
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,300
So I wouldn't necessarily say that 3D games.

1035
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,900
Are ever going to be less complicated, but there are definitely parts

1036
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:52,600
of the pipeline that just get a lot simpler in 3D, not because there's

1037
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,400
something magically simpler about it.

1038
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,900
But rather, because we've worked it out.

1039
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,200
So, well at this point that you just don't have to do the work, right?

1040
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,600
It's like, if I want to set up a 3D scene, I just know how to do it

1041
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,700
now because we've had so much experience doing that and we've got it

1042
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,200
down to a science, right?

1043
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,100
Whereas 2D games is not quite that way.

1044
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,300
There is no science of 2D games because since it's an approximation,

1045
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,700
there isn't one uniform way that's just re can just teach.

1046
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,500
That's like, oh, yeah.

1047
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:24,400
And no matter what the 2-D game is, here's how you would architect the

1048
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,600
spatialization of it.

1049
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,100
You can't do that because it's always sort of a hack and which hack

1050
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,200
you need to pick is going to be specific to the game.

1051
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,400
And so that's really the problem with the to dienes of it is, is that,

1052
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,600
but again, we'll be able to systematize this stuff as we push a little

1053
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,600
bit harder on it.

1054
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,100
We'll get it down to something.

1055
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:44,700
Cleaner.

1056
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:46,700
It won't be as ugly as it is now.

1057
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,700
So the only reason the 3D kind of appears cleaner in that sense is

1058
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,200
because we've already determined a set of stuff that works and you

1059
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,500
don't have to guess what?

1060
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,400
It's going to be.

1061
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:02,200
So it's kind of clean from the start in that fundamental way.

1062
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,300
What is the difference between handmade hero and 1935?

1063
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:40,300
There.

1064
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,900
Different in pretty much every way you could imagine.

1065
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,100
I don't know if they're completely different, I guess, I would say

1066
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,400
So just now the fix only applied to the particles because the borders

1067
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,000
are still moving.

1068
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,900
Yes, that's correct.

1069
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,300
The borders are using that transform and that transform doesn't do the

1070
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,100
floor thing.

1071
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,200
It's basically, because of that floor hack, we did where we want to

1072
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,800
transform floors at different heights,

1073
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Neil in the code.

1074
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,500
I think they mean, oh,

1075
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,300
Well I guess I would say the handmade hero code sort of has to I guess

1076
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,500
I would say to Maine.

1077
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,100
Well, let's say three main deficiencies compared to say, the 1935

1078
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:34,700
codebase.

1079
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,200
So, number one is, I have to program handmade hero in a way.

1080
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,500
That's one hour a night, and it makes it very difficult for me to keep

1081
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:47,200
the code as clean as I would like it to be from my perspective.

1082
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,000
Because one of the things that often will happen is I'll go through

1083
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,800
these periods of reorganization and a lot of stuff that I can't do

1084
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,300
very effectively in an hour because I kind of have to keep everything

1085
01:15:59,300 --> 01:15:59,400
in

1086
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,100
Brain and and play around with how it's Lots out and stuff like that.

1087
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,500
So things in 1935,

1088
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:12,000
Tend to achieve much higher levels of quality because of the time I

1089
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,900
can devote to it and the blocks of time, right?

1090
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,500
So it's both the duration of coding at a time but also just handmade

1091
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,300
Heroes never going to be a game.

1092
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:26,200
I mean, the number of hours spent on the 1935 codebase is so far

1093
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,500
above, however, how many will ever be able to spend on handmade here?

1094
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,200
All right.

1095
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,300
There's really nothing you can do about that.

1096
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,400
So, you know, it's necessarily less.

1097
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,500
Refined, because there is no way to achieve that level of refinement

1098
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,800
with the constraints of handmade hero.

1099
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,700
So that's just how that is right.

1100
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:58,400
Number two, is that I can't be too advanced on handmade hero, right?

1101
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:05,900
Like I have to keep things in a relatively comfortable Zone both in

1102
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,300
terms of people's ability to

1103
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:13,900
Understand what I'm doing and why I'm doing it on stream and also my

1104
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,100
ability to code it while talking, right?

1105
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,900
And so the very most sophisticated stuff is just not going to be

1106
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:27,000
happening on handmade hero because it's not like possible to do that

1107
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:34,300
and then third is there's no tooling or or environment stuff on

1108
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,100
handmade Heroes.

1109
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,400
So I don't for example, have a meta programming.

1110
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,000
Lair.

1111
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:44,000
I don't have like a virtualized platform layer and stuff like this.

1112
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:49,200
So certain things I have on 935 that I've written that we're sort of

1113
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,100
separate projects that reinforce and are used to develop the main

1114
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:55,900
project.

1115
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,200
Those do not exist on handmade Heroes.

1116
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,800
So the code cannot

1117
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,500
Advantage of any of that.

1118
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,000
Whereas, a 1935, it can.

1119
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:08,200
So I say that there's probably like, you know,

1120
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:14,300
those those three main differences in terms of the code, make it so

1121
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,500
that there's, there's quite a bit of difference between the two code

1122
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,100
bases.

1123
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,100
My approach to the programming though is pretty much always the same.

1124
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,700
Like, I approached the codon handmade here.

1125
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:27,800
The same way I approach a 9:35, the only difference is I'm able to do

1126
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,300
a better job on 1935, then I am on handmade hero.

1127
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,100
So the quality of the code differ is fairly drastically, perhaps but

1128
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,300
the approach doesn't.

1129
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,900
And so you just have to imagine kind of okay, you've see how much

1130
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:40,500
G.

1131
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:47,800
Imagine if I had, you know, ten 10x the hours.

1132
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,900
Where would this code have been in this time period?

1133
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:53,300
Right.

1134
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:58,000
You know, going over the same code and you know hopefully you can

1135
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,900
imagine that it would be much much better because there would just be

1136
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:04,500
all of this additional engineering that could go into it and it, you

1137
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,000
know, it would get proportionally better.

1138
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,300
Are we able to change the projection in this game?

1139
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,200
Yes.

1140
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,000
To a certain extent.

1141
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,500
I mean it's a 2d game that the art assets are 2D so you can only

1142
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,200
change like the way they're scaled really.

1143
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:33,000
You can't rotate them in the third dimension because there isn't any

1144
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,600
like data there to see.

1145
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,500
In a painter.

1146
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,700
Entities is the movement mode angle attack, slipcase missing a break

1147
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,400
or is the fall through intentional falters intentional, if I remember

1148
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:45,000
correctly,

1149
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,800
How far would you say, you are developing this game?

1150
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,500
How many episodes can we still expect?

1151
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,700
I was ballparking 600 so we're like halfway there, but I mean, I don't

1152
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:57,800
know.

1153
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,500
That was just a very random ballpark.

1154
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:07,100
I'd say it's not too out of the question because, you know, we're sort

1155
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,600
of getting the point where the engines pretty good.

1156
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,800
There's still some pretty rough parts to it.

1157
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,400
So we're cut.

1158
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,600
We're kind of trying to work those out now but you know, I would say

1159
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,100
maybe you

1160
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:18,900
Silver off.

1161
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,700
700 800 episodes.

1162
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:26,100
If we're off by a bit, but I don't know.

1163
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,900
It depends on how much gameplay we put in.

1164
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:31,200
Certainly, it's a little bit scalable because we don't have, you know,

1165
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,000
I had goals of wine to cover like all the basic game engine stuff

1166
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,200
showing some of that in all the cases.

1167
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:41,100
And so you know, I that I want to have in there but it terms of what

1168
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:44,900
we put in for gameplay, I don't care as much because you know,

1169
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:48,100
gameplay is more of a game design thing.

1170
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:50,600
And it doesn't.

1171
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,500
You know, it that that's not what this stream was about.

1172
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,600
So I don't really care what we do as long as the

1173
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,900
I've shown enough gameplay programming so that everyone understands

1174
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,800
what, how it, how that sort of code works and how to architect it, or

1175
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,500
how to like play around with architectures for it?

1176
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,700
That's really the only part that I care about there.

1177
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,600
Do you find it difficult to connect?

1178
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,100
Such a few 935 and handmade hero.

1179
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:21,000
And if so has it gotten easier with time?

1180
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:29,800
so, I would say like,

1181
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:40,300
I do, I do find that I wish I could control more when I switch in when

1182
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,500
I don't, there's sometimes on 1935 that I would have liked to just

1183
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,800
been thinking about it for several days at a time, and not have had to

1184
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,200
code, do a, handmade hero.

1185
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,300
So there will probably be a time at some point.

1186
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:58,600
I don't know when where I'll probably take handmade hero off the air

1187
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,300
for three or four months when we are

1188
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,700
Finally 1935, because I, you know, handmade hero as nice as it is,

1189
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,100
doesn't pay the bills, right?

1190
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:14,800
So I have to make sure 1935 ships, and ships.

1191
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,900
Well, so, at some point, I'll probably have to put him a hero on delay

1192
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:23,200
for little bit and then when I come back from that, you know, will

1193
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:27,000
finish handmade hero up, I made even do an accelerated schedule at

1194
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,100
that point, because I'm a like, then switch to handmade hero full-time

1195
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:31,700
for a while maybe do like a couple episodes.

1196
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,300
It was a day or something like that.

1197
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,000
To finish it up.

1198
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,600
I don't know.

1199
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,400
But basically like it definitely is the case that being able to

1200
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:46,400
concentrate on a single code base for a while is better and certainly

1201
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,900
in the future, I wouldn't do another handmade hero.

1202
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,200
Probably.

1203
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,300
I really want to do it and so I'm glad I did, but it definitely is

1204
01:22:54,300 --> 01:23:01,600
taxing in terms of the mental shift and it's not like, it's not

1205
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:04,900
Not possible to program to Cabeza once, but you do take a little bit

1206
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:09,200
of a hit and I don't really want to always take a little bit of a hit,

1207
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:09,600
you know?

1208
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,600
I would rather

1209
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:19,000
You know, I would rather concentrate on one or the other and

1210
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,200
furthermore, you know, if I did do it where I like switch to the

1211
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,900
program, handmade hero more full-time me for a little while.

1212
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,700
That would also allow me to maybe make a little bit better codon

1213
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:34,600
stream because I could do back to back a few episodes, doing something

1214
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,000
that would take longer than an hour.

1215
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,500
And they would kind of my mental state would be the same throughout

1216
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:39,700
them.

1217
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:42,600
So I could kind of, like, make sure that I kept everything in my brain

1218
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:42,900
properly.

1219
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,500
Early and didn't forget anything.

1220
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:59,800
All right, I have a lot of work to do so I am going to go back.

1221
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,100
An end, the stream.

1222
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:04,900
All right.

1223
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,200
Thank you, everyone for joining me for this episode of handmade here.

1224
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,400
It's a pleasure coding with you.

1225
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,900
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

1226
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,300
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org.

1227
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,600
We have a handy and appeared above that.

1228
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,800
We also form site.

1229
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,200
You can go too fast, questions.

1230
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,300
A patreon page, can go to sports video series, a schedule bot.

1231
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,800
You can use to know when we're going to be live and an episode guide,

1232
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,700
if you would like to catch up on old,

1233
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,900
Stuff that's about it for today.

1234
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,800
I'll be back here tomorrow.

1235
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,400
Same time.

1236
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,300
Same place last year of the week, is a Friday.

1237
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,900
It is for the last few of the week.

1238
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,200
And until then have fun program, everyone, and I'll see you on the

1239
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:46,500
internet.

1240
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,500
Take it easy, everybody.
