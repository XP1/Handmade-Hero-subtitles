1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,800
It's upgrading start recruiting.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,900
Hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,400
So as you know, I've been off for two weeks because of hand problems

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,100
and so I kind of wanted to get the stream started again but I don't

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,800
super feel comfortable programming just yet.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,700
We'll talk about why in a minute but so I don't actually know what's

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,100
wrong with my hands yet and sort of kind of working on that.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,400
It's only my left hand.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,600
Actually, that was a problem.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,800
And it's only like right here and in here, so it's kind of like it's

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,500
definitely a median nerve problem of some kind.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
But that's that's very localized.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,800
You know, it's very specific to their in there and I've never actually

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,400
had that problem before which made me pretty nervous because, you

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,000
know, I've been typing for a long time and I've never actually had

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,100
much problems with my hands, ever since I started working the wrist

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,500
braces, I haven't really had much.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,300
In the way of problems, it's just not something I had to really think

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,900
about.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,200
And so now, I don't really know specifically at the moment, what's

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,300
actually wrong with them, or what I need to do about it.

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,000
So I'm kind of, you know, I went to physical therapist, the doctors as

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,300
usual.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,000
No nothing, pretty much.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,200
If you ask a doctor about a biomechanical thing, usually, you get a

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,900
complete nonsense issue.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,500
But yeah, they obviously have no idea as you might expect, but I went

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,500
to a physical therapist and she looked at it.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,900
Pretty you know pretty in depth.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,400
And you know at the very least, we know a couple things like my my arm

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,300
in General, on the left side is not particularly fabulous, my

32
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,500
shoulders, pretty weak compared to my right side and she wanted to

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,300
kind of fix about.

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,000
She wanted to give me a bunch of strength strengthening exercises for

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,700
my arm in general because she felt like before that stuff was fixed.

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,200
There wasn't probably much to do with the hand.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
That was her thinking anyway.

38
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
And what she said, she's actually very smart.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,400
She runs her own place there and she's the only person who's ever

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,600
actually solved a biomechanical problem for me.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,300
So I tend to listen to what she has to say because she's the only

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,000
person who's ever right as far as I can tell.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,500
She was actually saying that she felt probably that because this

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
shoulder is very weak and is not really doing very much.

45
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,600
What ends up happening is that like all of this muscular

46
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,000
Sure is actually Contracting a lot more now than it should be.

47
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,100
Because as it does, its work as things down here, try to actually do

48
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,500
stuff the this this part just gets pulled the musculature here gets

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
pulled and so these things have to contract quite a bit more than they

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,900
ever really actually should, right?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,300
So she wanted to fix that first and I think that's a pretty good idea.

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
So, I've been doing exercises for that and we'll

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
It does seem like it's a little bit better now, but I think it's got a

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
ways to go usually these sorts of things take a while.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
And so I wanted to kind of reduce my typing a bit and so I felt like

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,200
it probably wasn't a good idea to do handmade here for a little bit.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,100
So I took some time off of that but I also tried and I'm not sure how

58
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,400
this is going to go, but I decided to try.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Perhaps changing my keyboard setup for emacs to be modal.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
And I'm not sure about that yet.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,700
I tried it.

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm playing with it now that it's it's not too bad.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,500
It's I don't think modal is as good as non-modal completely honest

64
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:39,900
with you.

65
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,700
I'm just not sold on it.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
I apologize to VI users.

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,700
I know obviously, if you how users are pretty happy with mobile other

68
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,600
modal interfaces, otherwise they wouldn't use VI

69
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,200
Um, I'm not so sure, it's such a great idea, for Speed and their

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,000
reason for that is that I feel like there's just too much mental

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,400
overhead, that goes into knowing which mode that you're actually in

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,600
and that switching overhead does, cause quite a bit of a problem and

73
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,900
I'm sure that as I used it more, I will get faster at it.

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,500
Like I'm sure that would be true but I don't actually know.

75
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,500
That it will ever be as fast as non-mobile like, you know, could have

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,900
robot, do it as fast.

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Sure, but maybe a robot could even be faster but the degree to, which

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,100
I switch between entering things and Performing operations is

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,600
extremely granular.

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,000
So, often times, you get very few switching.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,600
A mode is is straight-up.

82
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,800
Just almost adding an additional key stroke, which is now you have to

83
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,400
switch into the mode.

84
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,700
Do the thing and switch out.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,700
And so I'm not really sure it's a plus.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,300
I may just not keep it.

87
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't really know so we'll see.

88
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,000
So I feel like at the moment I'm not sold on it.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,200
I did get emacs into a pretty reasonable state for being modal

90
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,300
actually.

91
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,700
And I found that, you know, there are some things I had to do, I had

92
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,400
to make it so it was very visible.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,500
Like, when I switch into the mode like,

94
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Change the color of the cursor, and I change it to highlight the line

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
and stuff.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,700
So, it was very clear, which mode you're in.

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,100
There's a bunch of stuff like that, that I found I kind of had to do

98
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,100
in order to make modal really work, but, you know, I can, I can more

99
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,600
or less use it.

100
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Now I'm much slower than I was and I don't really enjoy it and I don't

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
know that I'm ever going to, I'm not sure, so I'm not sure whether

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,700
I'll stick with it or not, but I did try that.

103
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,600
And so, we'll see.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
I also feel like I probably need to do some work on organic metrics

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,900
here but, you know, like I said, it's a, it's a thing in in it's in

106
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,500
progress.

107
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,100
So I don't know when I'm going to be 100% comfortable to actually

108
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
start coding on stream again.

109
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,800
But I figured at this point I should probably do a couple.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,500
Dreams a week regardless just because, hey, we can always chat about

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,000
stuff.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,500
And you know, even if they're not official, handmade hero things, we

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,900
can spend a half hour just doing whatever and my right hand is still

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,400
fine so I can, you know, still do stuff like drawing out on the on a

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Blackboard or things like that.

116
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,600
So that's the that's basically the current situation.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,500
And so I don't really have anything to add other than obviously, it's

118
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,300
pretty important to me to make sure that my hands were okay.

119
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
So no promises on when I will actually do a full programming stream

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,500
again because I need to both be confident that I'm okay, programming

121
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,000
wise.

122
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,000
And I also need to be fairly confident that I'm fast enough with

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
whatever keyboard setup, I choose to use to ensure that I'm, you know,

124
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,500
not going to be too slow to actually program effectively on stream and

125
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,700
talk, you know, at the same time and all that.

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
So,

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,100
What I would say I will keep you updated as to anything that I find

128
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,900
out because I know that a lot of people out there have RSI problems of

129
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,600
one kind of the other.

130
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,800
So anything that I find out that I think might help people in general,

131
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll be sure to pass on but I think in, you know, the sad fact of the

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,600
matter, I strongly suspect is that since everyone's musculature is

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,800
different, everyone's brain works different, everyone uses different

134
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,300
You know, keyboards and keyboard layouts, and, you know, to have an

135
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,800
ergonomic keyboard, user wrist, refuse risk, braces, do you use this

136
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,400
particular thing?

137
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,300
How fast do you type?

138
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,100
How often do you cut and paste?

139
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,500
You know, I feel like there's so many variables there.

140
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,600
And there are so poorly understood that I strongly.

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Suspect that one of the biggest problems with anything RSI related.

142
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Is simply that.

143
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,800
What's true for one person is not going to be true for another person.

144
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,600
What solves an RSI problem for me is not going to solve an RSI problem

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,500
for you and you know, maybe at some point we're lucky and you happen

146
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,900
to ask somebody what to do for RSI and they say x and it turns out

147
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
that X is also something that would work well for you for RSI.

148
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,600
You know, I have no idea.

149
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,400
So I really I really just don't know.

150
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,900
And like I said, I'll be sort of trying to work on that a little bit

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
going forward as we

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Go and I'll let you know if I figured find anything out that that is

153
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,400
at all relevant but that's the current state.

154
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,900
And so that's really all I have to say about that if that makes sense.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,900
So I strongly suspect no programming still for for several days and I

156
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,900
will you know post conspicuously if your folks don't want aren't

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
interested in hanging out for a half hour here or there.

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,700
I'll post pretty conspicuously on the Twitter when we will actually

159
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,400
start coding again.

160
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,000
The

161
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Active, that makes sense.

162
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,900
So yeah.

163
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,300
So with that said, I will go ahead and go to the Q&A here and grab

164
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,100
some questions.

165
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,700
The people were asking.

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,200
So Elvin asked a question and I suppose I should probably bring up the

167
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,700
the Blackboard here as well.

168
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,200
Oops, I didn't mean to do that.

169
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,900
Password, safe, which I don't even know why there is a password safe

170
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,500
on this machine right now, but apparently got moved and now I can't

171
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,200
move it back.

172
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
Oh, well, good, that's great.

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,900
We'll just leave it there no problem.

174
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,700
Let's just say it was a good place for it.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Windows thinks it was a good place for it.

176
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
And who are you to disagree?

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Sir?

178
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,000
Who indeed?

179
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, this is not particularly speedy.

180
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,500
There we go.

181
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,700
all right, so

182
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
Elvin asked a question.

183
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
And this is, this is about emulation speed.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,600
So, Alvin asked a question about emulation speed and basically, what

185
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,100
well, you know, what?

186
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,300
I don't actually know, I never know people's he's or she's, I think I

187
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,800
do know I love.

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,200
And I think it's a, he I should just, we need a, we need to like a

189
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
gender-neutral pronoun.

190
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,400
Because on a stream, if you see someone's handle, you have no idea if

191
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,200
they're male or female, right?

192
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,200
It's like it handles are almost completely genderless most of the time

193
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,400
and so unlike regular people's names, which typically, you can make a

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,100
very reasonable guess most of

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Time never invented yet.

196
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Anyway, point being Elvin asked why if you have something that is

197
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,100
obviously an underpowered computer relative to your host machine.

198
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,300
So if you have, for example, he was asking specifically about

199
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,500
simulating a GameCube.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,100
Which is a power PC.

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,300
Right.

202
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,200
So think like, you know, think Apple.

203
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:08,600
You know McIntosh from maybe I don't know 2001.

204
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Am I right?

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,800
I don't really remember what Circa powerpc would it have been a G4.

206
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,700
this is really taxing my memory so I don't really remember which

207
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,800
flavor the power, the power PC that's actually in the GameCube is a is

208
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:32,700
not is not the same chip obviously but it's similar like I feel like

209
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,800
it had all Tyvek

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Right?

211
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,200
Which is an instruction set that's Vector instruction set.

212
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,600
Like I simply like SSE.

213
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,700
So it's, it's a very old processor though.

214
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,500
I mean, the processor is, you know, it's over a decade old.

215
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,200
And so, I guess what he was trying to determine when he was asking the

216
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,300
question is, why is something, you know, that's, that's why or

217
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,200
something over 10 years old.

218
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Why is it slow to emulate?

219
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,400
Today.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,900
And the answer to that question is actually that it depends very, very

221
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,700
specifically on what you're trying to emulate why it is slow but I can

222
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,400
try to give you a general appreciation for some reasons why?

223
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Something might be slow when you emulate it.

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,600
If the hardware itself is not all that fast.

225
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,100
Right.

226
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,000
Okay, so let's talk about a few aspects of this.

227
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,800
So, first of all, let's talk about single thread speed.

228
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,600
So single thread execution, right?

229
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,400
On a any CPU single thread, execution used to get faster every year,

230
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,200
right?

231
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,200
And so if you actually looked at the speed that which things were

232
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,200
executing it, actually, you know, you could almost use the megahertz

233
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,000
as a pretty good indication of how fast things were going and, you

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
know, if you go back to back when I was a kid, you know, and not even

235
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
actually when I was probably a teenager so

236
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,500
This, you know, you might have a machine that was like eight

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
megahertz, right?

238
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,700
And then you, you talked about that in the, you know, in the early 90s

239
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,500
or something like that and then you kind of talk about something that

240
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
was maybe the year 2000, right?

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,200
And something in the year 2000 was like a gigahertz perhaps, right?

242
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,800
So, you look at the clock speeds here, and it was, it was like this

243
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,400
kind of a thing, right?

244
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,600
It was like, it was a straight-up exponential curve where things were

245
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
getting twice as fast all the time.

246
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,300
Twice, twice, twice twice and they were just escalating super rapidly,

247
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,900
right?

248
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,600
But then around 4 GHz this topped out completely, so this curve like

249
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,900
went up and then it just like straight-up did that right?

250
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,500
And so while until at all and you know, for various reasons people

251
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,700
were able to continue

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Sort of getting some speed increases in single threaded execution,

253
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:17,600
most of the execution speed ceased to come in single threaded, speed,

254
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,000
that sort of stopped happening.

255
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,200
Core count started going up memory speed.

256
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,700
So in terms of the single threaded execution memory, speed more cash,

257
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,500
basically eliminating, the bottlenecks of memory started becoming

258
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,800
somebody could do, but the actual speed of the instructions was not

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
Any faster if that makes sense.

260
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,900
Like you were, you were sort of starting to hit this this limit of

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,500
what you could do.

262
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
And so it was creeping up at a much lower rate.

263
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,600
And so maybe they could do things like remove a clock cycle or two

264
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,100
from this or clock cycle, free from that.

265
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
And, you know, he's sort of cute cities to get faster, but it's not

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,700
nearly in the, in the sort of direct way that it that it used to.

267
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,800
So nowadays, the first thing that you have to

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,900
Shape is that when you talk about simulating something from, I don't

269
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,100
know when it was, right.

270
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,400
If you talk about something stimulating, something from in here, and

271
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,300
you're talking about simulating it in here, there's a very big

272
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,000
difference in terms of being able to emulate stuff across this Gap.

273
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Then there would have been across this Gap, right?

274
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,500
Because if you look at the Gap back here, the degree to which single

275
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,400
threaded execution, was faster, was dramatic like really, really

276
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,000
dramatic.

277
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,600
Okay.

278
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,500
Why does this matter?

279
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,400
Well, first of all, if you are emulating something,

280
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Emulating something, you can't Auto paralyzed.

281
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Write the code that you're emulating for on a dolphin is like either

282
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,800
single threaded or to threaten.

283
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,100
I think it's only single threaded.

284
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,100
I can't remember what that ship did I have no, I can't remember

285
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
whether there was a second thread under or not.

286
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,300
So the GameCube was at one thread.

287
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,700
Was it to thread point being however, many threads it was, it was

288
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,900
either one or two.

289
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,100
I think it was one, but don't quote me on that.

290
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,300
You can't, if you have four cores with to hyper threads, each you

291
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,000
can't somehow turn that single-threaded workload or two or dual

292
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,100
threaded workload.

293
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,700
You can't magically turn that into an 8 thread workload.

294
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,600
That's just not possible for the emulator to do, right?

295
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,200
It would require analyzing the complete code and like doing all kinds

296
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,300
of Auto parallelizing stuff that's actually like an open research

297
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,600
topic to this day, how to like properly take completely single

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
threaded code and think about it and turn it into multi-threaded,

299
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,000
right?

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,500
That's a really

301
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,100
Hard problem.

302
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,800
So, your average run-of-the-mill emulator is not going to be able to

303
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
be doing anything like that.

304
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,300
That's, you know, maybe in a very limited certain cases, it could do

305
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,500
it, but very, very difficult.

306
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,700
So the degree to which you're getting that speed increase.

307
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,200
It's not as big as you think, right?

308
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,700
So that's the first thing to appreciate.

309
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,800
I don't want to suggest that somehow your single trade execution today

310
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,000
is the same as it was on a GameCube.

311
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,700
I'm not trying to say that at all, like I said, memory got a lot

312
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,200
faster.

313
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,400
There's there's a lot of reasons why it will get faster.

314
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I'm just trying to say, I appreciate the fact that it's not as fast as

315
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,900
you might have thought it was, okay?

316
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,900
So that's that's thing one, alright?

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,599
So that's thing one and then think to, in fact, so let me just write

318
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,000
these down.

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,500
So number one CPUs today, aren't

320
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,599
Much faster.

321
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,300
At straight.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,900
Wine code.

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,300
Right.

324
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,500
So, just by Just, Gotta execute a series of instructions.

325
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Today's CPUs just aren't that much faster right there faster, but they

326
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,200
aren't as much faster as you expected in the old days.

327
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,500
You might have said, oh, you know, it's it's you look at between here

328
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
and here you look at the Richmond 8 MHz + 1 gigahertz alone, right?

329
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,800
You're talking about 100 times faster.

330
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,200
That's not true in a single thread of execution on today's machines,

331
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,800
probably isn't a hundred times faster than it was.

332
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,900
On a dolphin, right?

333
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,800
So, if you look at an emulator for something, like the Amiga,

334
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,100
And you look at what we could emulate on the Amiga on a 1 GHz machine.

335
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,500
Let's say maybe it seemed to do a really good job.

336
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,100
You're like, well, that's a very complicated computer.

337
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
How was that able to do it?

338
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
And now this Dalton thing.

339
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,600
Can't, we can't do it or whatever.

340
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Well that's you know, not comparing Apples to Apples.

341
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,900
You're comparing apples to oranges because the single depart that an

342
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,300
emulator actually cares about which is the single threaded code

343
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,500
execution that part simply didn't get as much faster in the past 10

344
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,200
years as it did the 10 years before that and the 10 years before that,

345
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
we've been on the increasingly.

346
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,300
Sort of pessimistic curve for single threaded, code execution.

347
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,600
As things start to become more about getting more cores, more threads

348
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,700
wider instructions.

349
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,100
Right.

350
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
That's another thing I can't do it.

351
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,300
Can't widen the instructions.

352
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,300
They can't use Cindy, because it would have to analyze an auto

353
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,800
symbolize.

354
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Again, a very difficult process.

355
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,900
So that's thing, one thing, two, of course.

356
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,000
So you might say well okay so they aren't getting as much faster as

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
they used to perhaps but they're still obviously faster.

358
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,900
Right.

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,100
There's no question we would never say that a core i7 from today or

360
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,200
something like this is not significantly faster still then a dolphin

361
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,300
from the GameCube obviously it is right.

362
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,400
That's definitely true.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,100
So the question is, if it's obviously faster, why is it having trouble

364
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:21,900
emulating this thing?

365
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,100
Like if it's faster, it should just be able

366
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:24,900
Emulate it, right?

367
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,000
A faster CPU should be able to emulate a source of you.

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, the reason for that, of course, is that emulation

369
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,300
Requires.

370
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,200
Emulation.

371
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,400
Emulation is not the same thing as running code.

372
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,700
Emulation means that a particular CPU that you're talking about and

373
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,500
it's all the stuff that it does.

374
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,100
Must be recreated accurately enough.

375
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,900
That the program that is running on it cannot tell the difference

376
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,300
between that and the actual hardware and when I say tell the

377
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,100
difference, I don't mean antagonistic way.

378
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:10,400
I'm not saying that it's looking for it, but in a de facto it is so.

379
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,500
And

380
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,700
What do I mean by that?

381
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,400
What I mean by that is if you imagine

382
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,100
that we have let's say we have a simple spec, okay?

383
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,300
So let's say we have a simple spec and this is maybe just the

384
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,800
instruction set of the of the dolphin of the GameCube.

385
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,600
Okay.

386
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,100
We have this simple spec and we're just like okay we give all the

387
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,000
developers.

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This simple spec, the compiler generates code to this spec, right?

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,800
That's what happened.

390
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,200
When people made a GameCube game.

391
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,500
That's what happened.

392
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,800
So all we need to do is take the simple spec and emulate the simple

393
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,400
spec and then we will have the equivalent of a dolphin CPU running and

394
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,000
can run all the dolphin things right?

395
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,000
And that is not even remotely.

396
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,800
True not

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Even remotely.

398
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,000
True.

399
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
Why is that not even really true.

400
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,600
It's not even remotely true because nobody actually codes to the spec,

401
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,400
okay?

402
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,300
It doesn't mean they're not trying to go to the spec.

403
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,700
It does mean the compiler is not trying to Output suspect.

404
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,700
What it means is that nobody actually is running anything on the spec

405
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,100
they are running everything on the actual dolphin with all of its

406
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Hardware bugs.

407
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,100
All of its Hardware idiosyncrasies

408
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,900
And all the programmer knows after he writes his code, right?

409
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,600
He looks at what he's supposed to write.

410
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,900
He writes his code and then he starts running on the dolphin all he

411
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,600
knows,

412
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,100
Is whether it worked.

413
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,600
Right?

414
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,700
And that's all you need to know.

415
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,300
Once the code appears to be working properly, he believes that he has

416
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,000
properly created or she in this case, she might believe that she is

417
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
properly, created something to run on the dolphin and you know what

418
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
she's right she did she will ship that and everyone who is able to

419
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,100
play it on there you know GameCube confirms that fact but what

420
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,400
actually happened there what actually happened there was this was a

421
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,700
huge

422
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,100
Of code and probably it relied on some weird undocumented aspects of

423
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,500
this thing.

424
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Like sometimes when you do a particular thing, it takes a little

425
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
longer than it used to and that happened to be just enough time to

426
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,000
make sure that some dolphin GPU thing that was submitted completed

427
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,800
when it wouldn't have completed otherwise.

428
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,000
And so there's no bug and they never see a bug.

429
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,200
They had one but they never see it because technically they don't

430
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,900
really have one because some aspect of a dolphin Hardware is masking

431
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,600
that bug.

432
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,700
Thereby making it effective.

433
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,200
Lee not a bug, right?

434
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,500
But now what you have done is you've produced code that rely

435
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,300
specifically on exactly how the dolphin CPU functioned.

436
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,800
So what does this mean?

437
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,400
When you start to look at it across millions and millions of lines of

438
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
code, tons of programmers.

439
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,100
He wrote this, she wrote this, they wrote this right, all of these

440
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,900
programs, how many GameCube games were there?

441
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
Tons of GameCube games, right?

442
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Well effectively what you're doing essentially, this is you could

443
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,700
think of is almost like a genetic engineering process, right?

444
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,200
It's basically hammering just like nature does when it creates random

445
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,300
mutations, right?

446
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,200
It's basically hammering on this Hardware with every last piece of

447
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,700
code that people tried to make and eventually you've got some code

448
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,300
somewhere in some game that relies on every last little thing.

449
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,900
That this thing did weird every last little cycle discrepancy every

450
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
last little quirky weird way.

451
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,200
If it had a divided bug in it, if it had, you know, a

452
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,200
A weird like stall.

453
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,300
Something particular that happened with the cash, something where a

454
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,800
value.

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Get cleared in a register every last one of those.

456
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
There's a game up here that relied on it.

457
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:12,000
So now what that means is in order to actually write the emulation,

458
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,400
you must actually emulate this actual physical device, not the speck.

459
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,900
So it is not a simple matter of loading, a bunch of code, binary

460
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,100
translating it from, you know, powerpc to x64 and then executing it.

461
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,600
That's simply not the case.

462
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,900
What actually has to happen is you have to build essentially a virtual

463
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,000
CPU model and a virtual GPU model, right?

464
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,800
And it's virtual motherboard model,

465
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,500
You have to build these virtual models and you actually have to

466
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,300
simulate all of their defects all of their idiosyncrasies, all of

467
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
their specified weirdness, right?

468
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,800
Because there's stuff in the spec that might still be very hard for an

469
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
ecstasy for to emulate.

470
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,800
It might take 30 instructions, it might take interrupt you, who knows

471
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,400
what it would take to accurately recreate, what's happening inside

472
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
this this, this machine, right?

473
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,700
It has to create all of this and then essentially run these

474
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,800
Virtual CPUs, it's not simply running the code, so who knows how

475
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,800
complicated that could be something very, very simple on the Dalton

476
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,400
CPU and interrupt that fires when the GPU is full of something, who

477
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:27,800
knows?

478
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,100
I have no idea right now, suddenly has to be emulated in this world,

479
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,200
where those things aren't actually running in Harbor.

480
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,000
There is no such thing as the GPU interrupt happening in hardware for

481
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,600
this particular thing.

482
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,700
So that's all simulated hundreds, and hundreds of hundreds of

483
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,600
Instructions, getting executed potentially on the xt4 to simulate one

484
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:47,900
thing.

485
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,700
That didn't take any instructions on the dolphin, it just happened,

486
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,400
right?

487
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,500
And all of those timings have to be correct.

488
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Because in any way, if they diverged from what actually happened on

489
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,800
the dolphin, you will no longer be able to run all the games that ran

490
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,600
on the dolphin.

491
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,000
And that's just the sad truth of it, right?

492
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,600
So, in emulator, authors job is very difficult, indeed.

493
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,200
And hopefully, this gives you a little bit of perspective on why it's

494
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
not just straight forward.

495
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,600
Because if it was literally the case,

496
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,500
That we had some powerpc code here, right?

497
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,600
And we had some x64 code here and we just took it and we just like,

498
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,000
you know, we just translated it.

499
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,600
Sure there's no chance like, I refuse to believe.

500
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
I mean, I don't remember the power PCS instruction set that, well, but

501
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,600
I refuse to believe there's any chance that wouldn't run significantly

502
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,800
faster.

503
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,500
Okay, you could just do it and it may be done.

504
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,600
But, unfortunately, that is simply not the problem that we're looking

505
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:48,800
at.

506
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,700
It's the fact that the x 64 now needs to,

507
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,700
To simulate a CPU and GPU and other peripheral components inside

508
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,200
itself, and it needs to do it.

509
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,700
Incredibly accurately that

510
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,700
It's a really big hurdle for emulation authors to overcome.

511
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,300
And so, you know, does that mean you couldn't still create a thing

512
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,800
that would do this, right?

513
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,500
No, it just means if you actually wanted the thing that like binary

514
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,300
translates, all whole game over and then runs it like, almost at

515
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,000
Native speeds, like x64 style speeds modern computer speeds.

516
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,800
That's just an incredibly hard review, know, sort of like artificial

517
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,900
intelligent reverse.

518
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,800
Veneering.

519
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,800
Sort of translation problem thing.

520
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,800
That just you know that's not what at your average emulator is going

521
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
to be able to do or if might not even be possible, right?

522
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I mean, you get into probably nasty computer science thing is like

523
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,700
halting problem sort of stuff there where you're like, okay it's a

524
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,500
program.

525
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
We don't even know how to analyze it that.

526
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,700
Well, like, you know, it's really difficult to sort of figure out when

527
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,100
interrupts would have happened in here and how to insert the code that

528
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,800
would automatically know.

529
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,300
Just it's really pretty, pretty crazy, right?

530
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,400
So hopefully that gives you some perspective that said, I have never

531
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,700
looked at Dolphin emulation so, you know, maybe it's actually not too

532
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,000
bad.

533
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Maybe there aren't that many idiosyncrasies of that particular

534
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,600
machine, maybe it was very clean.

535
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,500
There's very simple.

536
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,400
And if that was the case, then maybe the Dolphin Emulator is just

537
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
lousy, right?

538
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,800
I mean there's the substance such a thing is just it's not coated well

539
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,200
for Speed or who knows, right.

540
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,700
So I don't know and I'm not going to try to speculate on someone

541
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
else's emulator code but

542
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,200
It's certainly plausible that even if the emulator authors did a good

543
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,900
job, there's plenty of reasons why it might not be the case that you

544
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,600
get reasonable performance on a machine that you might think you

545
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,200
should, you might need a lot of extra performance to actually get it

546
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:47,700
to work.

547
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,400
Right?

548
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
Let's see.

549
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,100
Let us see able to use thumbs thumbsticks.

550
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,000
Wonder if one could map common stuff to controller for programming,

551
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
language to program via controller.

552
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,400
Yeah, I don't know, like I said, it's a little bit too early for me to

553
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,700
make any real determinations yet, so I just don't know.

554
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,000
Like I said as soon as I kind of have a more solid idea of exactly

555
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,600
what's going to happen.

556
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,500
I will I will.

557
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,700
Let you know.

558
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,500
Mr.

559
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,100
Fourth dimension.

560
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,200
I'm working on a sort of experimental alternative to Mo's that reduces

561
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
probably eliminates key holding to you.

562
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,500
I think that's part of the problem for you.

563
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Like I said, I really just don't know and I would love to see that.

564
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,800
I'd love to see what you got because like I mean as you know I'm a

565
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,200
really big fan of your editor so far and I feel like if you've got an

566
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,600
idea it's probably a good one or at the very least it's probably worth

567
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,700
trying and I think one of the big problems is our size.

568
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,600
It's really hard to tell, what is it, isn't causing it right?

569
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,100
And so sometimes the best bet is to just try to, you know, do as much

570
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,600
as you can.

571
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,900
And so,

572
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,700
So I'd be willing to play around with whatever you've got just to see,

573
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,900
you know, if it helps right.

574
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,000
I mean I feel like everyone's kind of that way.

575
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,700
We're all trying to experiment to find things that might help.

576
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,000
So I'd love to see it if you're working on it.

577
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,100
In Janeiro.

578
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,500
Could these streams be a good time for some C++ tutorials or something

579
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,900
similar?

580
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,900
You mean like if I did like the beginner like how beginner's guide to

581
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,700
see, I suppose I could try because it maybe isn't as much typing

582
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:00,800
there.

583
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,400
We'll see.

584
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I want to wait.

585
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,000
I want to do a week or so of just we'll chat and I want to have a

586
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,800
chance to go back to physical therapy again and we'll see I'm, it's a

587
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,600
little premature for me to know how long I'll actually to be outer.

588
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,500
What's going on here?

589
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,000
So, I have some more work I need to do just

590
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
Just as Baseline there.

591
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,300
Captain craft.

592
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
How much of the renderer that you wrote for handmade.

593
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,700
Here will be replaced when you move fully into opengl.

594
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,100
We pretty much are fully in opengl already.

595
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,300
We render everything through opengl.

596
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
The only thing we didn't do with textures.

597
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,600
Ratchet freak.

598
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,800
I mean we did the texture.

599
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,100
Find we didn't do the overlap download of textures ratchet freak.

600
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,300
Right.

601
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,100
Click and remove from list to remove keepass know.

602
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,900
I didn't want to remove it.

603
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,600
I wanted it there.

604
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,900
I just wanted down at the bottom, but I guess maybe that was the

605
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,700
faster the shortcut thing.

606
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,400
I don't even care.

607
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,500
In fact, are they they is gender neutral.

608
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,300
Yeah, you know, I do kind of like they for gender-neutral I use it

609
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,400
when I'm writing I guess I should just do it when I'm talking.

610
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,300
I never use it when I'm talking for some reason, but I do use it when

611
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,200
I'm when I'm writing.

612
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,700
And so maybe I'll just use it for talking.

613
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,000
Our be any LR, I'm working through some opengl tutorials, at the

614
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,500
moment and a matte quaternions now.

615
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
Okay, cool.

616
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,500
Ryan Roth, whether opinions on stand-up desk.

617
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I recently switched to one of my hands feel noticeably better, you

618
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,400
know, I've never tried it for hands, I did have a problem with my hip

619
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,800
a while back well my knee really sort of hard to describe but

620
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,400
And I have a standing desk for that so I can try it.

621
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,200
I don't need it for the knee at the moment but I could try putting it

622
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,500
up.

623
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,200
I have got right.

624
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,900
What I did find is that I can't program for that long at it.

625
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,500
My back gets a little sore trying to stand for that long and as do my

626
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,300
feet.

627
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
But but I never really tried it for hands, so I may

628
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
I could certainly go to Schatzi.

629
00:32:59,600 --> 00:32:59,800
I've been.

630
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
Reading on early computer Graphics, technology 60s and 70s, any

631
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,500
thoughts on the topic?

632
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Not really, I don't know that much about 60s and 70s Graphics

633
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,100
technology.

634
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,500
I mean, that's the early stuff, right?

635
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,100
When I'm really, really early.

636
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,700
I don't know much about, that's like spaceward stuff, right?

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,900
She was Captain crafts.

638
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,000
You mentioned before that there are great programmers that have very

639
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,700
different skill sets.

640
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,000
What skill sets is your strongest did you actively try to get better

641
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
at it or just naturally fall into that skill set?

642
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,400
I would say I feel like API design is my my strongest skill set.

643
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:02,900
I would say, I would say that's typically, I tend to find that.

644
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,000
You know, if I was like, well, you're going to in what situation would

645
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
you pick yourself rather than somebody else to code?

646
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:12,900
This thing?

647
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,300
If you could pick anyone in the world API design is almost always.

648
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:22,100
I have yet to see someone who I think does as good as good as

649
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,199
thorough, as job on those as I do.

650
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:32,300
And so, I would say that's probably it and yeah, because like most

651
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,000
things like optimization, I'd rather pick somebody else than me.

652
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
Working with other people's code, I'd rather pick up.

653
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,900
I could think of other people, I would pick.

654
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,300
I tend to be really good at

655
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,400
At sort of first pass solutions to things too.

656
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,900
Like if you have a problem that people don't actually know how to

657
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,400
solve yet and it just needs to get solved.

658
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm usually pretty good at that too, like new Solutions and they're

659
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,800
typically probably not going to be the best solution like someone will

660
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,800
come along after me and usually do a better one but like kind of

661
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,800
getting in there in a situation where there's really, no one really

662
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,900
knows exactly what's going on.

663
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,700
I can also usually make sense of those pretty well.

664
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,700
I,

665
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,100
I would say.

666
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
The size of dolphin is the emulator.

667
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,700
Not the chip.

668
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,300
No dolphin is actually the name of the platform so dolphin was the

669
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
name of the Game Cube before they called it the GameCube.

670
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,900
So like the internal name is is Dolphin.

671
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,800
You can see here

672
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,900
Where is the actual?

673
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,300
Well?

674
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:58,500
Rap.

675
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
At the time, we all called it dolphin because I don't think they had

676
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,200
actually named it GameCube when we actually had the, you know, the dev

677
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
kits and stuff at rad.

678
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,400
So it was always the dolphin, the dolphin, this, the dolphin that.

679
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
So I still use that that name.

680
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,100
I assume that they use that name for the emulator because that was the

681
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,600
code name for the box, but it would be weird if that wasn't the case.

682
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,500
And so yeah.

683
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,000
Chrome Dragon.

684
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
That's why every part is label the dolphin because it was, it was like

685
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,700
the dolphin CPU, dolphin GPU.

686
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,700
That's what we called it.

687
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,500
K.

688
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,300
Thanks for the great answer.

689
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,700
Regarding my question about rotation scaling, apologies, but I wasn't

690
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,000
able to find the time to research it and hammy hiroko due to my foot

691
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,300
on it.

692
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,400
Dude, you have like three weeks

693
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,900
The question was, how does scale rotation play nice together for

694
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,700
tations are stored at the first of our three dude?

695
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,800
What are you even talking about?

696
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,200
I have a full-time job.

697
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,300
Lame.

698
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,400
What are you even talking about?

699
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,600
You got to go back, you got to go back and look at it.

700
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,100
Go back and look at the code where we do rotation and we had scaling

701
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,400
in there, when we did the thing where we originally did.

702
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,100
Right before, you know, when we were doing the texture mapping, it's

703
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,700
still in there, the code still in there.

704
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,400
I'll draw it out anyway.

705
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
And biggest Panda.

706
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,500
Ever have to write accessibility features for people with disabilities

707
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,400
like RSI.

708
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,000
No.

709
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Except I guess.

710
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,500
Yes.

711
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,600
Now me

712
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,800
And so, you know, I guess I'll be learning about that for no apparent

713
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,300
reason other than I am.

714
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,700
Now a disability.

715
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,500
Boondoggle, 42 since John Blow soliciting for program Integrity Jay, I

716
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
would you be interested in being involved in any way.

717
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,300
I think he's looking for actually like people to go program out

718
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,100
full-time which obviously I'm not going to do because I've got too

719
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,600
much stuff at the moment, but symbolic.

720
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,300
But what do you think, about model view controller pattern?

721
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,300
If you already read about this, feel free to ignore the question.

722
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,500
I didn't rant about it, I think I said that, I feel like model view

723
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,300
controller is not too far from a reasonable way from, okay.

724
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Is there a couple things that are a little bit that I think are a

725
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,100
little bit confusing about the way they phrase it but it's not bad.

726
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,400
Sean McGrath specific to me.

727
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,100
So feel free to skip.

728
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,200
Remember that grid was really determination thing.

729
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,300
I spent two minutes, think about it?

730
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300
I think just for 8 bit numbers.

731
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,100
Indicating how far in each cardinal direction you can see from that

732
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,200
cell solves, everything, four bytes for sale easy-peasy

733
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,800
I don't really understand why that solves the problem, but

734
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
I'm not really sure I ever really understood the problem, you're

735
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,400
trying to solve, so there's that

736
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,600
Aaliyah Christian, in the First videos, you mentioned that you won't

737
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
use anything like opengl.

738
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,500
Did you change your mind on the way?

739
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,700
I don't do.

740
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,400
We actually mention that.

741
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,700
I mean, we did, we did the whole renderer without it, open Jill.

742
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,100
And, but I feel like I always said, we're going to Hardware

743
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:22,500
acceleration.

744
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,100
Originally, I assumed we would do is, you would use Vulcan but I

745
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,600
strongly dislike the architecture for these new graphics apis like d3d

746
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,400
12 and, and mantle and so on.

747
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,200
So I think

748
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,400
Probably won't do them because I don't like them and don't really want

749
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,500
to encourage people to use them because I think they're bad.

750
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,200
/ act looks like Silicon Valley.

751
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,300
Bubble is bursting.

752
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,100
I don't know what that means, but it's about time.

753
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,700
I mean I don't know why people put so much money into things that

754
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,300
don't even make money, but you know, advertising isn't as big a

755
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,700
business.

756
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,900
As people think it is in my opinion and Rudi our has the RSI been

757
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,600
putting a damper on your work at my rock as well.

758
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,500
Yes, it has not because trying to switch to keyboard layouts.

759
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,400
I don't know what I'm going to do.

760
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
It's a problem.

761
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,100
It's a very big problem.

762
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,600
and,

763
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,600
And I'm not sure exactly what to do with it because I don't actually

764
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,900
know what specifically the problem is yet.

765
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't know where the problems actually coming from.

766
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,500
I don't know if it's specific to typing the at the wrists or if it's

767
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,900
like, you know, because problems with the nerve, you kid can come from

768
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,800
anywhere, right?

769
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,600
You can have a problem with a nerve in your neck, you can have it

770
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,800
anywhere from the brain down, right?

771
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,800
You can have a problem in your neck, you can have a problem in your

772
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,000
shoulder.

773
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
You can have a problem at your elbow, you can have a problem even in

774
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:42,600
your

775
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,400
Arm.

776
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,800
You can have a problem in the hand at the wrist so I really just don't

777
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,700
know what to do at this point and so it's a little bit of a holding

778
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,800
pattern but and I have not really tried.

779
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,200
Funkier going to metric keyboards.

780
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,000
I tried typing on some sort of the, the Microsoft, or the, or the

781
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,100
split ones before, and I found that those didn't help that was before

782
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,900
I had risk braces.

783
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,700
I feel like their wrist brace has helped, like, made things fine for

784
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,800
me actually, and if the keyboard

785
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,700
Didn't help.

786
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,800
But that was a separate problem from this one.

787
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,100
So now I don't like I said, I don't know.

788
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,400
It could be that a learner who would help and we'll have to see as I

789
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,600
go for further.

790
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,200
Kemo sabe que si si knowledge nugget to, to Contour, not to const.

791
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:41,200
So I talked about that actually talked about that before my opinion on

792
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,600
const.

793
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,900
I don't use it, but it's I'm not against const.

794
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Specifically.

795
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,100
My opinion on cost is that I don't tend to make very many bugs that

796
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:53,500
contest.

797
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,200
Catches

798
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,900
If that like that just you know, sort of the way I phrased it.

799
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,700
When I answered it.

800
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,100
For and it's still kind of my opinion on it is is basically you want

801
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,500
to do things that catch the bugs, you have, right?

802
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,600
You want to do things to catch the bugs, you're likely to make.

803
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,200
And so I make a plenty of bugs and I can sort of name various

804
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,300
different kinds of bugs that I might have writing into a variable that

805
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,300
I wasn't opposed to writing to.

806
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,000
I almost never do you know, MIT, you know, once a year or something

807
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
like this, that happens to me.

808
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,700
Maybe right.

809
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
I think it's happened once on this entire on.

810
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,800
All of hand.

811
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,900
A hero and that's when I can't even pay attention to the code.

812
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,500
That's what I'm talking the whole time, right?

813
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,100
And so cons to me is just a waste of time because it doesn't help me,

814
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,000
right?

815
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,500
It's just extra typing that just waste my time.

816
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,900
And so, for me not using cost is a no-brainer, right?

817
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,300
It does, it would make no sense, it's literally just straight-up

818
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,700
stupid for me to ever type constant.

819
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,200
In my code that said, not, everyone makes them kind of bugs, right?

820
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,000
Bugs that I am liability liable to make in my code, may not be bugs at

821
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,500
your level because your code and vice versa.

822
00:42:59,700 --> 00:42:59,800
So,

823
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,100
You may find that you often make the mistake of writing into a

824
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,400
variable you weren't supposed to right to, right?

825
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,400
And if you find that you have made this a cost may be worth it for

826
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,600
you.

827
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,400
If you can help cut down on those bugs and those are the bugs.

828
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,800
You tend to make the extra typing may be worth it, right?

829
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,500
And so pretty much every language speakers.

830
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:17,700
Sure.

831
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Like costs, which really doesn't do anything.

832
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,600
A lot of people think Concepts opposition, it doesn't really there's

833
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,600
like one or two very rare cases that concert ever helps you and they

834
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,400
mostly don't.

835
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,400
So with something like costs that's like a, you know,

836
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,800
It's like a language contract.

837
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
That strictly there for your benefit, basically.

838
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,300
Your choice to use.

839
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,600
It has to be based on whether you think it's saving you time and only

840
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,400
you know that because what saves me time may not be what saves you

841
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,300
time and so you need to know that it's actually saving you time and

842
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,100
don't take my word for whether I use it as indicating that you should

843
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,000
or shouldn't because it's the, it's going to be different for you.

844
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,500
K.

845
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,400
So one of the main problems is not that we're not fast enough, but

846
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,100
probably not accurate enough and emulation.

847
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,000
But at the Docks were pretty clear about everything really to the

848
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,700
hardware, the specs etcetera, where they really go down detailed

849
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,000
swing.

850
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,700
How everything works?

851
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,400
Wouldn't that make the life of emulator authors easier?

852
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,100
So Elven it would make it their lives easier because they know exactly

853
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,400
what to emulate, but doesn't necessarily mean that the emulation

854
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,200
getting faster because even once you know, exactly all the

855
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
idiosyncrasies of the machine and exactly how it works.

856
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,000
They still may be very expensive to simulate

857
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,600
Right?

858
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,500
So in order to actually make those things, reproducible, you may need

859
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,900
thousands and thousands of x64 instructions to reproduce one thing

860
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,800
that the GameCube did instantaneously, right?

861
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,500
And you just, that's just the nature of simulating Hardware with other

862
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,000
Hardware.

863
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,100
You, you if you have a mismatch in how that harder Works, what you

864
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,600
always do, how expensive it is to simulate the other kind can, you

865
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,800
know, it may have nothing to do with whether, you know.

866
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,500
How it works.

867
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
It's not what knowing that matters.

868
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,500
It's can you do it?

869
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
In a reasonably efficient way, right?

870
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
P fo G.

871
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,400
Now that I'm playing the witness.

872
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,200
Would you explain again?

873
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
What part you worked on sure.

874
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:19,400
so I did a couple things I did the movement system, I did all that I

875
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,300
did the bunch of work on the grass planting

876
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,500
I did a bunch of work on the editor and, and I think that's about it.

877
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,000
Most of the work I did is in editor side stuff but then I did a bunch

878
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,800
of work on the movement.

879
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,300
So moving the character around is entirely me pretty much except for

880
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,900
the part that sits just above it and decides like the walk speed and

881
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,400
stuff is John's code.

882
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,800
Like John wrote code, that's like how he wanted to feel when you move.

883
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,500
So he just says, like I want to go this far or whatever, and then I

884
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,200
did the code that does all the Collision detection in the all, you

885
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,600
know, all the stuff that actually has a deal with moving you around

886
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:02,900
properly.

887
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,400
And making sure you bump into things and all that sort of stuff.

888
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,900
Long billion.

889
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,400
I'm thinking, being a sewing machine, pedal for mode switching, Envy.

890
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,900
I am.

891
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,900
Yeah, it might be good, especially in v.

892
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,100
I Am.

893
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,200
When you have this really heavy toggle, right?

894
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,600
I could see that being valuable, they have foot switches that you can

895
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,500
buy Triple foot switches and single foot switches.

896
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,600
There's a bunch of different foot pedal, USB foot pedal vendors out

897
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,500
there a calc any suggestions on the ideal computer chair and settings

898
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,100
for programming, I tend to have problems with the backs of my legs.

899
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,600
I've actually been using one of those rubber exercise balls as a

900
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,500
chair, which works.

901
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,600
But isn't the most control thing?

902
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,400
I don't have any suggestion that I mean, like I said, I have RSI.

903
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,000
So my suggestions are pretty worthless because obviously, whatever I'm

904
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,200
doing is not particularly great.

905
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,400
But here's what I would say, legs wise, exercising and stretching your

906
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,000
legs is often times, pretty important, if you sit all day.

907
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,600
And so one of the problems you may have and you may want to look into

908
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,400
again, if you can see a good physical therapist, I'm like that, who

909
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,100
could help you with that.

910
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,700
At but building up an exercise routine, I exercise everyday for my

911
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:16,900
legs like I do stretches for them for no reason, other than it

912
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,700
prevents problems that I had with my legs as far as I can tell, and

913
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,900
it's worked pretty well so far.

914
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:27,400
And so, I would say, I don't know, and I can't couldn't really say,

915
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,200
but I'd say, if you can find someone look into potentially exercises

916
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,100
that are specifically designed to stretch out, you know, like your get

917
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,100
good, a good stretch.

918
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,200
Each for your legs so that they're less susceptible to problems when

919
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,000
sitting because sitting all the time is tough on legs if they're not

920
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,600
ready for it.

921
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,600
Do you know other Advanced algebra topics that became a thing in

922
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,700
modern programming like quaternions did?

923
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,000
In modern programming.

924
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,400
Sure, like all of cryptography is based on Advanced algebra stuff,

925
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,900
right?

926
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,000
You know, like division rings and mod.

927
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,900
And you know, number Theory, stuff, all that sort of thing is, is

928
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,900
pretty important.

929
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,700
I don't know exactly what you're looking for.

930
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:27,600
Is your qualifier, but you know, that would be probably a good

931
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,200
example.

932
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,300
I depending on what you're looking for Icarus, I thought about doing

933
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,900
electronics and creating custom keyboard for your issues.

934
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,000
Like I've got time though.

935
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,900
You know I mean I don't know how to learn.

936
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,600
That would be a lot of learning and

937
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,100
You know, I would, I would love it if I knew that, but I already have

938
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:45,800
no time.

939
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,900
You know, I'm already so strapped for time, I'll, it's really hard.

940
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,400
And so I do, there's no way I'd come up to speed in time, to, in the

941
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,300
time, I would need

942
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:58,500
Captain craft.

943
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,700
What kinds of jobs outside the game industry?

944
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,100
Translate well into game engine programming, I don't know.

945
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,900
It's kind of a unique field so I would say maybe you know if you're

946
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,200
like an offline rendering thing like let's say you work to the render

947
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,900
team for Pixar well.

948
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,000
Now you know a lot about rendering stuff and maybe you didn't quite

949
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,600
have to do it for 60 frames a second because that wasn't your goal but

950
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,400
you still care about a lot of the same thing.

951
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,300
So I suspect that would probably be like offline rendering guy.

952
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,800
Would probably be a good example of someone who wouldn't have trouble

953
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,000
translating into game industry.

954
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,700
There's some new things to think about and some old things you don't

955
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:44,800
have to think about and but you know it's a very similar discipline, I

956
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,200
don't know.

957
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,900
Captain craft.

958
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,000
You think the arm can ever catch up to desktop CPUs?

959
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,700
Or that it could be used as a good game platform sure.

960
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,800
Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised.

961
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,300
I mean.

962
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,300
My understanding was Apple's arm.

963
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,900
Implementation is now quite fast.

964
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,100
I don't know if it's x64 fast, but it's quite fast.

965
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,700
so, you know, yeah, I would suspect

966
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,900
that if you took apples arm core, and

967
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,000
And ran with it, you might be a make a good game machine out of that,

968
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,600
you know, doesn't seem far-fetched to me.

969
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,500
I don't study that.

970
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,500
I don't study arm and very much detail, and I'm also not an expert on

971
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,300
things like how instruction sets affect the maximum speed that things

972
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:44,600
can go.

973
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:51,300
But, you know, I think if you decided to make a high-power arm core,

974
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,600
you might be able to do something like that.

975
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,100
Yeah, sure.

976
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,800
Knock till what don't you like about the Vulcan dx12?

977
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,200
As I'm going to write up a series on that at some point, once Vulcans

978
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,000
actually out.

979
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,300
And so I'll talk more about that down the line.

980
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,000
Quarter Tron.

981
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,800
What about constant optimization possibilities?

982
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,900
Are there really aren't any optimization possibilities for concerts,

983
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,800
there's really only one and it's not a very interesting one, if that

984
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,300
makes sense.

985
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,500
It's it's basically because most of the time when you're in a function

986
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,700
and you get something past you as const, the compiler can't assume

987
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,700
that it's actually const because anyone could my actually modify its

988
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,800
in Cincy.

989
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,300
The spec allows you to cast the constant way.

990
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,000
Cost cast is the thing that's allowed

991
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,900
And so the only time that it actually helps you with optimization is

992
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,700
when the compiler can see that you yourself have made, the thing that

993
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,000
is constant, so it has to be made right there.

994
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,600
Can't be passed in or anything like that.

995
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,400
Can't be a pointer, right?

996
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,700
You've made the thing yourself.

997
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,200
It's an actual value and the compiler couldn't have figured out that

998
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
it doesn't get modified anywhere else.

999
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,600
So you have to then pass, it's a dress to somebody else and then do

1000
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,200
something with it.

1001
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,600
After the fact, that's the only

1002
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,700
I'm a compiler can actually use cons for optimization purposes.

1003
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:15,000
Any other time you can't do it and so it really doesn't help you very

1004
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,500
much.

1005
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,100
It almost never actually helps the compiler.

1006
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:20,700
Chandler.

1007
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,600
Carrots said that const as a concept doesn't even exist in the

1008
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,900
optimizer for llvm.

1009
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,600
So the only thing that actually happens is the front end.

1010
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,200
We'll do some transforms if it knows about const.

1011
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,000
In that specific case, I just said I think it will do the transform

1012
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,100
necessary to make sure that it just treats that value as a constant,

1013
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,200
but that's like it, the optimizer wasn't even think about it.

1014
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:46,700
K.

1015
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,600
I'm very sad to hear about your hands.

1016
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,500
I pray and wish you get well soon.

1017
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,600
Thank you very much.

1018
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,100
I am very sad about them too.

1019
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,700
I'm hoping that it doesn't lead to a long-term problem, but I never

1020
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,100
know.

1021
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,800
So, you know, I'm hoping that it gets better.

1022
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,200
I'm, and I'm trying

1023
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:13,800
Serious 33 around a 130 or so you said that opengl directory were out

1024
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,000
back waiting to be put down and that everyone would be using Vulcan

1025
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,800
based on your comments.

1026
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,100
Just now you no longer feel that way.

1027
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:18,700
Yeah.

1028
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,100
So my assumption and you know,

1029
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
Let me rephrase that.

1030
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,700
So,

1031
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,800
I guess I don't know that I don't feel that way still because I am

1032
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,700
quite afraid that actually opengl and d3d will still be put down and

1033
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,000
everyone will have to use Vulcan and or d3d 12 / metal or whatever.

1034
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,300
The thing is on your platform.

1035
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,400
I do kind of feel like that may still happen but what change was?

1036
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,600
I actually went and read up on them and I am no longer enthusiastic

1037
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,000
about that particular switch.

1038
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,200
There are a lot of things.

1039
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,700
Opengl is incredibly crafty at this.

1040
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,400
Way too much stuff in it, it desperately needs to be streamlined and

1041
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,400
revised.

1042
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,200
I assume that that is what Vulcan would be just like, I assumed that,

1043
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,600
you know, mantle was ostensibly designed thing.

1044
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,800
When I actually went and looked at them, I don't, I strongly disagree

1045
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,000
with almost every design decision that they made.

1046
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,400
And so now at this point I'm like I really don't know what to say.

1047
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,900
I'm pretty pessimistic about the future of 3D apis.

1048
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,500
I

1049
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:37,200
I think it's a disaster, it's a complete unmitigated disaster and and

1050
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,600
I don't know what I mean.

1051
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,600
I think we're just going to end up with absolutely horrible API that

1052
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,200
we all have to use going forward because they're all roughly the same.

1053
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,100
So, no matter which one you pick it, they made the same decisions and

1054
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,300
I think they were really bad decisions, that's what I haven't.

1055
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,400
Look, specifically at metal.

1056
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,800
that's the only one that I haven't actually read up on yet and so, you

1057
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,000
know, maybe it's fantastic I doubt it but

1058
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:12,300
Mmv 94, have you heard about the good do engine?

1059
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,000
Do you think it is a good tool for prototyping proof-of-concept?

1060
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,600
I know, I have not heard about the good oh engine.

1061
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,800
You Christian said, how do you and Jonathan Blow know each other?

1062
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,300
Are we met through Chris Hecker a long, long time ago?

1063
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,400
K any general tips suggestions on how to approach the code for a new

1064
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,200
project with little or no art done for it.

1065
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,500
Yet, we have almost a complete Game design document listing all the co

1066
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,400
stuff we need but there's so much stuff.

1067
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,600
It's tricky to figure out where and how to start.

1068
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,900
I guess I don't really have tips in that working from a design spec to

1069
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,800
make a game, is not something I really ever done.

1070
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,600
You know, that's not the typical way in which I've been involved in

1071
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,000
programming.

1072
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So, I don't know that I could really give you any advice, that

1073
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,900
wouldn't just be guessing.

1074
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:00,200
Me blow.

1075
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,900
Are you familiar with NG?

1076
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,900
I don't think so.

1077
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,700
In fact, reduced me to them in recently and I'm now addicted.

1078
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,000
No, I don't think, I know what that is.

1079
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:11,900
Long billion.

1080
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,300
You're probably the wrong person to ask, but you have any idea when,

1081
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,800
if the limit of the witness will get a Linux version waiting is hard.

1082
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:24,500
I have not heard anything about a Linux version, so I don't know.

1083
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,800
The trouble with Linux is not getting it running.

1084
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,600
Obviously, we could probably get the lytic the witness running in

1085
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,800
Linux in that very much time on our machine, right?

1086
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:39,200
The problem is when you then ship it to customers and have to deal

1087
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,700
with the support it's kind of

1088
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,400
Epic nightmare, especially on Linux were machines.

1089
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,000
Often times the audio just doesn't work of its own accord, let alone

1090
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,600
the audio in your game, right?

1091
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,500
And so it's just a really bad platform for shipping games.

1092
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,000
It's really, really, really unreliable and that's compared to Windows

1093
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,200
which is already unreliable.

1094
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,800
So you know, to say that Linux is an unreliable platform is

1095
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,700
A lot considering a Windows is very unreliable to begin with.

1096
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,400
So it's really, really unfortunate and I wish that would get better,

1097
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
but it just has not traditionally gotten any better.

1098
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,800
And so the reality is that if you want to ship again unless you have

1099
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,100
to be really dedicated to it, the witness team does not have anybody

1100
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,300
who's particularly you know we don't even have anyone on that team of

1101
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:24,500
runs relax regularly and you know what's in it for them.

1102
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,000
They won't make any money off of it.

1103
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,000
You know, it's the number of game sales.

1104
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,700
We've got Olympics is fractures that they literally just be doing out

1105
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,500
of the goodness of their heart, which they made.

1106
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,400
All right, you know, they may do it just to be nice but you have to

1107
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,900
understand from because, from a business perspective, it's just

1108
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,600
straight up throwing money into a fire, pretty much.

1109
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,800
And so, I think, usually you have to do it for for a moral reason.

1110
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,200
Like, you know, I might try to have the Molly game strip on the next

1111
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,400
strictly because I want to support the platform.

1112
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,100
It's not going to make any money.

1113
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,700
It's gonna lose me money, probably or whatever.

1114
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:57,900
Right.

1115
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:02,700
But you know, that would be the reason to do it because it's

1116
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,500
financially.

1117
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,300
It makes sense.

1118
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,000
As far as I can tell.

1119
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,300
Elvin.

1120
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,600
Have you ever tried building something for mobile and submitting it to

1121
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,000
a store?

1122
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,400
Like Apple Store, it's way.

1123
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,500
The tedious process takes 30 minutes to build and only when it

1124
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,900
finishes, it tells you there was any errors.

1125
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,100
It's quite a nightmare for me.

1126
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,700
I don't understand why there are so many mobile game rulers.

1127
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,900
Yeah, I mean I think it's just the Gold Rush mentality.

1128
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,500
Like everyone thinks they're going to make get rich off it.

1129
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,600
Or something is why they do it.

1130
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,900
I don't know because, yeah, I agree.

1131
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:26,900
It's a nightmare.

1132
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,600
And then plus Apple just denies your game for random reasons like, you

1133
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,000
know, they just denied Binding of Isaac, right?

1134
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,000
It's like, you're just like, okay, like, you know, you it's not even a

1135
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,500
free.

1136
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,900
And fair Marketplace it's completely.

1137
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:42,700
It's this.

1138
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:45,800
It's this completely sort of feudal environment.

1139
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,100
And yeah, I don't like it.

1140
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,400
I wish we didn't have those things, I don't think they're good.

1141
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,500
Boondoggle, if doctors could grow, you clone arms on the back of a

1142
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,000
host animal, say a pig, would you accept them as transplants under

1143
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,900
body to get another 30 years of pain free programming?

1144
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,400
Sure.

1145
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,400
Yeah.

1146
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,400
I mean I don't know how they're going to graph them on there because

1147
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,600
that's really tough, but if somehow they would make it work, I don't

1148
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,000
know that I believe they could make it work, but if somehow I actually

1149
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,200
knew that it would work sure.

1150
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,300
Rogers freak.

1151
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,700
Would it be possible to make a front-end wrapping the next gen

1152
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:24,800
Graphics apis that you like that is exactly what we have at Molly.

1153
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,800
Now actually I kind of took matters into my own hands there and said

1154
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,000
we're going to have a good graphics API and then I'm going to have a

1155
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,100
thing that that shunts to these various things.

1156
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,300
Sean McGrath with my platform game Loop is more ready?

1157
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,600
Would you be interested in scrutinizing?

1158
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,400
The API design?

1159
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,900
I mean look before it's too late to change.

1160
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,500
It went something I think is an awful maybe although it's just it's a

1161
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,500
lot of work and I don't have any spring spare brain power for that

1162
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,100
stuff these days.

1163
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:56,100
I just like I work all the time and I really don't want any other

1164
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:56,700
projects.

1165
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,400
So probably the answer is no because the amount of time it would take

1166
00:59:59,400 --> 00:59:59,900
me to

1167
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,900
Actually think through how you decide to do everything and whether or

1168
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,600
not I think it was a good idea is like a whole project for me and I

1169
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
just I don't I can't take any more projects.

1170
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:14,600
I just can't between handmade con handmade hero and our projects that

1171
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,100
Molly which involve also like doing the website for Molly and

1172
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:18,800
everything.

1173
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,400
You know, I did a bunch of artwork stuff for Molly like there's just I

1174
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,500
can't so pretty much anything that's not a Molly project, just gets a

1175
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,100
no and that's nothing personal.

1176
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,800
I would love to help with your project, I want it to be good.

1177
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,100
Good.

1178
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,500
And like I was saying the other day.

1179
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:34,800
I really like your game sort of the direction you kind of want to go

1180
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:35,800
sounded really interesting.

1181
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,200
But I just I can't take any projects so if it's not a my product, I

1182
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
just it's an automatic no for me at this point.

1183
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,500
Especially now that I don't know how my hands will be.

1184
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,700
So for, are there any wrappers around opengl d3d, Vulcan that you

1185
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,900
would prefer to become a full 3d API rather than just a rapper?

1186
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:55,400
I guess.

1187
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,600
Yeah hours but I don't know that we'll ever be able to convince any

1188
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,000
isvs of that maybe someday.

1189
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,800
I mean I HD is rather symbolic but BTW do know what happened with the

1190
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,700
witness sound a bunch of people.

1191
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,300
I know had issues including myself and had disabled surround sound or

1192
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:09,700
something.

1193
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,500
No, unfortunately, to be honest I don't know anything about how the

1194
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,300
witness output sound at all.

1195
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:18,900
I have no idea.

1196
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,700
So I literally have zero insight into what people may have experienced

1197
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,400
for sound bugs.

1198
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:31,400
So, sorry, I can't really help you.

1199
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,300
Yeah, I don't know.

1200
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,700
Windows definitely is kind of a crazy platform for shipping stuff, you

1201
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,600
know, compared to say console at the PS4 sign that where you do have

1202
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,400
to, you know, if you don't, if you're not careful, you'll do something

1203
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:46,700
wrong.

1204
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,800
And then some certain motherboard somewhere, sound ship won't work

1205
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,700
with your sound.

1206
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,000
For some reason, you don't know why.

1207
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,800
And then you find out later, oh, you called this wrong function, that

1208
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,600
put Windows in this thing that the driver was expecting it.

1209
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,600
You know, it's, it's very touchy and so it doesn't necessarily mean

1210
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,100
that they did anything wrong, right?

1211
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,000
It doesn't necessarily mean that they screwed up it gets.

1212
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,300
Sometimes there's just like, oh yeah.

1213
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,400
These weird problems on various windows installs and you just have to

1214
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,000
then go find that out and fix it, right?

1215
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Let's see.

1216
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:20,700
I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and say that we're about out of

1217
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,500
time here.

1218
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,300
So I'm just going to see if there's any last questions.

1219
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,400
Power C 9k have you completed the witness?

1220
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,600
No so the last time I played through the witness was actually a fair

1221
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:40,500
bit ago and not all of the puzzles that are in all of the things you

1222
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,700
could do in the witness that exists in the shipping version.

1223
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:48,500
We're not even actually implemented at the time that I played through

1224
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:48,800
it.

1225
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:54,000
So you know, there's a bunch of puzzles that weren't even in the game

1226
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,700
and a bunch of puzzles that weren't working yet.

1227
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,000
In the game, The Last time I played through it.

1228
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,800
So no, I have not finished the witness at

1229
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,300
Point.

1230
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,600
I might go back and actually play it, the final version so that I can

1231
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,500
actually like a hundred percent it because I've never actually been

1232
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,300
able to play the game with everything in it.

1233
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,900
I've never done that.

1234
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,600
Middle of something I find kind of interesting regarding the financial

1235
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,400
viability of Linux is that in those Humble Bundle payment, pie charts

1236
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,200
the Linux segment tends to be way above 1%.

1237
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,900
So yeah.

1238
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,400
Like a couple things to note about that, let's say, you have like a

1239
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,200
phenomenally successful game, right?

1240
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,000
Like it's like super super, super super successful.

1241
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,500
So you met crazy money more money than, you know, you're like I would

1242
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,900
ever expect to make on a game.

1243
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:46,700
Right?

1244
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:53,700
So let's say you make, let's say, you make 10 million on it, right?

1245
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,000
So if you make 10 million dollars on it, and you got 1% of that back,

1246
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
it's 100 grand.

1247
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:03,300
so, for 100 grand,

1248
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:09,800
you have to remember a person who barely knows like, and I'm not even

1249
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,100
making this up, who's barely able to program JavaScript?

1250
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,300
And pretty well.

1251
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,600
Like it was a bit barely functional web programmer, right?

1252
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,100
In John's neck of the woods.

1253
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,300
So in San Francisco will make 140 Grand a year.

1254
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,400
So, the entirety of all the sales, you would get on Linux.

1255
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,300
If you had a phenomenally successful game and one percent of your

1256
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,200
sales, came from Linux, right?

1257
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:41,200
Wouldn't even be enough for one person to work on it for say six

1258
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,000
months plus overhead.

1259
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,100
Right.

1260
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:48,600
So if you happen to live in some place where the cost of living is

1261
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,400
extremely small which you may be looking at to do like maybe you live.

1262
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:52,800
I don't know.

1263
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,400
Like I was talking to people from Argentina.

1264
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,000
Recently their burn rates are incredibly low compared to what we pay

1265
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,400
in the United States for people's salaries working is right.

1266
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,900
You know there's plenty of places in the world even if you were in the

1267
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,300
u.s.

1268
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:04,800
if you were in Detroit Michigan.

1269
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,600
A versus Seattle Washington, your cost of living is, is dramatically

1270
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:11,800
different, right?

1271
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,600
And so one of the problems is the witness is made in a very expensive

1272
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,200
part of the world and the salaries that you have to pay people in that

1273
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,100
part of the world are very high, which means that even at 1%,

1274
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,600
It's kind of a loss, right?

1275
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,000
Because now there's also mental energy.

1276
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,400
John has to maintain that build.

1277
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,900
He has to put it up on the stores.

1278
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,700
He has to, like, filled all the tech support, right?

1279
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:32,700
So it's this huge.

1280
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,600
It's a huge mental, Jane monetarily.

1281
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,500
It's kind of a wash.

1282
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,500
Maybe you make 20K, maybe you make 30k on it, thirty thousand dollars

1283
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,000
is.

1284
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,500
I mean, what are you gonna do with that?

1285
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,900
You're talking about a game that made 10 million dollars, even to get

1286
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,900
to this point, thirty thousand dollars out of 10 million?

1287
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,900
Are you gonna bother with a whole new build?

1288
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,600
All that porting work, all that effort, you could have.

1289
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,000
Put towards something else you're not gonna write.

1290
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,300
It just doesn't make sense.

1291
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,800
And so I don't think people really understand the economics of it plus

1292
01:05:59,800 --> 01:05:59,800
I

1293
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,700
No, Humble Bundle payment, pie charts are self-reported.

1294
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,400
So that's how many people say they want their thing to count towards

1295
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:05,700
Linux.

1296
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,200
It has nothing to do with how many people actually ran anything on,

1297
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,300
Linux, right.

1298
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,900
So we don't really know, but what we do know, is for people who

1299
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,800
actually purchase games at least for like, like the unity Unix numbers

1300
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,300
or the steam Unix numbers, which is something we actually do have they

1301
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,600
are, you know, one person less than one percent or whatever.

1302
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,100
Right.

1303
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,900
And so, you know that may be under account for a number of reasons,

1304
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,900
but just right now it looks very unlikely that you're going to get a

1305
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,100
lot of Revenue out of a Linux built.

1306
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,900
So you pretty much have to do it straight up out of the goodness of

1307
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:38,500
your heart.

1308
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,200
And the Mac is almost the same Max, not much better, it's not just

1309
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,800
Linux went people.

1310
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,300
The people who buy games seem to be Windows users, that's just what

1311
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:48,900
the truth.

1312
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,900
And until that shifts, it's very hard to justify the portion of their

1313
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,900
platforms monetarily.

1314
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:00,300
You can justify them in other ways and maybe you should meaning,

1315
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,400
maybe, maybe you should do them for other reasons.

1316
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,600
But in terms of the specific reason of it makes money, it's really

1317
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:08,900
not.

1318
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,100
It's not

1319
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,400
At the mental energy and it's just it's not worth it.

1320
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,600
If you if you're in a high priced area.

1321
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,200
Lower-priced areas the economic shift, you know, if your average

1322
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,200
programmer makes 10 grand a year, all of a sudden pretty hard to pass

1323
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,300
up, right?

1324
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,900
The licks Revenue may very well be worth it all of a sudden.

1325
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:32,400
So again, different locations, your company has different concerns

1326
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,700
The size that could you stream the witness do?

1327
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,600
You mean me playing it?

1328
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,800
I'm going to stream some development.

1329
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,100
So witness development things probably this week.

1330
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,700
One of the things we'll chat about will be the witness, but I don't

1331
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:44,900
know that.

1332
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,000
I'll be streaming any playing either.

1333
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,600
Because, what am I going to stream?

1334
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:49,700
You've seen it.

1335
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,600
Let's see here.

1336
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,200
Let's see.

1337
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,500
And finally long billion.

1338
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,200
Let's change the name.

1339
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,700
Call it steamos now is it viable?

1340
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:05,600
Well cos didn't seem to do very well.

1341
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,000
So, I don't know.

1342
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,600
But who knows, right?

1343
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,700
And like I said, all of these things can change.

1344
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,500
You know, let's say for whatever reason steamos has a great Christmas

1345
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,100
next year and everyone loves it for some reason, right?

1346
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,899
Then it becomes viable and then you ship and then you ship a Linux

1347
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:25,200
version.

1348
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:25,700
Everyone will

1349
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:26,399
Right.

1350
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:30,500
I mean the bottom line is all Linux really needs to do if they really

1351
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:34,500
want everyone to ship games on, Linux is either a make it way easier

1352
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,800
to support the game on Linux.

1353
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,600
So, fix all these platform issues.

1354
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,399
So it's very reliable and very stable.

1355
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,899
And you just, there's a very easy way to write the sound and to write

1356
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:46,300
the graphics such that it never fails.

1357
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,300
So there's no support cost, right?

1358
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,399
Or get get, you know, show that people buy games on it, show that

1359
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,700
there's a big bunch of money.

1360
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,000
Sitting there to be made.

1361
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,700
And if they did either of those two things or better yet both of

1362
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,899
It's just, it's a foregone conclusion.

1363
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:04,500
People go where the money is you don't need to convince them.

1364
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,399
Once there's a bunch of money there, right?

1365
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,399
And and similarly you it's not very hard to convince people if it's

1366
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:13,899
really easy it's like a yeah you know it takes zero effort, here you

1367
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:14,700
go, right?

1368
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:18,800
And to some degree like Unity helps a lot with that, right?

1369
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,200
Because Unity makes it pretty easy to ship a Linux version.

1370
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,500
It's still a little bit annoying, but the support, but at least, you

1371
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,899
know, that they are kind of doing work on your behalf to to make the

1372
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,399
Importing less problematic, you know.

1373
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,200
So so yeah.

1374
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:36,200
All right.

1375
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,700
I'm going to wrap that up so I can go eat dinner.

1376
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,200
Thank you everyone for joining me.

1377
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,800
And I will, like I said, I'll be streaming this week.

1378
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,600
I just don't think will be do programming this week, so if you like

1379
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,500
chatting, feel free to come back tomorrow.

1380
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,300
Same time.

1381
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,300
Same place.

1382
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,700
And yeah, and we'll go from there.

1383
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,500
Thanks everyone.

1384
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,900
And I will, I will see you guys on the internet.
