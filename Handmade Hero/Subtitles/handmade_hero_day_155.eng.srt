1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,100
Start recording.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,400
Okay, hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,500
The show where we code a complete game live on stream.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,300
No engines, no, libraries.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,000
It is just us.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,500
And looking at the complete process of game development right from the

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,300
little tiny list little pixels that make up our game screen to the AI

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,600
that controls the characters or anything in between, we show how to do

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,200
it and right now we're at a Crossroads in some sense just yesterday we

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,800
finished

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Our asset pack files and they're pretty darn cool.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,800
The stuff that we engineered for them.

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,700
I think is pretty darn neat.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,400
Considering we didn't take very long to make them in, they're awfully

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,300
powerful at this point.

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,200
So I'm kind of psyched about that and there's really two things we

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,800
could do.

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Like I said, yesterday, one thing that we can do now, actually?

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,300
I guess there's three things we could do.

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,500
Even the first thing we could do is go back over the asset pack file

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,300
stuff and just take a look if there's any features we want to add any

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,500
little things that we think we might want to do differently or you

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,900
know, we had

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Talk about some things like adding the ability to suppress assets from

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,099
other pack files.

26
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,300
So like if you wanted to you know, patch or do things like this, we

27
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,100
can go do that.

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,800
The other thing that we could do is we could move on to working on the

29
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,600
asset memory management.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,000
But, you know, there's always the third thing, which is like we've got

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
two days left in the week, Thursday and Friday.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,700
And so, the asset Mary memory management is going to be a pretty big

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,300
deal.

34
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,300
That's going to be a hard thing for us to do because it's the hardest

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,800
memory management.

36
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,700
It will have to do in the entire project.

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,300
It's a virtual memory system basically because we want to have a

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,600
system that will optimally.

39
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,700
Well, not optimally, that's probably provably impossible but that will

40
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,900
very efficiently manage a certain prescribed footprint for our asset

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,000
data and it will cycle through the art assets for the game through

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,800
that system, based on what the most Necessary Things Are For any given

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
scene in the game, right?

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,500
So it'll kind of be trying to think about what needs to be brought in

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,800
and what needs to be done.

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,500
And and that's going to be, I think, you know, I one of the more

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Tweaky things that we do on handmade hero where it's going to be kind

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
of a little bit finicky and so, you know, that might be a better thing

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,600
to start on Monday.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,400
And just do, you know, this week, we're going to start on that rather

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,500
than doing a Thursday, Friday thing and then jumping the weekend,

52
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,000
right?

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,200
So the other thing we could do third thing we could do.

54
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,500
Is something else.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,600
And so, what I'm going to do here again, I'll briefly mention if we do

56
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,800
coding today which we probably will do some coding today.

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,700
I don't have anything planned for the Blackboard that would take an

58
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,300
hour day.

59
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
155 is the day that we are on.

60
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,100
So if you pre-ordered the game on handmade, here it up org and want to

61
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,900
download the source code that goes with what we're doing today.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Download day 154 source code.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,100
That's the source code from yesterday and that's what I'll be starting

64
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,700
with today.

65
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,000
So what you want to do is start out with that and you will be right

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,900
exactly where I

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,100
I am when I start now.

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,800
And what am I going to start doing?

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Well, I am going to go look.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,300
To do list to see if there's anything else that we might want to pick

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,500
out.

72
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,600
That's a two-day thing or something like this.

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,700
That we might, you know, that that might be something we should do

74
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,600
instead of, you know, instead of what we're doing before.

75
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,800
So, hey, guess what we did this?

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
So that's all gone, right?

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
We actually did did these as well, kind of, I mean, I think we really

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,000
just pretty much did all of this, so we kind of just have these left.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
There could go fix some audio bugs.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We have this sort of on the reload system.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,800
We wanted to flush the red cubes before we load.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
In the dll to avoid any crashes, that might happen.

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't actually know we haven't ever actually had one, so it might

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
not be a problem because it's not something that will have ever happen

85
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,500
in the shipping game.

86
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,600
So unless we're having trouble in development, we don't really need to

87
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,100
care.

88
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,500
And so the question is like, is there anything else you might want to

89
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:44,900
do?

90
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
You know, we've got, we haven't really done.

91
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
We haven't done fonts, I don't know if that's a two-day thing.

92
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Might be a little more into anything if I want to walk you through the

93
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,500
whole process.

94
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,100
And so I feel like debug code wants to wait for that.

95
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,700
So in our architecture exploration we got metagame savegame stuff,

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,900
these are

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Things that we will start on, I think in kind of going with the with

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,500
the game itself.

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
So I don't know.

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,100
I don't know.

101
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Let's think about this for a second.

102
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,899
Let's think about this for a second.

103
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,800
so, I guess what I would say is,

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Yeah, I guess what I would say about these is, you know, we could just

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,600
do something fun for two days, just for no apparent reason, you know.

106
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Uh-huh.

107
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,900
So maybe, you know, maybe we just do something kind of kind of, maybe

108
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
we can just pick something that's going to be, kind of fun, for two

109
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
days, something kind of weird.

110
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't see anything particularly obvious.

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,600
But, you know, the one that kind of jumps out at me, here would be,

112
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
you know, what about this guy, right?

113
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Systems are pretty darn simple at the end of the day and that might be

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,800
a kind of interesting thing just to, because there is something you

115
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,900
notice, I've got it up here on the renderer.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,100
It might be interesting to have that in place because I think they

117
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,900
might slow down the renderer a lot.

118
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,400
And it might be interesting to see how much they slow it down and to

119
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,000
see if we want to put them into the renderer in a more specific way,

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,800
just so we can, you know, play around with that a little bit.

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
So maybe we'll do particle systems.

122
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,700
I don't know.

123
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
That seems like kind of a fun thing.

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,000
I know what you guys think.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
Particle systems.

126
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,000
Maybe we'll try that.

127
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,600
Let's just play with that for two days and then we'll start on the

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,900
asset memory management stuff tomorrow.

129
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,600
So let's take a look here at what you know what I would do for

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
particle systems.

131
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,600
Okay, I'll do a brief kind of diagram on the Blackboard, will get me

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
steef up and running here.

133
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,800
Blackboard at Art and I don't know, it's just kind of loading, I

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,200
think.

135
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,300
Come on, Miss Chief, you can do it, you can do it.

136
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,600
I know we're asking it to do a lot.

137
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,500
Are handmade hero.

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Blackboard is so massive.

139
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Now, it just kind of goes and goes and goes and goes at infinitum.

140
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,200
That's why.

141
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,700
Usually you leave it running.

142
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,600
But of course, I had to reboot the machine recently, to do the the

143
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Microsoft Windows update to fix that.

144
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,400
Lovely thing they have where you people can root your machine.

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
All right, so let's talk about particle systems briefly.

146
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:29,900
Just

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,100
So you can have a little bit of perspective on what these things are.

148
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,400
So particle systems.

149
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,400
And, you know, if you think about how game Graphics Works in general,

150
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,800
we've got sort of a few different buckets that we put things into

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,500
depending on what it is that we are trying to draw, okay?

152
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,400
And so, in a 2-D game, for example, you've kind of already seen

153
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,800
actually two of these buckets that

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
Have implemented already in the course of building.

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
The handmade hero engine is things that I know that we will want.

156
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,000
And so we built them in.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
I showed how to do them in that and that sort of thing.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,200
And remember what they were is ground tiles, right?

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,100
Are the things and and Sprites, right?

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
And so if you remember, we did these in kind of different ways.

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,500
They both flow through the same renderer.

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,300
But like when we did the ground tiles, right?

163
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,700
What we did is we broke the world up until like these tiles, right?

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,300
And we made sure that they would, you know, be seamless.

165
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
So then we drew things in them, you

166
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,500
It would work or whatever and things would be continuous across the

167
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:32,900
lines.

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,200
But we fundamentally thought of them as like a grid where we would

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,500
paint into the grid and as things came on the screen we would, you

170
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,000
know, draw the new tile to put it on the screen and so on.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,200
And we had to think of it about it that way as opposed to about a

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
bunch of Sprites.

173
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Because fundamentally speaking, the actual graphic that we were trying

174
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,300
to represent, he's a whole world worth of non-repeating texture,

175
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,500
right?

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,700
It's this gigantic infinitely.

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Retching thing that represents the ground and I didn't want it to

178
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,600
repeat.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,700
I didn't want to be some cheesy tiled grass thing or whatever, right?

180
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
I wanted to be unique everywhere.

181
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,800
And I wanted to be able to us to do any kind of special effects you

182
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,100
wanted in there, like drawing and Footprints are drawing in.

183
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,700
You know like a river or anything like that.

184
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And so fundamentally speaking what we basically made here was like a

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
giant virtual canvas and we draw into the giant virtual canvas and

186
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,700
only fill in the parts that you can see on the screen because

187
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
generating the whole thing would be completely impractical.

188
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,100
Oil.

189
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
So that was kind of one thing that we did in the other thing that we

190
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,299
did was Sprites which are just you know the standard things that we

191
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,000
make little characters up out of, you know, we'll take a head Sprite

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,200
and a body spray and a torso Sprite right there, rectangles that we

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,300
put little bit maps in that have an alpha Channel.

194
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,400
And that's, you know, what makes up our little guys, right?

195
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,800
So, you know, when we, when we run the game and we have our stuff in

196
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,500
here, right?

197
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,300
We've got kind of this little little dude, and he's made up of three

198
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,800
pieces.

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,500
And then we have some other stuff there and we'll test things and

200
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,700
we've got the ground textures and of course,

201
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,500
He's that sort of stuff and Sprites are very good tool, right?

202
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,300
To build up a 3D game, they can express a lot of things to the players

203
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,300
and they're a good way for us to take art assets that an artist can

204
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,400
paint and put them in, you know, bring them alive, right?

205
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,900
And so they're they're one of the oldest and most, you know, sort of

206
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,600
their real Workhorse of a 2-D game, right?

207
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
And sometimes even in 3D games, you'll see them.

208
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,800
But in 2D games they're like, they're the, the bread and butter,

209
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,200
right?

210
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,800
So we have those two things, but there's another thing, right?

211
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,100
That kind of happens, which is that sometimes we have things that

212
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,300
don't have a specific shape, right?

213
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Sometimes we have you know, and maybe the word we would use for these

214
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,500
are phenomenon, right?

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,000
Right, like things like liquids, right?

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was well, smelling smelling it literacy, ladies and gentlemen,

217
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:56,000
liquids, you know, gases, you know, missed right things like this, and

218
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,300
these sort of a more fist shapes are very

219
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,200
For cult to describe, in terms of the things that I'm talking about

220
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,100
because an artist can't really draw the shape of a free-flowing missed

221
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,900
like, a, you know, Miss that kind of swirls around on the ground or it

222
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,000
doesn't really make sense.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,100
It has to react to things and it's kind of this continuous shape that

224
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,400
deforms in weird ways and there are early pieces to it, right?

225
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,200
And we've got other things like, you know, smoke Trails, right?

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Are this sort of thing, explosions, you know, very common in the, you

227
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
know, shootie kinds of games.

228
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,300
You've got just a

229
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,700
whole bunch of things that these sort of natural sort of Amorphis

230
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,200
phenomenon and they are just not that amenable to doing to tackling

231
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,300
with either of the two things that we built so far.

232
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,900
So what you typically want to do these sorts of things is that's where

233
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
you use a particle system, right?

234
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,100
And a particle system.

235
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Particle system need to go back to grade school here.

236
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
Clearly to practice my handwriting.

237
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,400
A particle system is exactly what its name sort of suggests that it is

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
it is a series of little particles that are treated together to form a

239
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,500
system and the

240
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
System itself is supposed to represent one of these bigger phenomenon.

241
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,800
So for example, if we did want to make a trail of smoke or, you know,

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,500
a fire or whatever else, what we might do is create a particle system

243
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,700
to capture the sort of feel of a fire.

244
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,200
And that is how we would solve that problem in game development and

245
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,700
there's levels of complexity of these particle systems and a lot of

246
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,600
other things we could talk about.

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll mention some of them briefly, but I'll simply say, the basic idea

248
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,800
behind it.

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
So, what you typically see?

250
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,900
See in a particle system on the effects house side of particle system.

251
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,800
So this is the kind of effects.

252
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,400
You might see in a Hollywood movie, kind of pearl girl system and also

253
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,200
in a game that's being kind of authored, in some sense typically what

254
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
you have in a particle system is you have a thing called an

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,300
Her.

256
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,000
Right.

257
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,000
And as its name implies it is some kind of a shape on the screen whose

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,700
job it is to emit particles, right?

259
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,700
So, you know, let's say we're making a fire.

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,100
So we've got, you know, some log, a log Sprites or something on the

261
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
ground.

262
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,500
And we want there to be a fire that comes up from those log Sprites.

263
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,800
So we place a emitter for our fire particles onto this place on the on

264
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
the logs, right?

265
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,100
And that emitter typically has some things like parameters like you

266
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,200
know,

267
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:31,700
Shape.

268
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,800
It is, you know, where do the particles start?

269
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,500
It has a bunch of parameters, for how the particles behave, right?

270
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,000
But the basic idea is that it's going to take this shape, and it's

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,300
going to put little points, right?

272
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,700
It's going to spawn little points at the location inside that shape,

273
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,200
right?

274
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
And, again, particle system.

275
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,200
Basically means these are particles their little points their little

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
points in space.

277
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,800
Right?

278
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,200
Then what's going to happen is, as these are spawned, they are going

279
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,900
to have some kind of simplistic.

280
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,900
Simulation to follow.

281
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,200
So, what they might do, for example is be told that they should kind

282
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,300
of have a random Direction within some upward-facing cone and they

283
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,900
will kind of flow out in that direction.

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,500
They will kind of come up and as they come up, maybe they'll wobble or

285
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,700
something like this, you know?

286
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,800
And as they get taller, they will go from being, you know, maybe down

287
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,500
here, when we want to render, them will do one thing.

288
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,300
And when they get up, cure, to run them to do something else, and that

289
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,600
kind of gets into the Second Step, which is we have these particles.

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
They're going to start down here, they're going to move.

291
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,600
Right.

292
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
They're going to, they're going to be simulated up.

293
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,000
New ones will spawn, and those will move.

294
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,900
And so you kind of end up with this kind of upward motion particle

295
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,000
kind of thing, right?

296
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,000
And then what you do is you have these points right in your particle

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
system and what you do is you end up on any given frame having a bunch

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,700
of locations where all the particles are right after you have updated

299
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
them after you have stimulated them forwards.

300
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
And at that point, what you will do to render them is, you'll

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,100
typically do something that involves putting down sir.

302
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,800
Out of a fuzzy blurry, kind of a shape down over the top of them that

303
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,100
may be like kind of dark in the middle but get kind of weak towards

304
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,700
the edges.

305
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,300
Right?

306
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,300
And the idea behind that is they kind of form, this kind of Blobby,

307
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,500
you know, kind of amorphous shape by sort of, you know, being dark in

308
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,000
the middle and and sort of amorphous at the edges.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,500
So you get kind of the Shifty sort of again like fire gaseous or

310
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,900
liquid kind of effect Happening by the fact that the way that you're

311
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,200
feeling it in kind.

312
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Blends the shapes together.

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,300
And there's no, like hard-edged outline of what the shapes actually

314
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,600
are, right?

315
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,900
So that is what a particle system is, right?

316
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,000
And it's pretty simple to think about, if you followed handmade hero

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,900
so far, it's actually not very difficult to think about what a

318
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,700
particle system might entail implementation wise.

319
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
Because when you think about it, really, all of these things are

320
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,400
fairly obvious how we Implement them there.

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Are there things that we've or you done in a lot of ways, right?

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
All we need is some

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,900
The particles like some way of tracking, what the particles are and we

324
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,400
just need to make up for I Loop or something that goes over each

325
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
particle every frame and simulates it forward and we've done the

326
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,900
equations of motion on handmade hero.

327
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,400
You know, a little bit about that.

328
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,700
There's really not much more to it for updated particles.

329
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
So really, the only thing that's a little wonky is how we would

330
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,500
actually render it.

331
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
And to start out we could certainly just shove it down the steam.

332
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Pipe line that we've been using by basically taking a Sprite, you

333
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,600
know, that is sort of a filled Blobby circle like that.

334
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,900
And just rendering one of those Sprites at the

335
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Ian that is indicated by the particle.

336
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,800
So what I want to do to kind of get you warmed up to particle systems.

337
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm looking at the clock here.

338
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,700
It's 5:25.

339
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,500
We started like about 15 minutes late.

340
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,800
We're only 10 minutes in the Stream.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,600
So we've got a good 50 minutes to go here.

342
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,100
Go go to about 6:15 to get our our in.

343
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,500
So in 50 minutes should be plenty of time for me to kind of get you a

344
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,200
little warmed up to the idea of these particle systems, just take a

345
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,500
look at what the code looks.

346
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Like at a very simplistic level and we won't try to make anything

347
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,800
fancy.

348
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,100
But we will try at the end of that 50 minutes to get to a place where

349
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,000
you can kind of see the protocol system operating.

350
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,200
So what I'm going to do again, and we say this very often on handmade

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,900
hero, I like to say it very, very often.

352
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,500
Don't overthink it.

353
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,200
You just want to make the simplest thing.

354
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,900
First, you write right now, you know, like especially out there.

355
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,700
You've never seen a particle system before.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,700
Don't go over thinking, it just go.

357
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,600
What is the bare?

358
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,500
Minimum thing?

359
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,100
I would need to do to get something on the screen.

360
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
That's what you focus on and then we build from there, right?

361
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,800
We always

362
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
Has built from there and you've seen me do it many times on stream.

363
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
We start with something simple.

364
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,100
We start with something, we understand.

365
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,600
And then it becomes very clear to us through the crafting of that how

366
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,000
it needs to start integrating up and becoming a more General component

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
of handmade Hero's engine as a whole, right?

368
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,400
And so don't overthink, it just go exactly what I just said in the

369
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,700
Stream.

370
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,400
That's exactly.

371
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,100
You know, on the Blackboard, that's exactly what I do.

372
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,500
Let's just do that in the simplest possible way first, and then, we

373
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,100
will start to generalize out from there and generalize out from there,

374
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,600
right?

375
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,500
So okay, so let's start just by saying, you know what?

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
I've got are sort of our came straight here, and I'm just going to

377
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
straight up say that I'm gonna want these particle systems, right?

378
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,400
So, I'm just going to want, I don't know a particle, right?

379
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,400
And I just want to track that list of part, right?

380
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,700
I said, I want a group of particles.

381
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,099
I'm just going to say flat out.

382
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,700
You know what?

383
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,200
We've just got some particles here.

384
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
How many particles do we have?

385
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,800
I have no idea.

386
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,700
Let's say, we have 64 a particles because that's how many I'm feeling

387
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,800
like doing again.

388
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,000
Just literally just the simplest possible thing.

389
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
To get things started.

390
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,800
And I will say that there is a next particle or something like this,

391
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,300
right?

392
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,200
All right?

393
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,100
And so in our particle we're going to need a couple things obviously.

394
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,200
Like I said, we need a position, we need a location where the particle

395
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,600
is.

396
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,700
We need maybe a velocity for the particle so that's how fast it should

397
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,400
be going.

398
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,600
And maybe I also want something like a color for the particle so that

399
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,200
we know what color we want the particle to be.

400
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
And, you know, I mean like I said, I don't want to get

401
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,800
it to overcomplicate it first, so that maybe

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,200
That will allow us to place some particles down and watch them do

403
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
something on the screen which is all we really want to do for today to

404
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
get warmed up.

405
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay?

406
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
So let's go ahead and do that.

407
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,900
Let's go in here to our our game update and render.

408
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,100
And again, this is kind of game update.

409
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,800
And render is the main Loop for the game.

410
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,200
It's kind of our home for misfit toys, right?

411
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,800
It's the place that everything lives right now, that hasn't matured to

412
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,600
the point where it breaks off into its own sort of like a

413
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
self-contained thing.

414
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,500
Right?

415
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,800
So we still have like our enemy code and stuff in here because we

416
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,100
haven't really gotten to that and that sort of stuff when we have our

417
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,000
ground chunk stuff in here because we haven't really decided how those

418
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
will be doing, you know, their final thing, we did all the composite

419
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,900
work and stuff like that, but we haven't actually gone and said, oh,

420
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,500
you know, how does the world, you know, it generation integrate with

421
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,600
this because until we have our sort of our game running and generating

422
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,100
world to the player to explore, we don't really know how we want to do

423
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,800
our ground chunks.

424
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
And so, what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to pick a place here.

425
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm just going to go down to the bottom where we have.

426
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
We appended like our test code.

427
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,200
And you can see right here is where our render updates are just right

428
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
before the render updates.

429
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm just going to go ahead and say particle System test, right?

430
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,800
That's all I'm going to do.

431
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,600
And so what I want to do here, oh you know what?

432
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,300
I forgot one of the thing and I guess I'll tell you.

433
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,100
Well, you know, I don't really have to do that yet.

434
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,600
I can just show you why we need it as it comes up.

435
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
So what I want to do here is I want to Loop through all the particles,

436
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:23,900
okay?

437
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,100
Just want to Loop through all the particles.

438
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start at the first particle.

439
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,800
I'm going to go to the end of the particle count.

440
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,000
Right, here's that array.

441
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,800
So I'm just going to say, I want to go till the end of that.

442
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,700
And then I want to go ahead and increment that particle index.

443
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,200
And so I'm just going to Loop through the particles again absolutely

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
nothing fancy here.

445
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm not thinking about speed, not thinking about any of the things

446
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,000
that we might think about.

447
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,600
Eventually, when we go to say, we want the process to be fast or

448
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,900
capable whatever, nope, singing very, very basic, keeping it very

449
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,300
simple.

450
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,500
So I'm going to Loop through the particles and on each particle.

451
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,700
What I would like to do.

452
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,100
First, I would like to simulate the particle, right?

453
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:07,100
So, I want to do stimulate the particle forward in time, right?

454
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,400
And then, I also want to render the protocol, and I have two choices.

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
One thing I can do is I can render the particle and then simulate it.

456
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,100
The other thing I do is simulate the particle and then render it,

457
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,800
right?

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And the consequences of the two of those is, if I simulate it after I

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
render, it means that the results will not be displayed to the next

460
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,600
frame.

461
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,300
And so it has some benefits when you do that, it means that when

462
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
particles are spawned, they are drawn.

463
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,000
At the location, they are spawned rather than being simulated right

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,500
away to a new one, but it has some downsides, which is that you won't

465
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,000
react to user motion that happened on that frame until the next frame,

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,500
right?

467
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
So I'm gonna do is I'm going to simulate first and then I'm going to

468
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
render second to avoid that problem.

469
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,300
And we'll deal with the fact that things move when they are spawned.

470
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
We'll deal with that baby in a different way or we'll try to address

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,900
that in some other way, right?

472
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,400
So now, I want to do regular protocol now rendering particles like I

473
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
said, doesn't really seem like something that will

474
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
be very difficult if we,

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,700
Want to do a simple test case.

476
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,200
What I can do is I can take this sort of drawbitmap call right, where

477
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,700
we call into the renderer.

478
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,800
And what I can do is I can just use our existing renderer to draw our

479
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,000
particles for us without really happy to do anything.

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Any other work, right?

481
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,700
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to again leverage that call

482
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,800
we can take a look at what that call does, right.

483
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,700
You can see draw a bitmap and all we want to do is pass our particle

484
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,400
bitmap.

485
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,900
So what I'd like to do is you know, make sort of

486
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,900
Of a test bitmap so we'll just call it test particle, right?

487
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,700
And we'll put that in the game safer now and then I need to pass it.

488
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,700
Whoops.

489
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,800
Sorry, that's the buffer.

490
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,300
My bad don't want to draw to the test particle.

491
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,900
I want to draw it to the actual render output.

492
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,000
So that's, that's a little bit of mistake there.

493
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sorry, cut and paste it from a bad location.

494
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,700
What I actually want to do is just run to our standard render group.

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
That's that that was all.

496
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
This is old code, this is old code.

497
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,700
What can I say?

498
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,300
Yeah, there's a reason it's all if zero doubt, we could probably get

499
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,800
rid of it, but we may want it again when we do the lighting test.

500
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
So my bad, sorry, you know, how it happened.

501
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,200
Of time.

502
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
So we want to push him out to our render grips.

503
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,700
A here, we're going to draw this thing.

504
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,100
We're going to draw a test particle and then we need to say like how

505
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,000
high that you know, how big we want that to skirt protocol to be.

506
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,700
I don't think we want to be very big.

507
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,100
These supposed to be like little small particles will tune that later.

508
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,900
So it doesn't really matter.

509
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
But, you know, just pick something, a tenth of a meter is what I

510
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,000
picked their 0.1.

511
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,400
All of our units are going to be in meters, I believe there.

512
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,700
So that's roughly what?

513
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,200
That should be.

514
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,900
Then we have the offset and the offset is just the, you know, offset

515
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
from the placement of this particle, which is

516
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,100
I don't think we really need to have it all, so I'm just going to say

517
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,800
you don't really need to offset it and then we're going to have the

518
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,200
color.

519
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,200
Right?

520
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,500
And so I don't actually remember although, you know that I think about

521
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,800
it.

522
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,600
The offset is actually the only thing that we use for positioning now.

523
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,800
So actually, I guess technically that positioning is possibly going to

524
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
be actually.

525
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,800
Yeah, that might actually be the full position because we probably

526
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,400
won't need to use the transform.

527
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,700
We wouldn't want to use the whole transform system for every

528
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,700
A particle and we'll see kind of why later.

529
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
So maybe that's that was the wrong thing to say there.

530
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,200
I think maybe the easiest thing to do would be let's actually pass

531
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,300
that position.

532
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,000
So we know that the particle itself does have a position.

533
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,400
So we'll go ahead and pass that position down.

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,500
And then we know that the particle, like I said, also has a color.

535
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
So we'll go ahead and pass the color to it as well.

536
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,300
And that is how we would render a particle, right?

537
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,900
And so, let's go ahead and we'll typo there, got to access that off

538
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,800
game State.

539
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,700
And so now we need to do is we need to find a way to make this test.

540
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,100
Oracle.

541
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,300
And if you remember correctly, we actually have a way of drawing a

542
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,800
sphere.

543
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,000
I believe we had some kind of a test for sphere thing that we were

544
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,400
using for our normal Maps.

545
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,600
I think makes fear makes here diffuse map, right?

546
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,800
And so what I'm interested to know is

547
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Our makes fear diffuse map thing.

548
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,700
In fact, we even already have one might be another question.

549
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,400
I think we do.

550
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,300
Okay, so there we go.

551
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,300
Oh, we do test diffuse.

552
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,400
Right right there.

553
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,000
So I don't know.

554
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Test a few Smite already kind of be what we want.

555
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,300
We should totally see because really, that would be that kind of a

556
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,700
Blobby shape that I was talking about.

557
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,900
So we'll see here.

558
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,400
We'll see if make a sphere, just diffuse map ends up, being something

559
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,900
that we want.

560
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,800
In that case, we don't even need a test particle, we can just use test

561
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
diffuse as

562
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Are bitmap and that should actually be fine.

563
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
I think we'll find out in a second, actually.

564
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,800
All right, so I think we can do that.

565
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,500
Although I also don't know.

566
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,400
Let's see, we need anything else here and I don't think we do.

567
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,700
So we can just go ahead and do it like that.

568
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,900
Push bitmap.

569
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,400
What do we need?

570
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,400
We need render Group, which we've got bitmap, then we've got a float

571
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:52,700
of each.

572
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Ooh, that's a V2, my bad.

573
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,300
We want our particles.

574
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,700
Presumably to be fully 3D, so that they can kind of go up in Z as well

575
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,000
since we do have Z Stacks.

576
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,100
So that's it for rendering the particles similar in the particles.

577
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,900
Forward in time, we've got a position for the particle, right?

578
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,900
And so this is going back to the equations of motion.

579
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,700
Again, you know, exactly the ones I'm talking about, which basically

580
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,100
we could do a very simplified version here because we don't have an

581
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,000
acceleration for the particle at the moment so we don't have to

582
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,900
account for celebration.

583
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,500
So all we have to do to simulate velocity is just say, well, whatever

584
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,400
the velocity of the particle was which are saying we're going to track

585
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,700
per particle, whatever, the velocity was.

586
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,100
We want to go ahead and take that velocity.

587
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,200
and,

588
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,500
And update it by and multiply it, by the time step.

589
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,300
So however long it was supposed to be between last frame in this Frame

590
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,600
it will it will move the particle by however much that was.

591
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,800
And we do have DT up here somewhere right there.

592
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Input dt4 frame right?

593
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,400
And so we can go ahead and just multiply out our particles and that is

594
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,500
pretty much the most basic the simplest particle update Loop.

595
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,600
Now, at this point, our particles aren't even like placed in the world

596
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,000
anywhere.

597
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,600
They would literally just be always rendering like at the origin you

598
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,200
know what I mean?

599
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,500
Which is kind of wonky.

600
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,600
So we'll want to take care of that as well, but that in and of itself,

601
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,500
right there is the basics of a particle of rendering Loop.

602
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Now, at this point we don't have any, you know, reason to, we don't

603
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,400
even omit the particles anywhere.

604
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
We don't even really start the particles up.

605
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,200
So all of their colors are going to be 0 0, 0 0.

606
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,500
So presumably, they won't draw right?

607
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,800
Although I guess I

608
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,500
Could go ahead and see what happens if I just force a color, just so

609
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,300
we can make sure that we're actually drawing something.

610
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,600
But, yeah, you know, since they have no Alpha, they won't draw.

611
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,100
Doesn't look like, I'm actually seeing any particles here though.

612
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
So, let me go ahead and step in here, just so we can make sure that

613
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,500
we're actually drawing things through our through our render group for

614
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:51,600
us.

615
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,400
And also since it's been a while since we've done this test diffuse, I

616
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,100
want to make sure that that that's actually valid as well.

617
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,900
So we have a bunch of things here that I would I would

618
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,400
To go ahead and validate first.

619
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
So I'm going to go ahead and break in there.

620
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,500
Let me go to handmade dot CPP and just take a look and make sure that

621
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
everything's kosher.

622
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,700
Although, you know, the other thing I do actually also want to do is I

623
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
need to make sure I set the render transform Stanley for these guys

624
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,000
because we never, you know, we set the render transform in here for

625
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,500
all of our enemies and stuff like that.

626
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,800
And that's not something that I actually ever did.

627
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,800
You know, if you can look in here, we set the, the global Alpha and we

628
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Set some other stuff here.

629
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
So we should probably make sure that we clean that stuff up first to

630
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,900
let me go ahead and do that before we step in just so I can know that

631
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,800
we've set everything up, you know, relatively sanely been a while

632
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,100
since we do anything with the renderer.

633
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,600
So you know, sometimes it's a little bit crazy.

634
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
All right, so I'm going to go in here and just make sure that it's and

635
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,600
make sure that we've sets kind of all the things that are render a

636
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,500
State might have just so we can make sure that we're at a clean

637
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,800
starting point before we start kind of playing around with it.

638
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,500
And also, let me see about setting that render group transform as

639
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,800
well, which of course requires me to page back into my brain.

640
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,100
How we ended up to architect AR for transforms?

641
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,100
I might also want to stop the incessant piano music.

642
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,200
We should probably have a kill switch for our music now that we

643
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,400
implemented audio, we neglected to actually Implement any way to

644
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,800
making it.

645
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,000
Stop, you know, which can be kind of tough.

646
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,700
So we've got the render transform their right.

647
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,500
And if we look at that render transform, we're going to want that

648
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,400
render transform to be controlled for the particle group.

649
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,000
And so I want to, I want to take a look at at the places where we set

650
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,300
the transfer get see there that offset P getting set to the ground at

651
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,700
some point.

652
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,300
I would like to make sure that we kind of clear that out for now

653
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,100
again, just so we're not looking at any kind of residual stuff from

654
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,300
our old from the code.

655
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,000
They rendered the entities.

656
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
All right.

657
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,900
So now what

658
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,300
Going to do is, I'm just going to step into that code and I want to

659
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,400
validate that we're doing things sanely there.

660
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,900
Let's take a look here.

661
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,700
So, there we go.

662
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,800
So each time through this Loop, I'm going to take a look at the

663
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,400
particles and I stretching all the values to be 0, right?

664
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,800
Which they all are, right.

665
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,200
Everything's all zeros here, all zeros here.

666
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,400
And then I'm going to take a look into the when we do a push it back

667
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,800
up here and I just want to make sure that test diffuse is actually

668
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
something that's validly.

669
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,900
Drawable, because I don't actually know that it is.

670
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,800
I guess, you know, the other thing that I could do

671
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,300
Do there.

672
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,700
You know it now that I think about it, maybe I'll just take that out

673
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,200
of the equation entirely for the moment because what I realize is

674
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,700
actually the other things I could do is I could just say I'm going to

675
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,100
draw a shadow, right?

676
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,600
Because we know that that works properly.

677
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,500
I don't have to go back and look at the test if you stuff, which was

678
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,000
kind of things.

679
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,300
We were only really doing for our lighting test, so there that should

680
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,400
definitely render something.

681
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
And so, if that doesn't, we've got kind of another up, positioning bug

682
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,200
that we have to that.

683
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,800
We have to go address, right?

684
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,300
So yeah, let's see.

685
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,700
Yeah, so it should I mean, that should be showing us something and

686
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,100
it's not.

687
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,700
So I feel like I've got some little bug in there that I want to take

688
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:08,900
care of.

689
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I can also make, oops, make sure that it's very large so that there's

690
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,700
no chance that it wouldn't be showing up, right?

691
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,500
So we should be seeing something showing up there, right?

692
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,600
So I think we've got, you know, problem with our render transferring.

693
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
So, I'm going to go ahead and step in there because we should be able

694
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,200
to draw something with that render group at that location and see like

695
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,800
a little kind of

696
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,400
Blobby thing show up if that makes any sense.

697
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,600
So, let's go ahead and take a look at what's happening with the push

698
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,400
bitmap call.

699
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Obviously, it's going to get the bitmap from the asset system, which

700
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,700
it does, and then it's going to go through here and try to put that

701
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,800
bitmap on to the renderer stack.

702
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,800
So, let's see what the size ends up.

703
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,200
Being for that guy, here's the size, that that gets computed after it

704
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,200
seems like totally reasonable and saying, then we go ahead and do some

705
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,800
alignment on that guy, which puts us in

706
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,100
See where that position even seems relatively sane.

707
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,000
This of course, is the part that I was a little bit confused about I

708
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,300
wasn't sure because it's been a long time since we did any rendering.

709
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,400
We've been in kind of asset land for a little bit.

710
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,000
And so it when we do our transform here, right?

711
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,300
What's the transform actually saying it's doing standard perspective

712
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,400
here, it looks like right.

713
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Our orthographic flag is set to zero, we've got the offset.

714
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,000
P, which is going to be nothing.

715
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,800
And I guess, I don't know for sure that the offset piece should in

716
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,700
fact, be nothing.

717
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,300
That's, I guess a good question.

718
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,900
Then we've also got the scale which is, which is regular, which is the

719
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,600
1.0 scale so that, you know, that looks pretty sane to me.

720
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:45,000
So I don't actually know why that is, you know, why that is being

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,900
grumpy with us.

722
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,000
Because it looks like that's a fairly same thing and I'll go ahead and

723
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,100
and double-check but looks like that's a fairly same thing to, you

724
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,200
know.

725
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,600
To want to inspect, right?

726
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,900
So, of course, we've got that nasty problem of Visual Studio where it

727
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,200
doesn't.

728
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Let us inspect anything when we step to the end of a function.

729
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
All right, Visual Studio.

730
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,600
How about if I jumped here, could be inspected, then would you?

731
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Let us see it.

732
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,600
Thank you.

733
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,000
So that seems assuming those are in pixels still, you know, that all

734
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,300
seems relatively sane to me.

735
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,100
I don't know about you guys but that seems fine to me.

736
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,400
Me.

737
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't know why that would be a problem, right?

738
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,600
That looks like it's on screen and well.

739
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,100
You know, I'll be honest.

740
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,700
No, I guess it really doesn't seem like it's on screen, mmm.

741
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,400
Because if that Center, does that centered about 00, let's take a look

742
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,600
at the drawing code for that.

743
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,800
Maybe, maybe I'm actually wrong about that because obviously we have a

744
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,700
1920 by 1080 screen so I would like to just verify that that's in a

745
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,600
same location.

746
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,800
I guess, the other way to do that would be to

747
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Sort of gang on to the hero if that makes sense.

748
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,900
So, for example, if I wanted to, I could just go ahead and make sure

749
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,500
that this guy was actually rendering all of the particles, right where

750
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,300
the hero is, you know.

751
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,300
So that would that would give me that extra level kind of assurance

752
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,500
there if you will let me take a look at that.

753
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,400
So there's the hero.

754
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,800
Okay, so I was wrong.

755
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,100
I guess we were just off screen.

756
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,400
000 was not on the screen because you can see at the bottom of the

757
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,800
hero now.

758
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Now there's like all these little there's that really dark black dot

759
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,500
and that's exactly, that's exactly what we wanted to see.

760
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,000
So, right The Next Step here for doing our particle system is we're

761
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
going to have to actually give these particles some color and give

762
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,800
these particles some actual life to them, right?

763
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,900
Because they're just sitting in one place right now, and that's like

764
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,300
completely useless, right?

765
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,400
So what we'd like to do is we would like to go ahead and actually

766
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,600
start using the particle color and we need some way of

767
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,500
In the actual particles, like getting the particles themselves to sort

768
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
of exist for that, lack of a better term.

769
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,199
And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to do something that spawned

770
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,600
some particles every frame, right?

771
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
So maybe what I'll do here is I'll just do like particle, spawn Index,

772
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,199
right?

773
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,300
And I'll do particle.

774
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,800
Spawn index is less than I don't know.

775
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
For this one for particles of frame, something like that.

776
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
And all I'm going to do here is I'm going to do is basically a round

777
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,500
robin scheme.

778
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,900
I'm just going to take this value, right?

779
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,100
Right?

780
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,900
The starts at zero and I'm going to say gamestate next particle,

781
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,600
right?

782
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,300
So I'm going to say that the particle that we're going to spawn is

783
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,800
just equal to whatever game State particles is, plus a get whatever

784
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,300
that next product goes and then I'm going to advance next particle,

785
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,900
right?

786
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,400
Then I'm going to say, if the next particle at that point went over

787
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
the size of the array.

788
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,100
So, if it's gotten to the end of that game State array,

789
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,700
Then I'm just going to go back to the beginning, right?

790
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,400
That's all I'm going to do.

791
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,500
That's that's it right?

792
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,900
I'm going to say go back to 20 and so all I'm doing is I'm stepping

793
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
through the park or a sporting protocols and when I get to the end I

794
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,800
go back to beginning an overwrite, it just like a circularbuffer.

795
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,400
I just keep over writing older particles with newer particles, right?

796
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,300
That's all it's going to do.

797
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,700
So, when I do this, I'm going to set the particle P, right?

798
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,200
Whatever that particle P.

799
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,400
I'm going to set that equal to, let's say just 000 again for now, just

800
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
back to the base.

801
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,400
But this time, I'm going to set that particle DP, right?

802
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,900
The the velocity of the particle, if you will, I'm going to set that

803
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,200
velocity of the particle to go upwards, right?

804
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,200
Just Z up words like so.

805
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,200
And of course I don't actually know if we really want to do that or

806
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,100
why upwards but I'm going to I'm just going to let that

807
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,800
Do its thing at the moment, right?

808
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
So let's go ahead and see here.

809
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,300
Oh and I forgot one more thing we need to set the color to something,

810
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,900
right?

811
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,900
So we'll set the color right now to just be.

812
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
Yeah, I guess we'll just

813
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,700
Make it Fulbright for the moment.

814
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,000
Okay.

815
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,300
So let's see.

816
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,400
We've got our guys, they don't see any moving upwards.

817
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,000
I wonder if we need to, like I said, I don't really remember where we

818
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
left it on, RZ stuff.

819
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,300
So, yeah, so there we go.

820
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,800
So now we just got these little guys, moving upwards, right?

821
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,600
And when they could only go so far because at some point, right?

822
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,500
The the circular buffer will come around and kill them.

823
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,800
I can spawn less particles per frame if I wanted to and then they

824
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,000
would get higher before being replaced, right?

825
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,600
You can see

826
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,300
And there's no kind of variability in the particles yet so they just

827
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,300
kind of Stack up there and just make like this very even cylinder,

828
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,900
right?

829
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
But even so we're starting to get the hang of it right.

830
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,900
We're starting to see that there are some little particles here.

831
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,600
What can we do next?

832
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,900
I'd like to do a little bit something, you know, to kind of get that a

833
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,100
little bit more like a particle system.

834
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,700
So one thing I'd like to do is I'd like to make our particles Fade Out

835
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
over time, right?

836
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
Like when they're spawned, I want them to be there and then when they

837
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,400
get to the end, I want them to kind of fade out, right?

838
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,200
We should also do for the love of God people.

839
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,200
Let us stop playing the music.

840
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,800
Okay.

841
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,500
No more music launch this time that was just a loading call my bad.

842
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Where is the?

843
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,900
Where is the call?

844
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
That actually plays this music?

845
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
We got the volume change who actually plays.

846
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:33,300
Oh, so you know we could do we could just make this music be something

847
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
that's going to end immediately, right?

848
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,300
Or we could make it be something that's that's that's not there or

849
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,200
something like that.

850
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,700
I don't know what can we do?

851
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,300
Because if we don't I guess we have to make a thing that just the

852
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,300
change volume, call can handle a null pointer.

853
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,600
That doesn't seem actually particularly bad, right?

854
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,300
So we could do that, we could just make it so that handmade audio.

855
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,100
If we just wanted to give ourselves the

856
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,500
To turn off that music which I really do.

857
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,800
We could just say that sound can be a know, you can pass a know and

858
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,100
it's fine right, it'll just deal with it.

859
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,800
Not really a big deal extra if in there is not going to kill anyone to

860
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,600
say the least.

861
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,400
So let's let's just get that music out of the way.

862
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,600
All right, so what I'd like to do now is I'd like to fade those out

863
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,200
over time and maybe this would be a good place to use our kind of code

864
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,200
editing or Live code editing, just so you can kind of see what happens

865
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,000
as I edit this stuff, right?

866
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,400
So you can kind of see the results as it goes right.

867
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,100
So let's maybe, let's maybe set up the screen, something like this.

868
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,700
We've kind of got the the just the Hero part over here.

869
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,200
And then I can I can use almost all of the screen at that point for

870
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
editing still, right?

871
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,600
And

872
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,700
Can just do it that way.

873
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,900
That seems that seems pretty reasonable.

874
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
So alright, let's go down there to our particle system.

875
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,600
What I'd like to do now is fade them out over time.

876
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,900
So when I spawn a particle, I give it a color here and basically what

877
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,000
I want to do is I want to say oh, you know, the particle P stuff.

878
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,800
Let's pretend that our

879
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,300
Dollars had a velocity as well, right?

880
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,900
So I want to do the same exact thing two colors as I did to my

881
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,500
velocity right to my position, right?

882
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,900
So each particle is going to have a d color value as well.

883
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:25,900
So that way, over time, I can set my particles to have some kind of a

884
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,400
negative effect on say their Alpha.

885
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,900
So their Alpha over

886
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,200
Second will fade out to nothing, right?

887
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Because I have a negative Alpha velocity on the color.

888
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,400
So again this is just like treating colors as if they were physical

889
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,600
quantities, that move through space just like positions, nothing fancy

890
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,100
going on here, red green, blue Alpha, right in this vector.

891
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,700
And so I'm just setting the the velocity to negative one on there.

892
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,200
Now I don't know if we clamp colors in the renderer, I don't know

893
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,900
that, I don't think we do.

894
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,600
So we may have to do clamping on that in the particle itself but for

895
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,800
now we should be fine for that.

896
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm going to go ahead and rebuild this guy here.

897
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,900
And let's go ahead and rerun that, right?

898
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Okay, so now you can any fact there you go, you can see exactly what s

899
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,700
with a non clamping, right.

900
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,400
That's probably something we should just do in the renderer because

901
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,800
it'd probably be pretty free for us to just clamp in the render.

902
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,500
So, I don't know.

903
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,900
But, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put it to do in there basically,

904
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,600
and say to do Casey.

905
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,900
Shouldn't we just plant colors in the renderer?

906
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,000
You know, and I don't know, maybe we shouldn't, I don't know.

907
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,100
We will think about that.

908
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,700
But anyway, what we can do here is, we can say, if particle color

909
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,200
Um, you know, is less than 0 x.

910
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,900
I guess we could do we even have a real?

911
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,000
We even have our handmade math.

912
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I think we even have a clamp, right?

913
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,500
So there's our clamp right there, clamp 01.

914
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,400
We can just go ahead and do that.

915
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,700
So we can basically say particle color is 0 or I guess you could say

916
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,000
color R equals clamp like so.

917
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,000
All right, so I'm just going to clamp the for and that's not

918
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,700
particularly efficient obviously, but that's, you know,

919
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,800
will kind of look at the efficiency concerns of this later.

920
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,900
So there we go.

921
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
And now we can see it working a little more properly.

922
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,300
Maybe that was a little too aggressive.

923
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,300
Maybe we want to be a little slower on the fade out and so, there you

924
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:19,500
go.

925
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,300
But now, you can kind of see that those particles spawn at the heroes

926
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,000
feet, right?

927
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,400
And they go up, you know, towards the ends towards his head and they

928
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,000
fade out into nothingness before they are ever replaced.

929
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
So you almost can't even tell that we're using a circular kind of

930
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,800
buffer for that.

931
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,500
The other thing that I might want to do is kind of puff these

932
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,400
particles up a bit because remember, the shadow is kind of weirdly

933
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,100
shaped in that way.

934
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,900
And so I is

935
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,200
I almost want to.

936
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
Yeah I'd like to get that.

937
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,700
Maybe it's a good time to use that test if you shape we can see if

938
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,800
that's actually useful.

939
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,900
I don't know if it is or not but we can we could try and and the very

940
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,900
least we could make one I guess so we could do game state test

941
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,500
diffuse.

942
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,300
Look so

943
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,500
That's got to be an address of probably, huh?

944
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,800
That's I don't see anything, so that's not good.

945
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
So maybe that's not the right thing for us.

946
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,100
We might have to make our own particle, so I'll leave it at Shadow for

947
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,500
now.

948
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,100
There we go, but maybe off to add some particle Sprites to the asset

949
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,600
Library.

950
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,600
So we'll leave it at Shadow for now and we'll just live with that for

951
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,600
a little bit while we do some sort of playing around here, right?

952
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,300
So, the other thing we can do is we can make, you know, we can make

953
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,600
this value above 1.

954
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,200
So it takes.

955
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,700
So the thing is darker for longer and doesn't start fading out till

956
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,700
like a further part down.

957
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,300
Although actually, I think about it.

958
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,900
It's, this is kind of slightly wrong.

959
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,100
Instead of clamping, the actual color value, what I should do is, make

960
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,700
a new color value, because that won't allow us to set color values

961
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:52,400
above 1 and track them because it will immediately clamp it down to

962
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,900
1.0.

963
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,400
So, yeah, I set it to 2 here.

964
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,400
But then it will immediately clamp it to one.

965
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,600
So what we really want to do is just clamp the output color, right?

966
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,400
And so what I'd rather do is introduce like a synthetic variable here.

967
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,100
That's only used for the render path.

968
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,300
We clamp that and pass that, right?

969
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300
And then we can do that sort of thickening and then you can kind of

970
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,500
see how that works there, right.

971
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,000
And of course, we'd have to, you know, we kind of have to fade it out.

972
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,300
I suppose a little bit quicker than that.

973
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,000
In order to not run out of rope there but there you can see now

974
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,300
there's like a while where it's full brightness and then

975
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
It starts fading out so we can actually do things that don't kind of

976
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,300
linearly fade our time.

977
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,000
They can have kind of like a delay until they start fading out even

978
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,300
with just the very simple to parameter scheme.

979
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,200
We've got a color in a d color, right?

980
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,500
So, that's that's the basic idea of particle system, right?

981
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,100
So now we just got to get some chaos in there.

982
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,700
We've got to get some motion in there because really, that's the

983
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,800
majority of the sort of the basic.

984
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,700
Your very basic, vanilla Workhorse particle system is already, what we

985
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,000
wrote.

986
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,400
There's not a whole lot more to it.

987
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,300
You can go kind of infinitely far with these things.

988
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,900
We like to do now is start to put some Randomness in there because

989
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,200
only once we get some Randomness, well, this actually start to be kind

990
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,700
of useful to us and you can sort of start to see how it takes shape

991
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:02,900
across.

992
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,600
We kind of also need a good particle Sprite.

993
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,500
But that's, you know, something.

994
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,600
We'll take a look at in a second.

995
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,200
All right, so how do we get some some Randomness in there?

996
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
We need to go back and sort of get our random or random stuff going

997
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:15,800
here.

998
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,100
I think we still have a series.

999
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
Do we have a series that gets initialized?

1000
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,300
I don't know if we actually have a series that we actually use for

1001
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:23,600
anything.

1002
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,300
In particular.

1003
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,800
Let's see here, random by letter or so we have we I don't even know.

1004
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,000
It doesn't look like we have just a running Series.

1005
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,200
So I'm going to introduce one because I'm going to want this, right?

1006
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,100
So I'm going to want a random series that just a source of

1007
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,200
entertainment.

1008
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,100
He that we can basically use that random series is going to be you

1009
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,700
know for effects.

1010
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,200
Right?

1011
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,600
Effects series.

1012
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,300
And the reason that I do that is because I want to separate things

1013
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,600
like particle systems out in terms of entropy because remember the

1014
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,200
random number generation for a particle system doesn't have to be

1015
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,100
particularly good.

1016
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,800
It can have all kinds of weird.

1017
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
In biases in it because it's not doing anything like generating, the

1018
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,900
actual game map or something where we wouldn't want you know, it to

1019
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,200
generate the same thing every time or do weird stuff like this, but

1020
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,300
the effects can be much more loose.

1021
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,200
So I'm going to break that out.

1022
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,700
Just so we always kind of know what's using, you know, entropy that we

1023
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,200
care about.

1024
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,100
And what's using entropy that we don't care about.

1025
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,400
In case, in the future, we want to do different random, number

1026
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,400
generators that are better or worse, for different things, right?

1027
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,800
Although I have a feeling that a permuted congruential generator is,

1028
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,700
Is going to be awesome either way but yeah, we don't know yet.

1029
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,100
So better to split it out.

1030
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,500
Now when we can keep track of it easily then not I would say, all

1031
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,400
right so when we go in initialize, the game state, right?

1032
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Oh there we even have General entropy entropy so I guess we did

1033
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,400
actually have one right there.

1034
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
So what I want to do is maybe put that up here and call this affects

1035
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,400
entropy.

1036
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,400
So there we go.

1037
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,500
So I don't actually know what general entropy was being used for.

1038
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,800
Let's Take a Look place.

1039
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:04,500
And so maybe General entropy really was that looks like that kind of

1040
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,500
was with that was.

1041
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,200
So maybe I even don't even need this but that's kind of not the best

1042
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,700
name.

1043
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,900
I guess I would just say affects entropy is a little clearer than

1044
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,400
that.

1045
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,800
I feel like that's and maybe I'll even put a note there.

1046
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:22,000
This is entropy that doesn't affect the gameplay, right?

1047
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,500
So that's what I'd like to do, okay?

1048
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,600
So effects entropy, that's our name for that now.

1049
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,500
Facts entropy let's go ahead and change the name of that anywhere that

1050
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,800
it was getting used.

1051
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,100
I don't like the fact that we've been squeezed into this little corner

1052
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,200
here, affects entropy.

1053
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,200
Here we go.

1054
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,700
So there we go.

1055
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,100
And this guy still working just fine over here.

1056
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,200
So let's go ahead and now actually start using that affects entropy,

1057
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:48,600
right?

1058
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,600
Because we can do random between we can use all of our calls that we

1059
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:52,900
were

1060
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:59,500
Using now to, you know, to actually sort of, create a, some chaos in

1061
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,400
our particle system, a little bit of interesting motion, if you will

1062
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,900
in that in that system.

1063
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,100
So, I'm going to go down to the particle system when we spawn it.

1064
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,900
And now, all I'm going to do just very very straightforward stuff,

1065
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,100
right?

1066
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,000
Nothing fancy.

1067
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:15,400
I'm just going to give it a little bit of x velocity by just I'm just

1068
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,200
pacing in a little you know that random between going to use the game

1069
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,900
State affects entropy, right?

1070
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,900
And I'm going to say that.

1071
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,400
I just want to do something between, you know, negative 1 and 1,

1072
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:26,800
right?

1073
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,700
Something like that, right?

1074
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,200
And so now you can kind of see already and I'll move that over a

1075
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,100
little bit so you can just keep watching it as I play with it.

1076
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,600
Right?

1077
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,200
You can kind of see already that just by giving the deal-making that

1078
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,300
velocity kind of spread out you're already starting to see something

1079
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,600
that kind of looks like a problem.

1080
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
It's not a good effect.

1081
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,800
We have not done a very good job with that but of course, like I said,

1082
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,900
we kind of need a better Sprite for it if were ever going to make

1083
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,100
something better with anyway.

1084
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,900
But you can sort of start to see already just with that very

1085
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Simple, you know nothing fancy just very simple.

1086
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,400
We've already kind of gotten to the point where you can see.

1087
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,100
Oh yeah, right.

1088
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,800
I get it particle system, that's that

1089
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Sense, right?

1090
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,300
And so maybe that's a little bit.

1091
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,000
That spread is a little bit wide.

1092
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,200
It doesn't really make a lot of sense.

1093
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
So let's let's maybe narrow that down a little bit, right.

1094
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,100
It's kind of like, pigpen.

1095
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
He's kind of like a stinky Hero at this point, right?

1096
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,100
It's what I'm reading out of that and maybe I want to do the same

1097
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,800
thing with the with the spawn, right?

1098
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,200
Maybe I want to make the spawn a little bit wider, you know, maybe not

1099
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,100
quite that wide.

1100
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,800
But you know, I want to I want to kind of Spawn some kind of magical

1101
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,700
effect off of his sort of ground layer there and you can kind of see

1102
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,800
that rising up like it does.

1103
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,800
And you know, you

1104
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,200
You usually want to put a lot of Randomness into these particle

1105
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,500
system.

1106
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:39,200
So we probably also want to randomize that sort of upward velocity,

1107
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,800
even though all the particles are going to go upwards and none of them

1108
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,400
go downwards.

1109
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,100
If we still, if we just, if we just change that sort of, you know, if

1110
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,700
we just give it a little more variability in how fast it rises, you

1111
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,200
can also see that it just it kind of adds more character to the

1112
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,900
effect.

1113
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,700
If we just give it a little more, it gives a little more depth.

1114
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,900
It gives

1115
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,800
A little more interest if you do that, right?

1116
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,300
And and it's also it's, you know, it's interesting to me, I guess we

1117
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,900
decided to just stop using the Z from these offsets.

1118
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,600
It's interesting to me that that just doesn't actually go up but you

1119
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,100
know, that's a, you know, renderers.

1120
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,300
They're always complicated anyway.

1121
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,900
So, you know, that's, that's the basic idea behind particle systems.

1122
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,700
Let's keep going with a little bit there.

1123
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,900
What we could also do is, you know, maybe maybe it's just a little too

1124
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,800
boring to be.

1125
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,500
Using this particular Sprite.

1126
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,900
So, the other thing that I guess we could do, we could say that we

1127
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,500
wanted.

1128
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You know, I don't know, heads, right?

1129
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,600
And we want to kind of just just spray a little heads out because I

1130
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,800
mean, who doesn't want to write and, you know, they've got an offset

1131
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,900
so you can see they're offset from the ground because they're not.

1132
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,700
There Sprite is, has that hot spot there.

1133
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:55,300
There's a torso spray right, a torso, sprays always pretty good.

1134
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,600
And you know what, how about a quick second for how awesome our render

1135
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:58,800
is.

1136
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,800
It's not even batting an eyelash.

1137
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,800
Josh, right?

1138
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,100
It's just like whatever you can spray as many torsos as you want at

1139
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:04,300
me.

1140
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,700
I don't care, right?

1141
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,300
So that's pretty cool.

1142
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,800
Anyway, put that guy back where he was?

1143
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
So yeah, so we can spray something else there.

1144
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,700
And the reason that I wanted to spray something else there, you know,

1145
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,500
whether it's heads or anything else is because another thing that we

1146
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,700
might want to do, right?

1147
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,300
Is we might want to give these guys some randomization in their color

1148
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,600
as well, right?

1149
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,500
Because again, the more entropy

1150
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,200
The that you can pack in there, the more interesting, the effects

1151
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,000
typically tend to become right?

1152
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,500
And so what I'll do here is I'll kind of kind of just give it a little

1153
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,800
bit of entropy there in the r g and B, right?

1154
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,000
And and so we'll do a random that will sort of give it just, you know,

1155
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,200
just a very little bit of kind of color variants in there.

1156
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,800
So you can kind of see, just what that looks like, right.

1157
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,500
And so, you know, you can you see how that's kind of doing it's you

1158
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,800
know, a little bit of a, you know, just giving a little

1159
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
Have of color to the the effect, right?

1160
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,000
So the other thing that we could do there is we can make the alpha be

1161
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,400
a little bit variants as well, and we can make the alpha lower in

1162
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,200
general to the other.

1163
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,000
I mean, the thing we could do is, you know, something like this,

1164
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,200
right?

1165
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,700
So now we're starting to get more of that kind of Cloudy effect going.

1166
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,600
You'll notice however, there's there's another problem that we're

1167
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,700
seeing, which is when we do something that's obvious like the head

1168
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,000
like that.

1169
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,500
You can see you can very obviously see the particles come into

1170
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:29,700
existence.

1171
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,300
Science.

1172
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,800
And that's something that will want to address two.

1173
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,300
I don't know.

1174
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,500
Yeah, I mean, it's 601.

1175
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,100
We've got 15 minutes left.

1176
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,800
Probably, I don't know.

1177
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,000
I started pretty latest are at least 10 minutes late today, so we

1178
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,300
could address that as well, but let me just keep talking a little bit

1179
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,100
more about this before we do that.

1180
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,100
So, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to, I'm going to try

1181
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,800
actually just beefing.

1182
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,300
Our particle count up a bit, so we can play with little bit more.

1183
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:59,300
Let's go ahead and go up to 256 particles about four times.

1184
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,900
The number of particles.

1185
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,800
That we were using before.

1186
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,700
So yeah, let's go ahead and just put that over there while we look at

1187
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,500
it, right?

1188
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,400
So there's our particles going and I'm going to go over here to our to

1189
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,500
our protocol spawn.

1190
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,200
And I'm going to say, alright, let's let's make them last a little

1191
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,100
longer again.

1192
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,700
Just get kind of a bigger if oops, that's the wrong direction.

1193
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,700
If you want them to last longer their case, let's make it last a

1194
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,000
little longer again there, you can get.

1195
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
There you go with that.

1196
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,200
And so, you can kind of see, and I can also spawn a little more

1197
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,600
densely, right.

1198
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,700
And you can sort of start to see, you know if you if you do lots of

1199
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,900
little things Blended together you can sort of start to see how it

1200
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,400
forms an amorphous Mass.

1201
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Obviously you don't want to do it with the head of a guy because

1202
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,300
that's not going to look like anything reasonable but you can sort of

1203
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,200
start to see what I'm talking about in terms of getting that sort of

1204
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,400
really odd Amorphis kind of shape stuff going on.

1205
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,500
And I feel like what I really need though is I need these to back off

1206
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,500
a bit on their opacity

1207
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:04,500
T, right?

1208
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,200
I need these to be kind of much lower opacity.

1209
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,200
Oh wait.

1210
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,000
That's the G color needs to be lower.

1211
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,800
Opacity there.

1212
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,300
So there we go.

1213
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,600
Let's make that even lower.

1214
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,800
There we go.

1215
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,200
And so yeah.

1216
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,600
So you can sort of see how it starts to do things that are kind of

1217
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,300
cloud like and again we're only just doing the most basic a particle

1218
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,400
system sir, because I just wanted to kind of get you warmed up, but

1219
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,600
you can see, you know, you can kind of see how this sort of thing

1220
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,300
starts to go.

1221
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,100
Now, the other thing you can do is you can give particles and

1222
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,800
acceleration as well, and of course, that's the, if you want to do

1223
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,200
things, that kind of art can do gravity, like things.

1224
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,800
And we can do all kinds of things, like feel defectors, and all that

1225
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,200
sort of stuff.

1226
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,800
But, you know, we'll look at those, maybe a little bit more down the

1227
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,000
line.

1228
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,800
That's more something that I'll put in the game code.

1229
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,400
I kind of wanted to get some particle systems in here so we can start

1230
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,000
talking about them.

1231
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,600
The thing that I was going to say is one thing that we do probably

1232
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,400
want to take a look at is the fact that this as a system where you

1233
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,500
just have D color.

1234
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,600
When X is not exactly what you want.

1235
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,600
D color is often not expressive enough for The Coloring variation.

1236
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,200
And usually, what you want to do with a particle system, is you want

1237
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,700
to have a very explicit way of kind of doing a color ramp through a

1238
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,000
series of colors so that you can start off at Alpha 0 ramp quickly

1239
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,300
into a full Alpha and then ramp back out again and so that you don't

1240
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,600
see that kind of popping down at the bottom, right?

1241
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,800
You want these particles to kind of fade into existence

1242
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,300
And so you need some way of making that work.

1243
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,100
And you know there's ways that we can pretty trivially sort of Hack

1244
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,400
That in, right?

1245
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,800
There's there's ways we can, there's ways we could Hack That in even

1246
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,800
with just we had now.

1247
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,500
And basically, what they would be, is, instead of treating that color

1248
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,200
value, that it Alpha value as a straight color value.

1249
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,400
We could just choose to put it on a curve, right?

1250
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,300
And we've talked about these curves a bunch of.

1251
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,500
I don't know if we've ever actually made a quick curve function.

1252
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,800
I don't think we have and so that might be something that I'll maybe

1253
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,900
this is what I'll start with tomorrow because I don't really want to

1254
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,400
start it today.

1255
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,100
I won't have time to fully explain the curb, the curve stuff.

1256
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:10,400
You.

1257
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,500
So yeah.

1258
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,700
Yeah.

1259
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,300
I mean to give you the an example this is not how I would normally do

1260
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,800
it but just to give you a quick example.

1261
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,900
Something that I don't have to explain the curve for, but that would

1262
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,000
allow you to kind of see what I mean by that would be if we were for

1263
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:35,700
example to make the alpha value, say something like if color dot a you

1264
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,700
know, is is

1265
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,900
Gosh, I don't know how I want to say this.

1266
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,400
So what we could do is say, all right, let's start the color values at

1267
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,400
at at at one point.

1268
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,400
Oh, right?

1269
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,400
And let's, you know, we'll go ahead and do whatever the necessary

1270
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,100
thing would be to.

1271
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:53,500
Oops.

1272
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,400
To make that happen and Fade Out at a reasonable rate, right?

1273
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,600
Yeah.

1274
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,600
That's just the weirdest are nothing.

1275
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,400
Yeah, okay.

1276
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,700
Well, you know, that's just sometimes you got a bunch of head spring

1277
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,200
out of you, that's just how it goes.

1278
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,800
So, you know, I've got something like this and, you know, maybe this

1279
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,800
is roughly, what I was trying to do with the effect, but I want to get

1280
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,800
rid of, you know, I want to, I want to make that ramp

1281
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And that bottom part, not note, so noticeable, like that, right?

1282
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,200
So you know again I'm going to show you how to do some more advanced

1283
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,300
stuff with that and maybe tomorrow.

1284
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,300
But for right now, we'll just say, okay.

1285
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:40,600
If the color Alpha you know is greater than nine point .9 F, right?

1286
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,700
What I'm going to do instead is I'm going to treat the range of 0.9 F

1287
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:50,600
to 0.1, F, I'm going to treat that range as actually ramping back out,

1288
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,100
right?

1289
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,800
So what I'm going to do is I say okay the color a, a

1290
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,600
Actually equals 1.0 - the color a at that point.

1291
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,800
So you know it.

1292
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:06,500
It'll it'll basically say you know, take that little range between 0

1293
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,800
.9 F + 1 point 0, f, which is point 1 where 1 F worth and I want

1294
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,400
subtract it out.

1295
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,700
So now I need to blow this color a, which is, you know, going to be

1296
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,900
0.92 20.1.

1297
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:17,700
You know, what?

1298
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,600
Why am I even saying this?

1299
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,500
We already covered this whole thing, we even made an entire thing for

1300
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,600
this, right?

1301
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,200
Clamp, 01 map to range was actually the function that does exactly

1302
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,600
this, right?

1303
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,900
It's a thing that takes a range.

1304
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Of values and produces the T value that goes from zero to one that

1305
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,600
fits the range.

1306
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,500
So we were to cover this on a previous Animated Hero.

1307
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,900
I don't have to say it again.

1308
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,400
It's your job to go back and re-watch it.

1309
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,800
All right, so I'm going to go ahead and and map that 0.92 1.0 range.

1310
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,300
I'm going to map that into make it.

1311
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,000
So it's the full range from 0 to 1, right?

1312
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,700
Like so

1313
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,600
And then what I'm going to do is say, well, okay, and I guess we could

1314
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,800
even do this range backwards.

1315
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,300
I think that that works just fine or should work just fine?

1316
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,700
Although well, it does a clamps or what?

1317
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,700
Yeah, it should work just fine, so I should be able do that.

1318
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,100
So it goes from 1.0 down to 0.9.

1319
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,700
So what I'm going to do there is I'm going to make that be the new

1320
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,600
metric for Alpha.

1321
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,500
And so what I want to do is say when it gets to its maximum height

1322
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,600
weight, just to 1.0 it's going to be at 0.9 and then that way, as it

1323
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,300
continues down, it should be

1324
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,700
Tenuous, right?

1325
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,300
And so there you can see what that does.

1326
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:30,300
Is it starts those guys out at very dim and ramps them in so that you

1327
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,300
don't see that noticeable popping, and it just kind of looks a little

1328
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,400
more sane in there, right?

1329
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,600
So that's just a really simple way to kind of keep that from

1330
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,100
happening.

1331
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:40,600
All right?

1332
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:46,100
So what I think I will do now that we have done our, our particle

1333
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,400
system, our basic products is I will see, I would like to do the Q&A.

1334
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,300
Someone was saying that if I just deleted my hex chat log,

1335
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:52,800
Ugh.

1336
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,200
That this would be, this would all work.

1337
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,900
So I will see if that is true because like I said, earlier, it was not

1338
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,300
actually working, which is unfortunate.

1339
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,900
So let's take a look.

1340
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,800
If that is actually true.

1341
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,700
Let's see.

1342
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,700
REM.

1343
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:20,600
And now I will try to delete bugs and yeah, so I will just delete

1344
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,400
those logs.

1345
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,300
I guess I will just in

1346
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,200
Do you know what I'll do?

1347
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,900
I'll just move the whole log directory to home.

1348
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,100
Here we go.

1349
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,900
Chat, log twitch old.

1350
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,600
There we go.

1351
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,800
And now I'll see if I can run my extract because if I could run my ex

1352
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,500
chat, that would be pretty great because then I could use the question

1353
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,100
prompter.

1354
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:47,000
Oh no, it seems to still be seems to still be crashy, but it still had

1355
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,700
the log.

1356
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,500
So how is it getting that log?

1357
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,700
I don't know, maybe I'll move the whole log store.

1358
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:59,800
Casey config hex chat logs to Casey.

1359
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Config X chat old logs.

1360
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Does that help you hand?

1361
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,800
Me text chat.

1362
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,400
It's still getting the old chat somehow.

1363
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,300
I do not understand how.

1364
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,700
Yeah, that's kind of weird LS.

1365
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Casey, config extra, yoy Oreo.

1366
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,900
It's maybe it's the scroll back.

1367
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,500
That's what it probably is, huh?

1368
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,600
It's probably the scroll back.

1369
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,600
So let's just do that.

1370
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,100
Let's just do r m- r on that.

1371
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,400
So I don't even want the scroll back.

1372
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,000
One more time.

1373
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:49,900
All.

1374
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,900
Yeah, all right.

1375
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,000
Let's see if the scroll back works, it does.

1376
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,100
Okay, thanks everyone.

1377
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,400
Who told me that, that was the problem.

1378
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,400
Now, that's good.

1379
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,500
We can actually do our Q&A with the standard, handmade hero.

1380
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,800
So, there we go.

1381
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,000
All right, everyone now is the time for questions and answers.

1382
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,800
If you have a question about particle systems that, you know, would

1383
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:19,300
like to ask please go ahead and put Q: in front of it, so that it will

1384
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,100
Up on my little question prompter.

1385
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,800
Which thankfully I was able to actually get working, thanks to people

1386
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,700
who said that it was the fact that X chat was was messed up.

1387
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,600
Jonathan Blow.

1388
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,900
In fact has joined us and he says for a while.

1389
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,400
I have felt that interpolating particles in RGB leads to results that

1390
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,100
are dull and muddy I have been wanting to try YC R CB and maybe even

1391
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,900
LED some time I guess you can compensate virus flying through RGB but

1392
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,800
I think you'd be doing a lot of Tweaky work all the time to get better

1393
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,300
results.

1394
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,000
Even though YC R CB is just a linear transformation.

1395
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,900
I think there's a substantial amount of skew.

1396
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:01,600
So what I would say is I actually have used HSV before even and

1397
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,500
You know, it's actually not that expensive to do HSV transforms,

1398
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,800
especially not if you're already on hardware and using a pixel Shader

1399
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,300
or, you know, in our case on SSE.

1400
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:17,800
It's actually not that many instructions to switch from HSV over and

1401
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,100
I've done HSV particles for and it is pretty darn cool.

1402
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,600
It's like really easy to make rainbow effects and stuff like that.

1403
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,300
So I have not tried why CRC be myself or any of the other XYZ color

1404
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,700
space.

1405
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:32,800
You know, I haven't tried any of those kinds of things, but

1406
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:37,300
I can say from experience that HSV particles are a good way to go.

1407
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know if handmade hero will need that but, you know, it might

1408
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,400
be fun to do an optimized, HSV transfer, you know, transform and so

1409
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,700
maybe we should just do it that way.

1410
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,300
Because yeah, I would agree.

1411
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,400
I don't really like RGB particles that much.

1412
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,500
Although, you know, they're certainly the most expedient kind and

1413
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,800
since particle systems are usually a speed thing, you know.

1414
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,900
X, that's a good thing.

1415
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,300
But but I would agree with that.

1416
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,300
Rohit in, not sure I missed it, but will particle pre-warming be

1417
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:12,900
supported.

1418
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:17,200
So I guess I don't really know what we'll be doing in terms of

1419
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:17,800
pre-warming.

1420
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,000
What the person is asking about is the fact that like particle systems

1421
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,300
take a while to evolve to their natural state, like for example,

1422
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:24,800
right?

1423
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,400
Right now you can see that this is what this particle sting.

1424
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Should normally look like, but when I start up the game fresh, right,

1425
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,300
it doesn't look like that.

1426
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,600
It takes a while for the heads to get, you know, to fill out and be in

1427
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,000
the state that they're supposed to be at.

1428
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:37,900
And so if you

1429
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,000
No, for an effect that doesn't matter because the effect is something

1430
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,600
that happens, and then the particle spew out, right?

1431
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,700
But for something that's kind of a continuously rolling affect the

1432
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,300
classic examples, like a waterfall.

1433
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,500
You don't want your game to be in a state where, like the first time

1434
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
you start seeing the waterfall, there's no water on it.

1435
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,200
And the particle start at the top coming down and then eventually it

1436
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:56,900
looks right.

1437
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,200
You don't want that.

1438
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,500
So how we would actually deal with that is a good question.

1439
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,200
It I would rather hold that off till we actually find out if we have

1440
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,500
that problem on handmade hero.

1441
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,100
But because there's

1442
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,400
A lot of different ways we could choose to address it and it probably

1443
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,600
going to depend on what kind of particle systems are having that

1444
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:17,200
particular problem, how we would choose to address it if it was a

1445
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:17,700
problem.

1446
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,200
When you were messing with Z Direction, it seems like kind of a puddle

1447
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:26,600
on the ground.

1448
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:26,800
Yeah.

1449
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,400
When you don't have any, why motion?

1450
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,700
It did seem a little puddle like

1451
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,700
ever messed with using some kind of stateless system for doing this

1452
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,500
like one function parameterize by another function.

1453
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,200
If that makes any sense.

1454
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,800
Yes, I have done that before.

1455
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,200
I don't love it.

1456
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,700
It's not my it's not really my favorite thing.

1457
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:54,300
I find that it limits the particles too much and a lot of the things

1458
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,600
that you want to do with particles that are cool, don't really lend

1459
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,200
themselves to that kind of parameterization with unless it's

1460
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,500
incredibly slow because it's just such a huge set of things that has

1461
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,000
to do.

1462
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,400
Is rain a particle system?

1463
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,900
Yeah, oftentimes rain would be implemented as a particle system.

1464
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,700
I wonder if head particles like this could be used in the game.

1465
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,700
For example, as an effect of magic related to disguises like when you

1466
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,100
dissolve, this guy's of the super, super fish?

1467
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:23,800
Ha ha ha.

1468
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
I think sure.

1469
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:26,900
I mean, who knows?

1470
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:27,500
Right.

1471
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,400
Never Say Never.

1472
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,000
Witnesses RGB and probably too late to change but we don't rely on a

1473
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,100
Wow, Wee, particles much.

1474
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,900
Yeah, I don't know that the witness would really need it.

1475
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,000
I mean, maybe there's a couple of places that could be cool.

1476
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,700
I don't know.

1477
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
I definitely wasn't walking around the witness going.

1478
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,100
Oh man, the particles in this game.

1479
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,000
Really need to be a chess vide.

1480
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,500
So I doubt that it's something that would really, it's not that it's

1481
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,200
not the kind of a game that has a lot of, as you describe them.

1482
01:05:59,400 --> 01:05:59,800
Wow, he

1483
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,300
Goals.

1484
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,900
But yeah, I mean there are some places where maybe it would be fun.

1485
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,500
I don't know.

1486
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,800
But yeah, like the HSV thing is only a limited degree of.

1487
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,300
I mean, you know, it's it's very specifically for doing rainbowy kinds

1488
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,200
of effects because if you're not moving through color or saturation

1489
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,900
space as a thing, then, you know, it doesn't help you at all.

1490
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,000
So it's like you have to actually have something in mind where you're

1491
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,600
going to want color variants like more than this kind of color

1492
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,500
variants, right?

1493
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,000
Z still points toward the screen I think?

1494
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,100
Yeah, I think you're right.

1495
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:38,200
I don't like, we kind of still, we are last pass on the render.

1496
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,800
That's still up there on The To Do List is got to be going through and

1497
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,000
getting the whole layer thing.

1498
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,700
Because we're still in weird, we're still in weird town with are going

1499
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:47,100
in and out where it looks correct.

1500
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,000
But we don't have any, we don't have the floor layers, stacked up,

1501
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,200
right?

1502
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:51,600
And stuff.

1503
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,300
And so we have to go in and kind of finally get all that stuff.

1504
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,400
Lay down, right?

1505
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,500
New khals.

1506
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:11,000
Does anyone ever use layers or just Z sorting layers?

1507
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,600
I'm not sure what you're mean by layers.

1508
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,200
What times does handmade hero stream?

1509
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,300
Saw this on the front page?

1510
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:25,300
And it seems interesting you can go to handmade hero dot-org actually.

1511
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,500
And if you go to handmade hero dot-org, first of all, there's a live

1512
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:29,700
button.

1513
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,400
You can always see it counts down to the next live stream.

1514
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,300
So you can always look at that.

1515
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,000
But then we also have a tweet bot.

1516
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,700
So if you go to the Tweet bot, it's always got the schedule.

1517
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,600
It's got your back.

1518
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,100
It tweets a schedule and it tweets the video from the from as soon as

1519
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,100
it's up for the previous show in case you missed it.

1520
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,400
So the tweetbot is your

1521
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:52,200
And if you're trying to catch the stream live or catch up with the

1522
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,000
stream, the tweetbot is definitely your friend.

1523
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,900
Jonathan Blow, maybe for the gala game.

1524
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,700
I will switch to HSV, dude.

1525
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:06,300
I don't want to hear about the gala game again until you add a bonus

1526
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:06,900
round.

1527
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,700
Okay, where is the bonus round?

1528
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,200
Everyone knows that Galaga is all about a fighter capture and be the

1529
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,200
bonus round.

1530
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,200
And you were like all about denying me the bonus round.

1531
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,600
I don't even know if I want to play this Gala game at this point,

1532
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:24,100
because if there's no bonus round of the Galaga game, why is it even a

1533
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,399
Galaga game at that point?

1534
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:26,899
It's like Space Invaders or something?

1535
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,600
I just tuned in will these videos help someone learn C and C++ has

1536
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
absolutely no experience.

1537
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:36,800
Sadly, not.

1538
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,500
That is some a project that I would really like to do at some point,

1539
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,899
but I had to start somewhere and so I decided that making a game for

1540
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:42,600
people who already had.

1541
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,500
Some prior experience was the best place to start.

1542
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:48,899
If you do go to handmade hero, if you go to hammy here at Oregon, you

1543
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:50,100
go to our video archive.

1544
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:55,100
There actually, was, if you go to playlists a test stream, I did down

1545
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,800
here called intro to see on Windows and you can go to there and you

1546
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,600
And look at a little just test course, I did to show people a little

1547
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,600
bit of how C programming works, but it's not enough, right?

1548
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,899
And so, you know, yeah, someday I would really like to expand on that

1549
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,700
and it's definitely a plan but, you know, I just don't have time to do

1550
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,399
that right now.

1551
01:09:17,399 --> 01:09:21,200
And so my goal is to make a companion to handmade hero in the future.

1552
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,700
That's like, here's how to, you know, if you know nothing about

1553
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:27,700
programming at all and you someday want to do the handmade Hero Of

1554
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,200
course.

1555
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,800
Here's the thing that you can

1556
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,700
that will take you from knowing nothing.

1557
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,000
Like, I don't even know how to program your turn on a computer or

1558
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,100
something all the way up to like, I can program in C, okay?

1559
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,000
Because this doesn't actually take that long but it is much more

1560
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,100
involved, certainly than five episodes of a one-hour show.

1561
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,000
So,

1562
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,000
Okay.

1563
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,100
Is that it for questions?

1564
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,500
Looks like it is.

1565
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,700
Everyone's good on particle systems.

1566
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:15,600
I take it, everyone's good on how to make heads kind of spew out of

1567
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,200
your belly.

1568
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,000
It's kind of looks like what that's happening there.

1569
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,700
I guess it is a little bit.

1570
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,000
Let's see.

1571
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,000
Have you or will you explain how shaders work eventually?

1572
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,700
Well, we wrote Our Own renderer.

1573
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,300
So we wrote shaders like we actually wrote the part of the code that

1574
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,000
is the Shader.

1575
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,500
So we already did that actually.

1576
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,600
But if you're just asking like how do I write an opengl Shader like

1577
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,600
the syntax of the language or something?

1578
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,400
No, we have not covered that and we probably will cover it lightly

1579
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,300
when we pour it.

1580
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,700
The thing, this thing to opengl or you know Vulcan or something way

1581
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:03,400
down the line.

1582
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:07,200
Well these particles be able to react to things like impacts.

1583
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:08,100
Yeah.

1584
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:13,100
I mean that's that's exactly, you know, the sort of thing that that's

1585
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:17,100
exactly the sort of reason why I said I don't like to make particles

1586
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,400
be functions, be closed form functions.

1587
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,300
Someone was asking about about doing that because I like to have the

1588
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:25,100
particles if they're all just there, you know.

1589
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,500
And and being simulated like regular physics, kinds of objects, you

1590
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,800
can choose to spend a little more CPU.

1591
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,800
It not much just a little more CPU to have them do stuff like react to

1592
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:36,700
Oceans or wind or stuff like that.

1593
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,400
That's variable through the game and not have to worry about how to

1594
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:43,700
constantly fit that into some crazy closed form way, right?

1595
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,300
How many particles as 286 particles at the moment?

1596
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,300
That's kind of spewing out there.

1597
01:11:58,900 --> 01:11:59,900
how many till we see and

1598
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Little slow down Edge well.

1599
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,200
So I don't know because we haven't there's a cup, there's different

1600
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:05,800
timing.

1601
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,500
Things here there's, there's a couple different things.

1602
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,000
This is not a very good way to process the rendering.

1603
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,400
First of all calling push bitmap for every particle is not really what

1604
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,000
you want.

1605
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,000
So, what we would probably do when we get to, you know, instead of

1606
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,300
playing around particles, when we're like, okay, we want to do a

1607
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,800
high-end, you know, particle thing.

1608
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,300
Here we would do more efficient throughput than this, but right now,

1609
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,800
I'm guessing that

1610
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,900
It's actually the scaling the it's actually the rendering of the heads

1611
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,500
that's going to take the most time in since that's the case it's going

1612
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:43,600
to mostly be about how big the particles are as well as how many of

1613
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:43,900
there are.

1614
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,800
You know, not just how many but how big so I suspect that I could slow

1615
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,500
this down.

1616
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,000
I could I could put a lot more strain on the renderer by making the

1617
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,400
heads much bigger right than they are, right.

1618
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,500
So you can kind of see that starting to slow down already right?

1619
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,600
Because now there's just a

1620
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
Kind of overdraw.

1621
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,700
It's happening to overdraw that like like really ridiculously much,

1622
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,600
right?

1623
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,500
And so you know again that's something that's like

1624
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,400
I don't know that we're going to try it.

1625
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,800
You re not going to kill ourselves to make to have tons of particles

1626
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,800
on the screen on the software.

1627
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,400
Renderer, I'm fine with with, with it being the case that

1628
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,100
That maybe we don't actually do our particle systems in the software

1629
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,700
under, we only do those on the hardware.

1630
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:33,700
But even that said, there is kind of a way that we can do particle

1631
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,200
systems pretty fast and software.

1632
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,600
And so we might just for fun, show, a little bit about that, because

1633
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,300
there's some interesting things we can do that would allow us to scale

1634
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,100
to very high particle rates in software.

1635
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,900
And, you know, maybe that's a fun thing for us to play around with

1636
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,100
just because you know, hey, it's an educational stream.

1637
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,600
It's not always about doing the most expedient sometimes about doing

1638
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,200
science.

1639
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:54,100
Cool.

1640
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:54,500
Right.

1641
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,900
Are using emacs outside of Visual Studio inside of it outside of

1642
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,600
Visual Studio.

1643
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,900
When do you plan on implementing a way to adjust the position of the

1644
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:15,500
individual particles, when the entities move?

1645
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,400
Well, you don't really have to do that, right?

1646
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,500
I just kind of stuck it in here because I didn't want to deal with it,

1647
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,900
but you can just put it outside, right?

1648
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:27,700
So, you know, a lot of that is just figuring out the the, the

1649
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,900
placement, you know, one of the problems with the particle systems is

1650
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,700
we have to figure out how we want them anchored, right?

1651
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,500
And so, you know,

1652
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm not sure what the what the right way to do that is, but we

1653
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,600
presumably want to Anchor them in the world and I don't know, maybe

1654
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,000
also have some that are kind of screen space e.

1655
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,300
So it's hard to say

1656
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,800
What do you what made you pick C++ over C sharp.

1657
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:09,200
Well C, sharp is, is not really a language for programming computers,

1658
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:09,500
right?

1659
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,100
C sharp is a language for programming.

1660
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:11,800
Other programs.

1661
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,100
It runs on top of a virtual machine, and it has, like, garbage

1662
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,700
collection and all of this other stuff.

1663
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,500
So, the point of this project is to show how to actually program a

1664
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,000
computer.

1665
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,400
So I wanted a language where you wrote code that is directly

1666
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,800
translated into assembly so that you could see, you know, that kind of

1667
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,100
direct correlation between

1668
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,600
What you're doing and and what the computer is doing as opposed to C

1669
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,700
sharp which is more about telling Microsoft's code, how to do what it

1670
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:38,900
is.

1671
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,800
You it's more about selling Microsoft's code.

1672
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:45,900
What you wanted it to tell the CPU to do, which is not at all, what

1673
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,100
we're trying to do on this stream,

1674
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,500
What parameters were you tweak with curves, scale, position, color

1675
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,600
rotation, external Force, etcetera, and will the curves depend on time

1676
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:01,800
only.

1677
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,600
Maybe this question is for tomorrow though.

1678
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,100
Well, I don't know, like I said, you know, particle systems tend to be

1679
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,300
very ad hoc you know, I mean unless you're sitting down to write like

1680
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:15,800
licensed engine particle system like you know if your if your epic or

1681
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,900
you know your Unity or somebody right and you have to ship a particle

1682
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,700
system, that's like this General particle system.

1683
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,800
This design to be used by like all the games ever or whatever.

1684
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,100
Gotta think through like, how you're going to support all these crazy

1685
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,400
diverse cases, and you can't support them all perfectly.

1686
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,700
So you do some kind of like thing that maybe works for some most of

1687
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,000
them and whatever, right?

1688
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:40,400
We'd only have that problem because we're hand writing our games.

1689
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,400
So we can just, as we come to things that we need, we can do whatever

1690
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,700
makes the most sense for that, right?

1691
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,700
So we don't really need to think about that.

1692
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,400
We can just go, okay.

1693
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,700
We, you know, I showed, you know, we took today and will probably take

1694
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:54,700
tomorrow to display the products.

1695
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:55,300
I'm so now everyone.

1696
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,100
What they are, will put them on a shelf for a while.

1697
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,200
And then when the game is up and running, and we're mostly doing game

1698
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,900
code, then we can just go, hey, you know, what would be nice to have

1699
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:07,500
some particle effects in here and then we can write the particle code

1700
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,200
for that particular circumstance as it as it arises, right?

1701
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,800
How many times have you said, right?

1702
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,300
In this Ruckus?

1703
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,400
I say write a lot.

1704
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,300
The other one I say or a lot is basically, so, I would not try to

1705
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,200
count those two.

1706
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,700
You're going to get to very high numbers.

1707
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,900
You're going to overflow your counter

1708
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:37,200
Vertical flow.

1709
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,700
Now, how about to show?

1710
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,400
How to fix horizontal?

1711
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:45,900
I don't know what that means.

1712
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,900
Nichols is your e max, if it open source, it's not open source but it

1713
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:55,600
is included.

1714
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,800
If you pre-order the game at comes with the source code.

1715
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,000
So it's in some sense.

1716
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,900
Can you explain what procedural level generation is?

1717
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:09,600
And are there other types of generation?

1718
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,900
And if so what is the difference?

1719
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:11,800
Well, procedural.

1720
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,800
Level generation is usually the phrase that's used to distinguish

1721
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,500
games.

1722
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:23,000
That generate their levels fresh every time using algorithms versus

1723
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,600
games, where there were level designers who made the levels by hand

1724
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,700
and positioned the things where they're going to be.

1725
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,100
So it's like procedural.

1726
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:34,800
Level generation is just the blanket term for this game has actual

1727
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,500
That runs when you start the game to figure out what the levels will

1728
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,000
look like so that they can be different every time instead of always

1729
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,100
having to be whatever a level designer sort of laid out if that makes

1730
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:44,500
sense.

1731
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,300
Gary Johansen off topic.

1732
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,300
What do you think about using Unity as a platform layer and using all

1733
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,600
your own logic?

1734
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,600
I've never really looked at doing something like that.

1735
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,900
So I don't have much of an opinion about it.

1736
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,100
Other than to say, you know, I don't like C sharp.

1737
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:16,500
I wouldn't ever program in C sharp and unity is kind of about enabling

1738
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,100
C sharp as the logic layer.

1739
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,100
So I feel like that would be kind of an automatic know for me.

1740
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,200
But you know, that's not an informed opinion.

1741
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:34,800
That's just my, you know, immediate thought I write my own engines

1742
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,300
from scratch.

1743
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:38,700
So obviously I don't ever need to ask that particular question.

1744
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,800
So I, you know, I'm never going to go look at Unity to see what I

1745
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,100
think about thing X because I you know, know a priori that I'm going

1746
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,500
to be happier with my own code, so I always use my own code.

1747
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,800
Why do you pronounce nightmare as night mirror?

1748
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I didn't know that I did.

1749
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,400
Do you have someone making the game assets for your they self-made.

1750
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:09,600
Yes.

1751
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,800
Yang Stanley is making the art assets and she is a very good painter

1752
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,200
and she makes the art assets for this game.

1753
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,300
Will you be making development tools for handmade hero like a map

1754
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:19,500
editor?

1755
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,600
No, because it is procedurally generated.

1756
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,300
So there is no map editor.

1757
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:26,400
It is the maps are created by the game and they're different every

1758
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:26,700
time.

1759
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,100
I mean is your config public domain?

1760
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,600
Can I give it to someone who'd like to get started with Emax?

1761
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,300
I myself pre-ordered ages ago, best, $15 finisher of my life.

1762
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,000
No contest for you.

1763
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,400
New clothes, of course you can

1764
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,600
You can use the allows I have done this much using rust, FYI.

1765
01:20:59,600 --> 01:20:59,700
So

1766
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,400
I'm saying I've just a patch it back to the original question.

1767
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:07,900
You're saying using Unity as a platform layer but but driving it with

1768
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,600
compiled dlls I guess what?

1769
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,600
I don't super understand there is how do you run the dlls on the other

1770
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,300
platforms.

1771
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,900
So like you can't load a dll from that you can pile on Windows on

1772
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:19,000
Android, right?

1773
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,800
So I guess I don't understand what you mean by platform layer.

1774
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,700
If you're saying dll because dll is Windows and sometimes Mac, but

1775
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,200
that's more or less it.

1776
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:29,800
And so

1777
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,100
So I'm not sure I understand what you're advocating at that point

1778
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,800
you're saying dlls linking dlls to Unity.

1779
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:37,900
Because what do you mean it's by platform layer at that point it's not

1780
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:41,800
really a platform layer unless you can run it on all the different

1781
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,600
Well platforms, right?

1782
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:56,800
Noodles.

1783
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,300
I don't know how to pronounce your name.

1784
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,400
I have no idea how to pronounce her name.

1785
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,100
I feel like if you want your name to be pronounced properly, you have

1786
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:08,800
to put a little pronunciation guide next because K KN e w.

1787
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,500
KL e.

1788
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,800
S is really hard to guess.

1789
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:16,000
I was saying k'nuckles before.

1790
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,000
Now, I'm saying new colls, but you're saying maybe it's

1791
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,900
snoo colls.

1792
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,400
I don't I don't know how to say it.

1793
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:25,300
I do not know.

1794
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,700
Hank 07, I mean the particular flow or direction is now from bottom

1795
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,200
up.

1796
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,500
Feels like it's not hard to do left to right, for example, you mean

1797
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,200
use, if you are you just talking about, I'm not sure what you're

1798
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,500
talking about.

1799
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:49,000
Still, are you talking about the fact that the particles go that way

1800
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:50,600
because yeah.

1801
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,100
Sure you can make the particles.

1802
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,900
Go anyway, you want because DP the direction, right?

1803
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,500
The velocity Vector can point in any direction you want.

1804
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:01,300
I mean here's the velocity vector.

1805
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,400
Written out explicitly, right?

1806
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,400
And if you wanted it to go in some other direction, you could totally

1807
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:08,900
do that trivially, right?

1808
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,500
You just say, oh, you know what?

1809
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:14,900
It's going to have a sideways motion to it as well, right?

1810
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:18,200
And now they spray off kind of in that direction or something, right?

1811
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,000
And you could, you could obviously say, oh, you know what, I want to

1812
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:26,100
cut, you know, I want to I want to keep it chaotic up and down and so

1813
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,000
it's kind of a spray out to the side, right?

1814
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,300
So yeah all that stuff is really pretty.

1815
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,600
Pretty straightforward because you just have a velocity vector.

1816
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,800
And so this velocity Vector is just the whatever Direction it points.

1817
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,100
Is the direction, the particle will go, you know,

1818
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,100
so hopefully that answers that

1819
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,600
Get new goals gun, new goals.

1820
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:03,800
K new coils.

1821
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:05,900
K Nichols.

1822
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:06,300
Okay?

1823
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,300
So K new coils is how you pronounce it.

1824
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,100
K knuckles.

1825
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:15,000
I like that other people are selecting like Chuck Norris.

1826
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:17,700
We could just call you Chuck Norris.

1827
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,100
K new coils.

1828
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:28,800
All right.

1829
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,700
Well, I think we have come to the end of handmade hero for today.

1830
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:38,800
We are now spraying heads around, and let's be honest.

1831
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,100
That is always something that I feel like we want to be able to do.

1832
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,700
Who doesn't want to be able to spray a bunch of heads around.

1833
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,900
I feel like I speak for everyone when I say that.

1834
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,500
That's something that everyone wants to do.

1835
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,100
So let's go ahead and close that up.

1836
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:58,300
And get our Dev Studio closed down.

1837
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:05,800
Save our, you know, our mischief and let us go back to the handmade

1838
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,800
here web page, okay?

1839
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,000
Everyone, thank you for joining me for another episode of handmade

1840
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,200
hero.

1841
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,400
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1842
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,600
As always, if you would like to follow along at home with the series,

1843
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,300
you can always pre-order the game on handmade hero dot org and it

1844
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,400
comes with a source code.

1845
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
