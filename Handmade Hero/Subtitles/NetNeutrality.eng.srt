00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello everybody and welcome to a special mini handmade hero.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,100
This is being recorded well and streamed here on July 12th which is

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,400
the day that I honestly don't know why it was specifically selected.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,000
But it was the day that was selected for the internet at large is sort

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,600
of protest against America's fcc's decision or you know, sort of

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,700
suggestion

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,400
That they would start repealing, or messing with net neutrality.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,800
Now, for those of you who don't know what net neutrality is, it's kind

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,900
of a difficult term because a lot of people try to make it mean

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,400
different things, but what the actual point of it is just that in the

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,200
future, what we would like to move towards because we have discovered

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,400
that the internet is a very important thing to basically, everyone's

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,300
lives at this point is eventually we'd like to see a future and I

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,700
think everyone probably would, where people

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,100
Have access to the internet and could use it as basically a utility,

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,700
right?

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,000
The same way that you think of electricity or water in a developed

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,800
country, you would think of, you know, having internet, right?

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
This is one of the things that is now one of the core services that

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,900
the government is expected to be able to provide or require to be

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,900
provided by private parties, in a way that's fair to everybody and

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,700
that serves the public interest as

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,100
As possible, right?

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,400
And so, in the u.s., there's obviously different models for these

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,600
sorts of things to different countries, some countries are more

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,400
socialist with the way they do their utilities.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Some companies, some countries are more privatized in the u.s.

28
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,000
we have kind of a mixture.

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:49,400
There are private companies who do you know, certain aspects of

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,300
providing utilities?

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,000
But they're typically regulated very strongly and one of the ways that

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,500
these sort of utilities can be regulated as something called common

33
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,700
carrier regulation and what common carrier means.

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,300
Ins in our legal system, is just that in general, you are not allowed

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,900
to discriminate based on the endpoints of what's going on.

36
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,800
So, for example, if you were a telephone provider and you have a call

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,000
from person a to person, b, or company a, to Company B or person a to

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,700
Company B, whatever it is, you're not allowed to give different levels

39
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,800
of service based on those endpoints, you have to treat what's

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,600
traveling basically a

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,700
Some kind of a constant, guaranteed service level based on whatever

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,800
these folks are paying for.

43
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,800
So if you pay for, you know, long distance service on a phone line,

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,600
back in the old days for internet, in this case, where you're paying

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,400
for a certain speed internet, then you have to get that speed, no

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,900
matter who you're talking to, they're not allowed to look at what

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
you're getting your.

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,200
You know?

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Look at who you're talking to and change.

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,600
What is

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You to your connection based on this.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
And that's what common carrier means.

53
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,700
A sort of means that these rules that are in place to guarantee that

54
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,700
you're just providing a substrate and you're not acting above that as

55
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,300
some kind of an overseer or big brother or whatever else is what the

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,900
FCC decided to allow internet companies to be regulated.

57
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:26,300
Under, I believe it was last year and before that in the u.s., we

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,400
actually had a lot of problems with this sort of thing.

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
There actually were

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,300
Instances of isps, big powerful isps, such as Comcast messing with

61
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,000
internet traffic.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,600
That was based on what you were doing.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,500
So for example, you might get a service that claims to be a certain

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,700
speed or claims to do something particular and you're paying for it.

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,600
But then when you actually go to use that service you find that.

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,200
If you go to use BitTorrent, for example, they would cap the band with

67
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
it something lower.

68
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,900
Or if you go to use Netflix, maybe they tried to charge.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,200
Flicks for that bandwidth because they would make it slower or reduce

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,600
the quality of streaming if Netflix refuse to pay, right?

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,900
All kinds of things like this that they were completely within their

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,700
rights to do because they were not regulated as a common carrier and

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:21,899
we're not under any legal requirement to provide Fair service, right?

74
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,800
And so thankfully finally and and I think that this is largely due to

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
the fact that there are a lot of very powerful.

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,300
Operations in the United States who want to see Fair internet traffic

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,200
rules primarily because that's how they exist, right?

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Google Facebook, Twitter, you know, these are companies Amazon eBay.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,800
They rely on a fair connection to their customers over the internet

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
and they don't want to see a world where they are going to be extorted

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,600
for example by Comcast or these other isps extorted in a way that

82
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
requires them to pay.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
In order to get access to their customers.

84
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,000
And furthermore you while there's very powerful, people who want to

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,300
see that neutrality in Forest.

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,300
You can also imagine how important this is for the little people,

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,900
right?

88
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,200
So somebody like, Molly rocket, my company, we're nobody, right?

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
We're a tiny little game Studio.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
We stream handmade hero, and we work on 1935 as a game, will never

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,900
have any clout.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,800
Anywhere will never have the kind of money necessary to pay off.

93
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,000
Comcast or something like that when we want to connect with our

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,900
customers over the Internet, sell them a game that they can download

95
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,100
over the Internet, any of these sorts of things, handmade hero, right

96
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,300
now, when you go buy a pre-order of handmade here, when you could

97
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,500
download the source code, all that stuff, we are relying on the fact

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,800
that you can do that in a reasonable time using a reasonable internet

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
connection because we're no one special.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,700
We're relying on just Fairplay there that you can get our stuff just

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
as fast as somebody who might

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
Have billions of dollars and ways of leveraging a contract with say

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,900
Comcast in order to get better treatment.

104
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,900
So it affects really everyone who uses the internet as a primary

105
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
aspect of their life.

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,600
Which at this point, is basically everybody and it affects all

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
businesses as well, no matter how small they are.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,200
If you rely on the internet to connect with your customers, not having

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,500
the protection of something like net neutrality, real net neutrality

110
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,800
means that you can suddenly become behold.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
In to extort of behavior by the isps because they could basically just

112
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,200
shut down your business, anytime they want by enforcing some kind of

113
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,700
draconian regulation at their whim, that forces you to pay for access

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,100
to your customers in ways that you maybe can't afford.

115
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
So, not only is it a huge problem for big corporations who don't want

116
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,200
to see a lot of their money going to this, but it's also much even

117
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,600
more threatening, really to small businesses because, although the,

118
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,800
you know, Google could probably afford to Pony up this money.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,300
Want to, but maybe they could other businesses just can't, there's no

120
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,400
way they could let the, the right deals or pay.

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,100
The right amount of money.

122
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,700
They just don't have that kind of cloud.

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,300
So, net neutrality just makes a tremendous amount of sense, in terms

124
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,000
of the way, a society should function our ability to talk to each

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,900
other, should be fair, and Equitable, no matter how big or small you

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,800
are, no matter who you are, no matter what side of the political

127
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,800
landscape, you're on, no matter what work, what kind of work you do?

128
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
Do or how you do it.

129
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,000
It's just like electricity.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,100
You shouldn't get worse electricity because you didn't strike up a

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,500
deal with the electrical company.

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,300
To give you kind of fair treatment or something like this.

133
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,500
You should just be able to pay the same price as everyone else for the

134
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,900
same service as everyone else.

135
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,100
And it's uniform.

136
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,000
This is just a good way to run utilities because it leads to the

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,900
fairest Behavior without a lot of bad like extra t''v.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
For by looking at what you do and determining whether or not, they can

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,600
try to pressure you to try and get more out of you, right?

140
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,400
So I think there's really not a lot of arguments against it.

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,700
You do see some arguments out there that aren't particularly

142
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,900
compelling, of course, being made by isps, and they have to do with

143
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,900
things like trying to encourage them to invest more in their

144
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,600
infrastructure and all these sorts of things.

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
And to be completely honest with you, those things just sound

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,100
absolutely ridiculous to me.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't see how you can look at something so reliable as the

148
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,500
electrical service in our country.

149
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,200
For example, like my

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,100
Electricity almost never goes out.

151
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,400
It certainly goes out less than the internet goes out for example and

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,200
it's a much harder problem.

153
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Like electricity is much much harder to deal with.

154
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,300
In fact, the internet companies rely on the electric companies to run

155
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,100
their service.

156
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,800
So it's kind of ridiculous to say that something that doesn't need.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,400
To have this kind of extort of power where they think about, who is

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,000
buying their service, and who is using it?

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,300
For what to say that?

160
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,700
For some reason internet, service providers who have one of the

161
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
easiest jobs there is in terms of utility production.

162
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,600
Certainly easier than electricity certainly easier than water.

163
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,900
I don't know, it's probably not male may be the only one that it's

164
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,400
similar to in terms of cos I don't even know.

165
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,100
But point being they have a really easy job.

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,900
So their arguments about why it's

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
It's a problem for them.

168
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,400
Really don't hold any water and pretty much just sound like smoke

169
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,900
because they've never pointed to some reason, why all these other

170
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,000
utilities seem to be able to do a totally reasonable job?

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Providing things without any of this ability, even the phone companies

172
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,800
were able to do this, just fine being common carriers and yet they

173
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,600
somehow can manage to do it.

174
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
It's just not possible for them.

175
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,800
They're so confused about how to put down a fiber optic cable between

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,500
Points that they just don't know how to do it without the promise of

177
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,800
being able to charge Netflix extra for streaming to your home or

178
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
preventing you from using BitTorrent, right?

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
That's just they they just can't do it because it's so darn difficult.

180
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,900
And so I think it's important to just keep that in perspective and

181
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,400
realize that while there's a lot of smoke out there, it's just a 10

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
second thinking about how hard their job is versus how hard other

183
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
utilities jobs are can pretty much tell.

184
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,200
Tell you that this is just hogwash, it's just a case of them wanting

185
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,000
ways to make more money and they're willing to tell you whatever it

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,700
takes for you to maybe believe them.

187
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,200
But I don't believe them and you shouldn't either.

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,100
So that brings me to where we're at today.

189
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,200
Which is that the FCC due to the way, the American system of

190
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,000
government works, basically, we have a legislative body, we have our

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Congress and they pass laws.

192
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,000
But one of the things that they are allowed to do per, our

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
constitution is they are allowed to delegate their authority, to

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,500
institutions that they set up essentially that are then dealt with

195
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,200
under the executive branch of the government.

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,500
So effectively what happens is,

197
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Our Congressional or legislative branch in this country.

198
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,700
Does something like say we don't want our cells, meaning our, as a

199
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,400
congressional body we don't want to sit around trying to micromanage

200
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,400
the you know, Communications infrastructure of the United States.

201
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,700
We simply want there to be one and we want it to follow some

202
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,900
reasonable guidelines.

203
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,700
So we're going to create a bill that creates something like the FCC

204
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,900
which is one of these institutions which will oversee those

205
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,000
Education infrastructure questions for us.

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,700
There are many of these sorts of sort of entities, in the United

207
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,200
States government.

208
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,800
And they are essentially created to do these day-to-day Services.

209
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
The SEC would

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,300
Other examples on the screws Exchange Commission that is the one that

211
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,500
oversees say business investing in stocks, stock markets that sort of

212
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,700
thing publicly traded companies.

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,600
So that's just how the government works.

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
And so the FCC is effectively the body that has been delegated.

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
The authority to enforce something, like net neutrality.

216
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Now, to be clear Congress, still has the authority to do something

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,100
like pass, a net neutrality law and it would be really great if they

218
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,500
did.

219
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Unfortunately, we've never

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
ever been able to get them to do that.

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,500
Now, that's something we'd still love to have them do, and there's no

222
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,700
question that pressure should still be applied to Congress.

223
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,000
Should just pass a law that says that you have to have net neutrality

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,500
because then it's out of the fcc's hands.

225
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,300
But for the moment because that Authority has been delegated to the

226
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,900
FCC and Congress has not passed a law, specifically specifying, that

227
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
the fcc's hands are tied in this matter.

228
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,300
It means that the discretionary power to do something like

229
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,800
enforcement.

230
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Try ality is with the FCC and what the FCC has done last year.

231
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:13,600
I believe thankfully is, they have decided to assign isps as a

232
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,400
category to, What's called the common carrier designation that I

233
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,500
referred to earlier, which says that they are not allowed to

234
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,500
distinguish between services on their utility, they have to treat

235
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,800
everyone equally which is really great and it's exactly what we

236
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:29,900
wanted.

237
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,500
Want.

238
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,900
Unfortunately, it's an FCC rule.

239
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
Like I said, not a law passed by Congress.

240
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,700
What that means is that much as the FCC have the authority to make

241
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,700
that rule in the first place and to compel isps to follow it.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,700
It also means that they can repeal it unilaterally without going

243
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,300
through Congress.

244
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Because remember, Congress has never spoken on this issue, they didn't

245
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,200
say we had to have net neutrality, they left it up to the FCC.

246
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,500
So,

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,100
What we want to do now is prevent the FCC from repealing that

248
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,200
designation that they so wisely adopted last time thanks to an

249
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,400
outpouring of public support and corporate support much like the one

250
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,200
that we're trying to do today here on July 12.

251
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill out a comment to the SEC

252
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
that is the way that you can communicate with the SEC that you think

253
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,800
that net neutrality has to be enforced and how it has to be enforced

254
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,000
name.

255
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,100
Through a common carrier, designation or something even more stringent

256
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,000
than that.

257
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,200
And I would encourage anyone at home who hasn't already done this, to

258
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,800
do, exactly the same thing.

259
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,700
If you have the ability to write a comment to the FCC encouraging

260
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,000
them, not to get rid of that common carrier designation, that would be

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,700
really great because the more people flood their server with comments,

262
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,900
the more it's clear.

263
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,800
We mean business.

264
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,700
And remember,

265
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You don't want to pull any punches here.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,200
So is, you know, a bunch of comments to the FCC.

267
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,700
Necessarily going to change anything, not necessarily.

268
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,100
But when you couple like, millions of comments to the FCC website,

269
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,000
plus a bunch of really powerful companies like Google and Facebook,

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,800
and Twitter, all sending their lobbyists to Congress, telling them,

271
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,400
that they're going to be really pissed off.

272
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,800
If this happens, you get a huge amount of media storm around it.

273
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,100
You get Representatives getting asked questions about it.

274
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,800
That is the kind of political pressure that can get things done and we

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,400
I know that it's true because that's how it got done in the first

276
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,700
place.

277
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,100
That's how it got added the first time.

278
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Congress didn't tell them to do it.

279
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,300
They never pass a law.

280
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,800
It was simply public and corporate pressure on the FCC directly that

281
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,900
created the political climate necessary to do it.

282
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,900
So I think it's still possible today because if there's one thing

283
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
that's definitely true about American politics, it's that if the

284
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
people and Powerful Corporation speak together, that's kind of hard

285
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,900
for anyone in government to ignore, if just the people

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,500
Speak and not the corporations.

287
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,700
Well, maybe not so much, but in this case, that's not the only

288
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,800
situation, right?

289
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
We're not going into this as poor little just regular old voters

290
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,700
without huge pocket books.

291
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,300
We have a bunch of really powerful players on our side.

292
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,700
So now is the time to basically unload, all the barrels, just blanket

293
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,200
them with as much comment on this as we possibly can.

294
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,700
So that they know that we mean business and everyone else does too.

295
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,400
So if you want to know how to do that, there's a couple ways you can

296
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
do it but really Google can guide you.

297
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,500
If you just say, FCC comment, everyone knows what that's going to be

298
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,200
today and you can read a lot of different things about it.

299
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,900
So for example, I'm going to write one right now and you can look at

300
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,100
what I say but you don't have to do what I do, right?

301
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,700
You may have different opinions about it.

302
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,800
You may have other things that you want to say, you may have other

303
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,400
ways, you want to say it.

304
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,200
So there are a bunch of articles that will come up here like ARS

305
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,300
Technica technica's article how to write a meaningful FC.

306
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,600
You can't Sprint reality.

307
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,600
That's the one I looked at for the link and you can also look at wires

308
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,500
or there's all sorts of other ones out here.

309
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,700
You can you can do in order to find the link because it's a little bit

310
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,000
of a weird link as you can see but also to get some extra

311
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,700
instructions.

312
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,300
If you forget how to do it, or where to go, or what sorts of things to

313
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,599
say, there's write-ups about it everywhere.

314
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,200
So, take a look at one of those and there's also, I believe a dear FC

315
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,599
c-- dot org.

316
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,300
I want to say, did you

317
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,600
Go to from the Electronic Frontier Frontier Foundation.

318
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,600
That will also help you write a letter to the FCC as well, which you

319
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,200
can do.

320
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,100
So this is another one you can do.

321
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
That's separate.

322
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,700
So if you have time to as far as I know, they're actually separate.

323
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,200
I don't quote me on that, but I believe let's see.

324
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Is it actually?

325
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,500
Or is it not?

326
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:48,800
I don't know.

327
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
They may be the same.

328
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,300
I just don't know whether this is a different one or not, so if you

329
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,100
want to just be safe, fill out both of them.

330
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I already filled this one.

331
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,100
I'm going to fill this one out as well because I don't know what goes

332
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,900
where and I want to make

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Our that every possible thing I can comment on I did because this

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,500
one's been up for a long time for a very, very long time.

335
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,800
So anyway, this is the one that I'm going to be filling out today

336
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,200
because I already filled out the other one a while back.

337
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,900
And the way we're going to do it is when you come to this thing, and

338
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,200
if you want to type it in directly, you can hear HTTP

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
www.fcsexcel.com.

340
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,600
A CFS.

341
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,700
/Search /.

342
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300
Proceedings question.

343
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,100
Mark Q:.

344
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,200
Name: open parenthesis.

345
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,700
Open parenthesis 17-0.

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
108 closed, parentheses close parentheses.

347
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,000
It's quite a mouthful but there you go.

348
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,800
And what we're going to do is click on this plus Express button here.

349
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,500
And so what we're going to do is we're going to put all of the

350
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
information in here and then we're going to put in the comments now I

351
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,800
saw this probably not a good idea to give out all of the address

352
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,100
information for me on the internet at large.

353
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,700
So I'm just going to put in my comments and then we'll end the stream

354
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,000
and I'll submit it but you get the idea, right?

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,900
All you got to do is just

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,700
Put your information in here and then you put your comments in here.

357
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,100
Now I also don't know why I have to apologize.

358
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,500
I don't know whether it makes any difference if people who are from

359
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
foreign countries, fill out these forms.

360
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm guessing that since the FCC is probably a very America Centric

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
organization.

362
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,900
They just don't I mean you can see here they don't even have a country

363
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,800
field, right?

364
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,100
So I don't really know but what you can see here actually, when you

365
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:37,300
look at it right is some of our sort of non-state but, you know,

366
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,700
related territories in one way or another are on here.

367
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,600
So, hey, maybe you're from one of those places just because you're not

368
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,600
from one of the 50 states does not mean that the FCC won't listen to

369
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,900
you, I guess now.

370
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,300
If you're from a foreign country apparently the SEC don't listen to

371
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,900
you because you know, they're just I don't know.

372
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
Because why would you want to listen to other countries?

373
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,400
It's not like the internet's Global or anything I guess.

374
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,500
Yeah.

375
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,200
What can you do?

376
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
That's that's a, that's just the way it goes sometimes.

377
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,300
But anyway, point being fill in this information.

378
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,100
I don't know if you can do it, if you're outside the country, but if

379
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,500
you're inside the country or territories, then you can and you've got

380
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,400
a drop down for you.

381
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:21,900
So definitely

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,100
Do that and then write your comments in here.

383
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,300
So here's what I'm going to say.

384
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,500
Dear FC c--.

385
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:43,100
I believe that keeping the internet free and open is one of the most

386
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,300
important challenges.

387
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,900
That I witness in my lifetime.

388
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,000
The internet is arguably the most important.

389
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Look utility that.

390
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Any municipality can have in this day in age, especially considering

391
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:26,300
it is increasingly used to access government services, as well as all

392
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,800
the important Services people use their day.

393
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,900
Daily life.

394
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,600
Keeping it.

395
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,900
Equitable and accessible to.

396
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,900
Everyone rich or poor.

397
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:58,100
guess I want to be more broad here, let's just say keeping it open

398
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,900
accessible to everyone regardless of

399
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Their situation.

400
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,400
In Life or their ability.

401
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Negotiate.

402
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,800
Enter into special contracts.

403
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,500
should say, and every

404
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Go give me a nickel accessible to every person and every corporation,

405
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,300
regardless of their, their beans, for popularity.

406
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,500
Ability to negotiate or enter into special contracts with isps.

407
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,600
Or.

408
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,100
the amount, The Leverage political

409
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,300
social Bridge, they possess.

410
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,800
Is.

411
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,900
Sake.

412
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,700
It is absolutely crucial.

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,900
To be fair and just Society.

414
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,000
That we keep.

415
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,700
Equitable and accessible to every person and every corporation

416
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,500
regardless of their means should say

417
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,600
Here's your glasses are means or popularity ability.

418
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,500
Greater interests of comes with isps, or the amount of political or

419
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,600
social leverage.

420
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,000
They possess.

421
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,600
I guess I would say.

422
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,800
The internet is increasingly the.

423
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,900
Exclusive way in which many Americans as well.

424
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,300
Well, I guess I'll just focus on Americans here because I guess we've

425
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,000
determined that the FCC

426
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Is America only in this form.

427
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,700
So let's just say Americans in this case if the internet is

428
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,100
increasingly exclusive way in which many Americans exercise their core

429
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,000
rights rights Garin paid to them by

430
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
The Constitution.

431
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,700
It's great spelling there.

432
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,000
So, I guess I would say the ability to speak publish.

433
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:02,400
Publish really the ability to access the courts and receive due

434
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,100
process of law.

435
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:12,400
The ability to remain informed Main, and informed and educated.

436
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:14,900
Citizen.

437
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,400
and,

438
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Guess we'll leave it.

439
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,300
There are all now.

440
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,800
Inexorably tied to Equitable.

441
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:44,000
Access to the internet large.

442
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:53,100
Guess I'd say Facebook, Twitter or should say sites such as Facebook

443
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,700
and Twitter.

444
00:25:53,800 --> 00:26:04,300
Twitter has become the new Public Square and streaming audio and

445
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,100
video.

446
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
Has become the new.

447
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:20,500
Wikipedia has become the standard factual reference and streaming

448
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,200
audio and video has become the new

449
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
It should also include.

450
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,500
Internet.

451
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,800
I should I phrase this such as Facebook and Twitter become the new

452
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,400
Public Square.

453
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,300
Wikipedia has become the standard factual reference, and most press is

454
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:58,900
now consumed digitally rather than by a print or television.

455
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:14,700
There is no longer any way to argue that the primary functions of

456
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:24,000
being an American citizen are not intimately tied, to one's ability to

457
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,800
access the internet.

458
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,900
Fairly and equitably.

459
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,600
Internet service.

460
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,700
Providers may claim that there are reasons.

461
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,100
Why.

462
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Designating them as common carriers.

463
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:09,700
is harmful to their business or why it somehow will produce less

464
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,500
Beneficial outcomes for the public at Large.

465
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Be important.

466
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,900
Regardless of the arguments here for their merits.

467
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,500
The important fact remains that it is irrelevant.

468
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:48,100
How they view their business and their situation, we must ensure fair

469
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,300
and Equitable internet access for everyone.

470
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:04,200
And if isps determine that, they cannot provide this utility in as a

471
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:12,100
common carrier, then they should be relieved of their duties to do so

472
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:21,300
and we can replace them with a standard utility model such as the one

473
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,200
that works.

474
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,100
Perfectly well for electricity water and mail.

475
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,600
There is no question.

476
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,600
That.

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,900
Services significantly.

478
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:46,900
More complex than internet service are being successfully.

479
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,100
Provided every day.

480
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:51,900
on a

481
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
common carrier basis.

482
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,700
and any

483
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,500
And thus, it is crucial.

484
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,400
It is clear that isps must meet this responsibility.

485
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,100
If they are.

486
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,300
in order to continue to,

487
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,500
Receive.

488
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,400
Publix permission to operate at all.

489
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
That's really all I have to say about that.

490
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
In closing.

491
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,100
I strongly urge you not to repeal.

492
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,300
The common carrier designation.

493
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:14,500
SPS, anything you should be expanding the degree to which

494
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Companies that deal with and provide internet services fall under this

495
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,000
criteria.

496
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,900
All right, so what do we think here?

497
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,100
Yeah, I'll put this in a notepad in case we lose it.

498
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Abner.

499
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Coimbra says, someone said there's a possibility to choose an

500
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,400
international address.

501
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,800
ah,

502
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,900
there you go.

503
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Ah, perfect.

504
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,700
I did.

505
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,800
I miss that little check box.

506
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,900
There you go.

507
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,300
Okay so cool.

508
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,400
You can you can fill it out so fill it out.

509
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Even if you're not from the United States, fill it out, it can't hurt,

510
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,100
right?

511
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,000
If they don't read it, they don't read it.

512
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
But it only takes a little while to write one in and I'll make you

513
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
feel good anyway because at least you got to say your piece.

514
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,400
You can even stream it.

515
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,000
Like I did.

516
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,200
So other people will hear you say it or you can post it on your

517
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,800
Twitter feed, so everyone can read it.

518
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,900
And remember, it's true that they're not really probably going to read

519
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,300
these but you want them to receive tons of big male, right?

520
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,900
The idea.

521
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,800
This is, this is like the, you know, just the full volley.

522
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,100
This is, this is the like firing all of the guns, right?

523
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:25,200
We're trying to just like absolutely bombard them with tons and tons

524
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,400
and tons of letters that look different, right?

525
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,900
So they're not for male.

526
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,000
All right, so let's finish this.

527
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,300
I am writing.

528
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,500
Two.

529
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:07,900
Virtue as strongly as possible to continue designating isps as common.

530
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,300
Carriers.

531
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,500
This is a small type of they should be relieved of their duties.

532
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:47,400
All right.

533
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,699
So, there we go.

534
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,000
So I guess this information will be publicly available via the web so

535
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,600
I guess I can fill it in because it won't actually make any

536
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,200
difference.

537
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,300
Everyone will see it.

538
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,600
Anyway, I guess week I can use my mailing address so that's fine.

539
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Anyway, because that's on the domain name, name of filers

540
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
KC the tree.

541
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,200
Kiss it.

542
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,100
Molly rocket.

543
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:36,300
So address is 113, Cherry Street, 706.

544
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,700
Seattle.

545
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,700
98 104.

546
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
All right, folks, here we go.

547
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,300
So you gotta love the fact that the FCC like they couldn't even make

548
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,500
the website, like, handle Carriage returns.

549
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,800
They're like, yeah, you know, we're qualified to make decisions about

550
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,300
isps but we don't know how to like have like Carriage turns in the

551
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,800
comments.

552
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,600
So you know it's I don't know.

553
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,000
Just just don't know how we would do it.

554
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,100
Friggin mystery man.

555
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,100
All right, so there we go, folks.

556
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,200
We have sent it and they have received it.

557
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,500
Now go do yours as well.

558
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,600

559
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,300

560
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,600
Go to sleep.

561
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,100
