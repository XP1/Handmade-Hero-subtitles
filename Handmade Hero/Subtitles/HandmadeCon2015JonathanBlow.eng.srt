1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Next speaker, of course, again like pretty much everyone at handmade

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,400
Connie's our introduction but it's kind of a unique, a bit of a unique

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,700
perspective which is that the the games that John's worked on have

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,500
obviously been ones where there's quite a bit of like design and

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,900
programming kind of coming together.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,900
So it's there it's sort of a, I think, perhaps a little bit of a

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,800
different perspective than people who work Strickland technology, such

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
as myself, who don't sort of think about the design, don't sort of

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,400
think about those things.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
But on handmade here, obviously we

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,200
He's tried to focus on the programming part of programming, but even

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,400
though we don't ever really get into that design stuff, if you are

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,900
going to be someone who works on programming, and who works on these

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
sorts things in the game industry, it's something that you really have

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,000
to be aware of because, like, a big part of whether the design works

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,800
are a big part of whether it goes, well, is whether or not that whole

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,000
sort of like overlay of programming and design works well, and does us

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,400
for thing.

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,200
So, the thing that I really wanted to talk to John about was kind of

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,900
that that sphere of what does it mean?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,100
Mean you know to have like the the technology and the programming sort

22
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,000
of like conflict design and how does that process work?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,300
All those sorts of things and I couldn't think of anyone better to

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,100
talk about it because well he's one of the best programmers.

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,600
I know and he's one of the best designers.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:11,900
I know.

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,600
So let's-- Joan please give a warm welcome to mr.

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Jonathan Blow.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Oh, are you on?

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,700
We got to unmute you.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,500
Just a little switch on the top.

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,100
I think I saw the red light.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,900
It's it's deceptive.

34
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,300
There's been a shortage of chocolate eating is what I'm getting at.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,900
So, yes, I've got all of this to myself, except for whatever I leave

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,900
for Ron at the end, so which is up to you, I guess, right?

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
You could decide to leave it.

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,000
Nothing will find out the president.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,100
I should have put some aside.

40
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,500
All right, so so first of all, let me say thank you for taking time

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,200
out of your schedule to come to this at this time because the witness

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,900
is like a month away, Randy.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,300
Here to Saint and he's hurt.

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,800
So we have let the games ladies, both of our fault.

45
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
But thank you so much for coming.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,500
I sort of I guess like I hope this isn't that loud actually but I

47
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,700
wouldn't worry about it.

48
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,300
I mean, it's, you know, it's part of the Fireside Chats a fireside

49
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,500
chat.

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,800
It's meant to be intimate.

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,100
And if you get the mic right up to like, get the little like squishy

52
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
sounds and

53
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,600
You say that like, it's funny but I was doing Kemp voice at various

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,300
times for over a month month and a haircut.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,300
And when you recording stuff straight into a mic in a little room and

56
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,700
listening to it, it's really kind of disgusting actually like when

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
you're really paying attention to it professionally.

58
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,600
So, yeah.

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,000
All right.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Well, you can choose to be a disgusting as you want.

61
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
That's that's up to you.

62
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
That is my policy.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
So let me start out by well, actually, let me start out by actually

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,100
getting the, the Mischief window back up here.

65
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,800
If we can

66
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,100
There we go, in case you want to draw, let me start out by saying, so

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,000
what I kind of wanted to talk about and it's going to be a little hard

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
for me because like I saying beforehand, like I have worked with you

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,900
before and I kind of know a bunch of stuff about the way you like to

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,800
approach things that's our stuff.

71
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,500
So I'm going to try as best I can to pretend to forget all that so

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,100
that I won't leave things out when I'm asking questions.

73
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,800
But I apologize if I can't do it.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,200
I'm going to do my best.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,900
But what I want to talk about is like if you look at sort of the

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
Game image working on now in the game that you did beforehand.

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
So if we look at braids and the witness one of the things that I think

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,200
is kind of really remarkable about those projects is that unlike most

79
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,200
games that I see the degree to, which the programming is customized,

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
to the design is like dramatic.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Like there are games where there's just a tremendous amount of actual

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
code that seems to go into the design if that makes sense.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,300
I don't know if you would agree with that or not, but that's kind of

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,600
like as an external person.

85
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,900
It's not like oh we made a little thing that allows

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,900
To swap the gems.

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,400
And then we just made a little leveler that we place the gems and

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,700
whatever.

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,600
And like, off it goes, it's didn't look like that.

90
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
So kind of what I want to start off talking about is

91
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,200
How do you look at, you know, development, these days because you do a

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,900
lot of the programming you did, you do a ton of the programming on the

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,600
witness you did trying to programming on braids, almost all the

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,399
program braid?

95
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,300
How do you look at Development coming from it?

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,000
From that perspective of I am both the main person who is thinking

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,400
about how this game works as a game, but also I'm the person who's

98
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
doing all of the code for it.

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:31,900
Like this.

100
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,600
What does that feel?

101
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,200
Like, when you sit down, what do you thinking?

102
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
How does that go?

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
There's a, there's an analogy.

104
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,600
InDesign.

105
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,400
In the situation with design and running a team trying to get the game

106
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,800
done, right?

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Because even braid was a small it was you know me with there's a few

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
people people helping out.

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,700
It wasn't all me doing everything right but there's an analogy to what

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,000
Mike was talking about at least during the object oriented or data

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,400
oriented design talk.

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,500
And possibly a little bit today, which is just right.

113
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,700
You have a, you have a problem, right?

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,500
And the correct mindset.

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
He was saying this about

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,200
The meat boy thing, the correct mindset is to do, what is required to

117
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,300
solve the problem, right?

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,500
And that abstractions that come in are really only useful to the

119
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,500
extent that they help you solve that problem in the most efficient,

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,900
expedient, whatever way, right?

121
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,300
So to begin with, right, the barrier between design and programming is

122
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,200
only an abstraction, right?

123
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,600
Okay, first of all it has there are certain Contours that that sort of

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,100
tends to conform to you in reality

125
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,800
Because if you can type code and make it work versus can't, that's a

126
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,100
hard that's something in reality, right?

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,000
But, but that's not really a thing that determines disciplines, unless

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,100
we decide that it does, okay?

129
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
So, what is the problem, right?

130
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,500
The I just said, all this is determined by what solving the problem,

131
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,800
the problem.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,900
Is I want to make a certain game, right?

133
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,300
And when I started a game, I don't even know what the final design is,

134
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:06,500
right?

135
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,700
It's there's some idea and a direction to go to pursue the idea and

136
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,500
metric and the metric is the important part of, how good does this

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,400
have to be for me to want to ship this, right?

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,300
And not have wasted my time and fortunately with the stuff I've worked

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,100
on so far.

140
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,200
It becomes apparent early on that.

141
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
We're going to hit that and then it just becomes a ton of work to hit

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,300
it, right?

143
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Okay.

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,800
Now, how do you hit it, right?

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
So if the problem is we want a certain game that's at a certain level

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,200
of quality and it's not just about quality as some abstract scalar but

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,500
like there's an idea behind the game that we want to do justice to,

148
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,800
right?

149
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,400
So in grade there was some stuff about time and if we didn't explore

150
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
that much about time, it wouldn't have been that interesting of a game

151
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,900
even if it had like

152
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,700
Cool platformer physics or something, right?

153
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,800
It wouldn't it would have failed to be about what it was trying to be

154
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,600
about, right?

155
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,900
So there's a, there's a Precision idea where there's, there's

156
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,400
something that you're trying to machine, right?

157
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,200
Like if you have a lathe, you're trying to get all the curves, exact,

158
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,700
right?

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,000
So the Machinery has to be sufficient to make those curves, right?

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,500
And so whatever, whatever makes that Machinery work, well and

161
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,600
efficiently is the right thing to do to the most part.

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,400
There's some

163
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Of orthogonal human factors like the people who work with you hate you

164
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,700
and want to kill you and you know whatever.

165
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,300
But if you only if you're only time Horizon is the when the day of the

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,500
game ships, yeah you can simplify all that.

167
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,400
And so when you're sort of describing it in that in that way, you're

168
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,600
sort of saying that the metric is sort of this that's that's the the

169
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,700
game design.

170
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
I guess what you're choosing to.

171
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, the whole point I just

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,600
Guys, I failed to get to the actual point of why I was saying all that

173
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,100
stuff.

174
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,600
So your team or whoever is working on the game, is this tool, right?

175
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,800
And the point that I was trying to get to is when someone designs and

176
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,900
programs they are inherently much, much more accurate of like a

177
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
tooltip for the lathe.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,400
Can someone designing talking to someone who programs.

179
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay, you have communications barriers, right?

180
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,100
You have the fundamental Communications barriers between any two

181
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,400
people.

182
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,400
Then also, you have two people who think very differently about

183
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,800
problems, right?

184
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,200
That's because I'm Different disciplines and you have people with

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
different goals because everyone has different goals.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,299
Now, I've been so if you're a designer right, and you tell a

187
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,600
programmer do this and that, and that, and that, right?

188
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,000
It starts to become a little bit of a resentful situation because it

189
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,800
is the designer, the programmers boss.

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, why should that be, man?

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I went to school and learned all this stuff and I work really hard and

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,400
this guy just says ideas of what to do in their

193
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,600
Stupid, like half of whom aren't going to work, right?

194
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
It's a fundamentally.

195
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a little bit of a

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,700
Messed up way to set things up.

197
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,600
And yet that is assumed by default to be the way that you should set

198
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:05,800
them.

199
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,500
Upright.

200
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
And I've been the passive-aggressive programmer on the other side,

201
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,100
which, where it's like, oh the the instruction is too.

202
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,900
And you guys all know what I'm talking about by the way, right?

203
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Where it's like, okay, program this and I'm like, I'm gonna make it a

204
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,200
little different than that, right?

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
And then and then you have an argument with the other person about why

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,900
it's not exactly what they said.

207
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,100
And maybe sometimes you make up a reason why it has to be the way that

208
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,700
you want it to be.

209
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,400
This is just human nature.

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,400
But but then if you're at the, if you're in charge of the whole thing

211
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,800
and trying to make it come out accurately, that's going to be maybe a

212
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,300
little messed up, because it in my position.

213
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,600
As the passive-aggressive programmer, who is doing the thing that I

214
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,300
believe was most interesting or best.

215
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,300
That's inherently a different idea than idea, for the whole game,

216
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,900
which was not my idea to, you know, and so there's

217
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,900
At the same time though you have to make a framework for people to

218
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,900
have creativity and get like if you don't let the program or make any

219
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,400
decisions, he's going to be very unhappy and do terrible work.

220
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,100
And what so you just have to make sure that everybody can make

221
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,900
decisions and be creative and do the best work and have this Arc where

222
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
they're getting better at everything they do.

223
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,900
But also, it has to all come together with great accuracy or

224
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,600
Precision.

225
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,500
People get pedantic about accuracy versus Precision.

226
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,000
Every time I read that

227
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,100
Still never remember, which is which so it seems understood in this

228
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,700
context.

229
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Yes, you're like so talking about that specifically though.

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,000
You still do a tremendous amount of the game, play programming, yonsei

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,600
the witness, even though there are several programmers, who work on

232
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,100
that project, you you actually still do a ton of that.

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,400
And you think that is an essential part of the active design in the

234
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,700
game.

235
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,400
For the way that I design it is right, because because I don't decide

236
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,000
on day one or year one.

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Like, here's the whole game.

238
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,700
Here's the design document, and now our job is to go paragraph by

239
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,100
paragraph.

240
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,000
The design document make it happen, right?

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,500
And that's a strong man because nobody really does that anymore.

242
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,000
But, you know, there's some interpolation knob you can dial from like

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
extreme waterfall.

244
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,900
Everything is decided in advance space shuttle or whatever and you

245
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,000
just have to fill it in and like

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,700
We're just winging it every day, right?

247
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,700
And neither one of those is very successful for game development,

248
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:26,800
right?

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,600
You have to be somewhere in the middle.

250
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
But I am a big believer.

251
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,500
So what interests me about design is that I'm discovering something,

252
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,700
right?

253
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,300
I have an idea about what I want to explore in designing the game and

254
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,800
sometimes it sounds really stupid and it's hard to communicate like

255
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,300
why do I want to make a game about tracing some panels, right?

256
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,500
Like a line, right?

257
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
That sounds completely stupid.

258
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,600
There's actually a very deep idea and you know because you've played

259
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,300
the game, right?

260
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,500
It's

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Very interesting, what happens?

262
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,800
Spoiler warnings?

263
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,200
Well I'm not going to spoil the game two months before it comes out

264
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,500
but you know so there's there's something there that's being unrolled

265
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
or Unravel, you have to find it.

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
And at the beginning, I have the idea of what it is.

267
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,700
In my idea of what it is, is not even what the idea of what it is.

268
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,000
Will be, by the end time we get to the end, right?

269
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,300
It's a starting point, right?

270
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
So it's sort of so you have to be able to iterate.

271
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,800
It's like an iterative actual it

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,400
or solver.

273
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,000
It's like we have to seed it with initials, guess we know that that

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,700
initial guess is not actually the answer.

275
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,600
So we're going to have to go through some process try and actually now

276
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,900
find where the answer and like any iteration process, the speed of

277
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,300
iteration matters in the accuracy of iteration matter.

278
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,600
So if you want to get to somewhere, very refined, you had better be

279
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,100
able to iterate quickly, and you had better be able to understand the

280
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,600
results of your iteration.

281
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,300
To a deep degree and when that's all in one person's head, it works a

282
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,200
lot better.

283
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,700
Okay?

284
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,000
Right.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Because I don't have to communicate the results to myself.

286
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,300
I just look and I know, right?

287
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Like when I went, you know, if I program some interaction and I go

288
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
play it and I just know.

289
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,600
That's like at least a week and a half of coordination and okay,

290
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,200
correspondence between multiple people to get that same result because

291
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,400
you're the results appear yet.

292
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,900
Give an example of why that blows out to meet people who don't know.

293
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,300
You're talking about sort of like the concept of I have to tell

294
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,400
someone I wanted to do.

295
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Then it's not going to be quite like what I wanted or is that like,

296
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,700
let's send that out a little bit.

297
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,400
Any one of those steps is fractal, right?

298
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
Like I'm going to tell someone what I want to do.

299
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Right?

300
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,300
Step one is impossible, actually, right, unless you're doing something

301
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,800
very wrote like unless you're close

302
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
Somebody else's game like yours Zinger.

303
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Somebody in your just like, we're going to change the way the farmer.

304
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,700
Looks?

305
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,200
Right.

306
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,600
Instead of gems, we want fruit this time guys.

307
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,200
Yes.

308
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,700
You know, trying to make some R&D games which means that I'm not, you

309
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,900
know, pretentious art where I can write down what the theme is like.

310
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,800
The theme is don't throw a stone if you live in a glass house, right.

311
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,100
Okay.

312
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,400
Right.

313
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:05,600
Okay.

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,900
But the theme is something that I barely have traction on, because

315
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
that's what's interesting to me, right?

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,500
If it's like, if the theme is, don't buy a bad piece of computing,

317
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,300
Hardware that?

318
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, I don't know.

319
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,700
Some, some topics are simpler than others, right?

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,500
And if you're artistically driven, you're probably going toward

321
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,300
nuanced topics, okay?

322
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,200
And those are the things that if you could communicate it without

323
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
making a game, you wouldn't make the game because you could just write

324
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,000
an essay or I could record myself talking on YouTube for 10 minutes

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,500
and I would have to spend six years making a thing where you trace

326
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
panels, right?

327
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,800
It's much more.

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Shit way of communication through.

329
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,000
So step, one designer explains to programmer.

330
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,400
What needs to happen is actually not possible, Right?

331
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Which is then why these feedback loops get really snarled, which is

332
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,600
all there are some things that look extremely irrational, sometimes

333
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
that actually,

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
Are a result of that process being not possible like oh the designer

335
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,200
was saying, do this and do that and do that.

336
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,900
And then one day they just turned around and all that stuff that we

337
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
worked on they just threw it out.

338
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,300
The window.

339
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,200
It obviously wasn't that important, right?

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,500
Yeah.

341
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:12,700
Yeah.

342
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:21,500
And what it really is is sometimes things are just very intangible,

343
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,800
right?

344
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:27,000
And you're trying to get a certain feeling or a certain sense and the

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,800
way we do even in my own head, I might try one Tack and all

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,100
That's not really doing what I want.

347
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
So let's go over here, right?

348
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
And when you externalize that into multiple people, it starts to

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
become more wasteful of a process.

350
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,500
Which at some point then these external like lack of resources.

351
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,600
Lack of time limits that process and limits where you can get to in

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,100
the end and how well you can get there.

353
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,400
And how many people you piss off on the way and who quits your team's,

354
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:51,900
right?

355
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Or who quits the game industry completely.

356
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,500
So it's, it's a very complex thing and just like with

357
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,200
Just like, with strictly programming the fewer people that you have

358
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
working on a program.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,700
The better it's going to come out because there's just not as many

360
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,500
problems.

361
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,700
Yes, it's the same multi-disciplinary situation.

362
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:17,500
So, I guess taking a look at that and mapping, it kind of onto the

363
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,200
programming part of that to like because, you know, you have to do

364
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,300
this iteration, right?

365
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,100
And you're looking for this idea, you're like I have sort of a search

366
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,800
space in mind.

367
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,600
I have these things I want to

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,400
Lore and as I explore, I'm going to come up with new things I want to

369
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,600
explore and so on it just implies also just at the coding level that

370
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,200
there's going to be a tremendous amount of flexibility in whatever you

371
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,400
make.

372
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,800
Meaning you can't sit down and just know that I'm making, you know,

373
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,000
they can't be Wolfenstein 3D or something where it's like, I know that

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
it's this thing and we're going to make this rendering engine and it's

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,200
this.

376
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,800
We base, they're making sort of like a Clockwork kind of a thing,

377
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,300
right?

378
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,100
It's kind of got to be this this understanding at the very outset, I

379
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,700
would say

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,599
The way that the code is going to be written, has to be designed for a

381
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,300
lots.

382
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,700
And lots of fungibility, would that be a correct statement?

383
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,800
Yeah, so tell me a little bit about your perspective towards that and

384
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,400
has it changed over the years and it hasn't really changed.

385
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:22,400
I mean, so what I'm going to say here about how to program this stuff

386
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,200
is not even you know?

387
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,600
So so on the team working on the witness right now there are I'm not I

388
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,800
can't

389
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,500
Not be counted as a full-time programmer.

390
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,400
I maybe like a third to half a time at this point, because I'm doing

391
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,300
all this content stuff and whatever but then there's three full-time

392
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
programmers on the team.

393
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,100
So what I'm going to say is my opinion, which I communicate to people,

394
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,900
but the way the team works is I just let people do what they want

395
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,100
because it's still small enough that that can happen.

396
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,300
But the, the way that I work is, I type the absolute simplest thing

397
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,700
that will go in the right direction at a given time.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Less unless I detect while I'm typing it, as often happens like, oh,

399
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
this isn't really right.

400
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,500
Deleted change, right?

401
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,500
But like the, the way I've talked to you about this before I think,

402
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,300
You know, all right.

403
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,100
Something like okay, I

404
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,500
Trying to think of an example that is not a good example.

405
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to write something that just handles the line tracing and it

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,900
needs to be efficient.

407
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,200
There's almost nothing you could do.

408
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,700
That would be inefficient, which is why it's not a good example

409
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
because computers are fast.

410
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,000
But, you know, I've got to do something that manages the data

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
structures of like what are you doing on this panel and yeah you know

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
because when the when the lying is going to cross over itself.

413
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
That's a very simple Collision detection problem.

414
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,400
But you have to do it.

415
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:46,600
Yeah.

416
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,400
It has to it has to be and and you may decide to weeks later because

417
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,100
it's early in development.

418
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,500
That wasn't really the kind of interaction you even wanted, right?

419
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,300
So you do want to spend a lot of time on this thing.

420
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
So you just write the absolute simplest thing.

421
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,500
And usually, what that involves is ignoring everything you learned in

422
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,100
school about how to program well, okay, right.

423
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,500
Because most of what we learn about how to program.

424
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, is, is like insurance policies against bad things that will

425
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,700
happen.

426
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,300
Wait later?

427
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes, some other time by another person.

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,200
And a lot of the time, of course, those things will never happen.

429
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,500
Yes.

430
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,100
So that's in those cases, it's wasted work but even when they will,

431
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,800
And even when I know I'm going to need to replace this thing, probably

432
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,900
a year from now, I don't care because a year from now I'm going to

433
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
have a better idea of what it needs to be.

434
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,500
Anyway, right.

435
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,700
So today I'm just going to make the simplest thing that I don't have

436
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,000
to think that much about it's kind of crappy.

437
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,300
It's not going to scale that well, but it is going to let me it is

438
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,500
going to be very modifiable.

439
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,600
That's the other aspect, right?

440
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:55,900
Right.

441
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
So the more you optimize something, the less you can modify it.

442
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,100
Yes because optimization is you know, you have a very

443
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,800
A general thing which is like code that you know where performance is

444
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
not a deliverable of the code, right?

445
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,800
Just functionality and then the more performance is a deliverable.

446
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
That's not really a thing, right?

447
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,700
It's performance on specific Hardware is a deliverable so then you

448
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,100
have all these tendrils about how it is.

449
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,700
The code interact with hardware and the more you optimize.

450
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,500
The more you just squish this Play-Doh of the program onto the Contour

451
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,300
of the hardware till it's like a hundred percent of it.

452
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,100
Yes, is all determined.

453
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,600
Many by your CPU architecture or whatever, right?

454
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
You don't want to go that far in that direction, if you know, you're

455
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
just going to replace something later.

456
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,700
Right now, the reason all this works is because it's not like we're

457
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
delivering a game on a blistering time scale.

458
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,600
Like if you only have time to type something once and deliver it, then

459
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
you can't do this.

460
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,500
But if your concern is I'm trying to make the best design, right then.

461
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
I'll program it five times.

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,800
As if I need to.

463
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Hey, this is an attitude.

464
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
It's very different today.

465
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,300
But when I got into games, you know, I started my first game company

466
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,500
with a friend, the absolute worst time to start a game company, right?

467
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,800
Yeah.

468
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,500
It was January 1996.

469
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Yep.

470
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,700
Cue test.

471
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,300
Came out, like, February something 1996.

472
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,500
If you guys remember that, we were just figuring out how to do 3D.

473
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,800
Yep, it was all software around.

474
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,300
Yep.

475
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,900
You know, like a handful of people in the world knew how to do this

476
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,100
efficiently and you decide to a network game.

477
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah.

478
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,800
Networks multiplayer server client.

479
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,100
Server drop-in Dropout.

480
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,800
He was amazing.

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Yeah, nobody played it.

482
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,400
I tried to find a screenshot from that game.

483
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah, either way and failed.

484
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,100
I could not find it.

485
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,500
Okay.

486
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,100
There's like one that's like the sequel to it or some.

487
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,700
Yeah.

488
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,600
Well it was swindling game that we kept.

489
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Yeah I was like but anyway anyway

490
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
Who was I talking about?

491
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Well you got me was asking you about sort of the degree of

492
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,800
flexibility?

493
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,400
You need in the code in?

494
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,100
You were talking about why?

495
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,300
Well, you were talking about why it's possible to do it the way that

496
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,000
you're doing it, because it's not in the short time scale, and then

497
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
you said there's an attitude.

498
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,900
We didn't quite get to the attitude.

499
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
That was different.

500
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,500
Oh, right then than it is now so back then, you know, I started as a

501
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
programmer with some ideas about design, right?

502
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,700
So, I on this first game, I was right in the 3D pipeline, right?

503
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
I was writing the texture map.

504
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Where you trying to be perspective, correct and do the fixed Point

505
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,700
math, and all that good stuff.

506
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Right?

507
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,400
And computers, were changing fast enough, that four months later,

508
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,100
literally at the height of it for months later, Your Design decisions

509
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,400
would have been different, right?

510
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,300
Because they are going to be changing like a 486 66 and then like a

511
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Pentium, something right?

512
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,900
It's just like what?

513
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,200
Yeah.

514
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,100
And you didn't understand 3D that.

515
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,300
Well, so, you know, one of the reasons this game wasn't that good is

516
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,700
because we

517
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,300
So much time, programming it, but that's because what you had to do,

518
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
you had to do that in those days to have something that runs fast.

519
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,300
You know?

520
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,200
I mean, the story about how much iteration Carmack in a Brash did on

521
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,700
Quake.

522
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes.

523
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,800
Like they did at zillion things.

524
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,200
Yeah.

525
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
And that's what we did in those days because that's what you had to

526
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:10,900
do.

527
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,900
And now the attitude is different because there's this natural thing

528
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,800
of like oh I programmed this it just I just got it to work.

529
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
It's so precious.

530
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,700
I'm going to put it over here.

531
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay?

532
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,500
And it's done and we're never going to, you know, she and it's in the

533
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,000
90s.

534
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,700
He was like, no.

535
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,800
The day you finish it is a day.

536
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
You start rewriting it, okay?

537
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,100
What?

538
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,500
By the time you get to version 7 of your texture map or maybe it's

539
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
okay, right?

540
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,200
That's kind of the same sort of a process to as with the design

541
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,400
process.

542
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
You're talking about where it's like, it's more of a search process

543
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,900
where it's like, we don't really know exactly what we're building

544
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,200
here.

545
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,900
And the only way to gather enough information to know what we are

546
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,300
supposed to build is to build something, sort of like it first.

547
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:51,500
Yeah.

548
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,600
See what happens, right?

549
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,300
Yeah, you got it.

550
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,600
You got it.

551
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,200
To jump in the pond before you can find things in the pond I guess,

552
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,600
right?

553
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Or something, that's not exactly what I was thinking.

554
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,800
It's a murky pond so you can't really see.

555
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,700
Got a grope around.

556
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,300
Yeah, fish.

557
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:06,900
Get in the way.

558
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,300
Yeah.

559
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,900
Light you fish in the pond.

560
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Yeah, okay.

561
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,500
Well, so moving back to, I guess, sort of the, the original part about

562
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,900
structure in the code for that flexibility, right?

563
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,400
Yeah.

564
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,800
So when you sit down, you're going to do the absolute simplest thing

565
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,300
possible.

566
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,600
Right?

567
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,200
Which I've heard you say before, as well as like kind of just a

568
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,100
general good mindset to be in which I totally agree with is, you know.

569
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
I don't want to overcomplicate this thing.

570
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,500
And so probably my first intuition, especially if you've been

571
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,900
programming for a while, your first intuition, on how to write it is

572
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,200
probably good enough for that first pass and if you try to overthink

573
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,700
it at that time, you don't have enough information to make a better

574
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,800
decision anyway.

575
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,500
So in general, that does seem like a good mindset but

576
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,200
I do feel like on a lot of projects, right, that doing that to

577
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
exclusively ends up with a thing that's just a mess and you can't

578
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
experiment and it anymore because it isn't Flex one of us.

579
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
So I feel like you actually have some, there's a skill.

580
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,700
There's there's a layer on top of that.

581
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,300
That I see you do that.

582
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,300
That does have to do with it.

583
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,700
You know, like the property ID systems and those sorts of things,

584
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,700
there are sorts of things that you've started to develop.

585
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I feel like in the way that you build games that are designed to allow

586
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,300
you to have that mindset in the small while not

587
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,800
During a disaster in the large was wondering, if you could maybe share

588
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,000
some of that respect.

589
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,000
Well what you do is first, you don't have the skill and then you have

590
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,400
a lot of disasters, right?

591
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,100
You see what the pattern was of what happened, right?

592
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
And you build it.

593
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,600
And what it is is just

594
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,800
You know, I'm going to write something messy.

595
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,000
And first of all, when I do this, I'm visualizing.

596
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,100
What is the day when I'm going to swap this out for something better

597
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,600
if I need to and how?

598
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,400
Well is that going to go?

599
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,000
And how is that swap out going to happen, Okay?

600
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,300
And then, right because there's a small number of people on the code

601
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,600
base, at least at the team sizes I work at.

602
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,200
You have to know that every time you go back and interact with that

603
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,700
thing and you constantly reality check it, right?

604
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,800
So, like at some point if it starts to become a different thing than I

605
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
thought, because

606
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,200
You know, one day, we added this other way to query this system and

607
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,300
then that sort of became the main way because I grew out and became a

608
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,500
bulbous Apparition at some point.

609
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,100
You then you have to interdict and say no.

610
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,700
Okay, we don't any longer understand the situation and maybe it is

611
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,800
time to refactor this or something, right?

612
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:37,100
But so would you say that if I was to sort of restate that as a

613
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,400
method, it's kind of like, okay.

614
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm writing this code and even the first time that I write it, I kind

615
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,100
of like play act in my head what if this was really important, like it

616
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,300
turns out that this test thing that I'm doing here.

617
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,200
Thing that I'm playing with on the design or whatever the code, If

618
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,500
This Were to become very crucial that it work quickly or do something

619
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,800
or, you know, that it's going to have ramifications.

620
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,500
Games or whatever, you're going to kind of go through that in your

621
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,100
head a little bit even during that first, right?

622
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,600
Or only right after the first, like, where does that first thing

623
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,700
happen when you have enough experience, you can do the first pass at

624
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,200
that like it's reflexive.

625
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,700
So just happens because know when you have the idea of what you're

626
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,600
about to type.

627
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Yeah part of that idea is

628
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,700
Here's the life cycle of this thing about type, right?

629
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,100
And, and you just know,

630
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,000
You just you have a feel of how Harry is this thing, right?

631
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,900
And, and those of us who have been around a long enough to type a lot

632
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,500
of things, most of what we type.

633
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,000
Just doesn't even set off any alarm Bell, right?

634
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,700
I mean, almost everything that I'm going to do.

635
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,400
I just store some stuff in an array and iterate over the array like I

636
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,300
pulled some things out of here, a right.

637
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,500
Like, it's not that part of her grabbing is not the right.

638
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,900
The at some level of experience, the hard part's all come from complex

639
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
systems, right?

640
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,700
And interactions that were hard to predict, when you sat down right

641
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,700
initially.

642
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,500
And so, I would say the other part of what, what I'm not saying yet or

643
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:14,600
what.

644
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Feel is lacking from what I've said yet, is that the other reason to

645
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,200
keep those components simple is because that later part is the

646
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,400
important part, and okay, you want to prep for that later part as as

647
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
well as you can.

648
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,800
So if you prematurely optimize, for example, the problem with

649
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,500
premature optimization is not only that you spent the time to

650
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
optimize, okay, right.

651
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,300
It is also

652
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,100
That after you have optimized, you've produced a piece of code that is

653
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,300
more brittle and has more connections to the rest of the code, right?

654
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,500
So if you have some graph and each piece of code is like it Circle in

655
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,600
the graph, right?

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,600
There's some level of connectivity of what number of things talk to

657
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,000
other things.

658
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
And I don't even mean via function calls.

659
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,500
But like, you know, this thing you know, data is set up in a certain

660
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,800
way.

661
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,400
And same day, this guy needs to know that and this guy needs to know

662
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
that there's something right.

663
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,900
There are constraints that

664
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Happen and complexity the way I visualize it.

665
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,200
And this may not be the best way, but it's the best way that I know of

666
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,800
complexity is just the number of arc's in that graph, right?

667
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,200
So if you have n modules in N arcs, there's just all connected one by

668
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,400
one and it passes through that's an ideal program from Heaven, okay.

669
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,300
That does not exist in reality but is very simple because we can just

670
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,700
modify the front and back half of any piece of code and the Ark.

671
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Now can be whatever we want because yeah, and the point is let's draw

672
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:38,900
this.

673
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,900
This your mind.

674
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,200
Yeah.

675
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,300
So this is you know this is like an amazing simple piece of code right

676
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:46,600
now.

677
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,200
The thing is, you know, if this is I don't even know what this is

678
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,700
like.

679
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,900
This is some user interface, right?

680
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,200
And this is like simulation.

681
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,100
I render this program is so simple.

682
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
With no point.

683
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,700
Putting these because already this is wrong because, right?

684
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:14,100
Your UI cares about rendering so, but you know what happens, a real

685
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
program, right?

686
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,800
Is something more like this, where you got a bunch of things and just

687
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
start drawing these all day, right?

688
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:28,500
Because these these just go forever, right?

689
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah.

690
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,000
So

691
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,900
Complexity management of software is about reducing the number of

692
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,600
arc's because actually the arcs are way harder to think in school you

693
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
usually, you know, you usually think about the circles because that's

694
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,300
what they teach you to think about.

695
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,400
Like, oh, this is an object and it has these policies and everything.

696
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
If everything could be inside this object and that would be totally

697
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,700
fine.

698
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
But that's not reality, right?

699
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
In fact, most of what you care about is actually in these arcs that

700
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,700
I'm just messing up by drawing arrows, to the arcs, almost always

701
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,300
determined things even at the optimization stage like

702
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:02,900
Foreman's.

703
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,400
It's almost always about the arcs and not so much about what goes on

704
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,500
in Academia.

705
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,300
The arcs are called cross-cutting concerns, which makes him sound like

706
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,000
just one little extra thing you should think about sometimes.

707
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Actually, it's almost everything that you care about especially and

708
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
the more optimized your program is the more of these that you have

709
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,000
right.

710
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,300
And even so you know the number of arc's that you can draw between n

711
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,900
circles is O of N squared.

712
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah so we completely optimized program

713
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Is O of N squared and gives you N squared.

714
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,800
More things to think about, whereas the perfect beautiful program that

715
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
doesn't exist is n, right?

716
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,700
N squared is a lot bigger than n as n grows.

717
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,100
Yes.

718
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,200
So part of what's happening is keep N squared.

719
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Small?

720
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,300
It's just like optimizing runtime.

721
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,900
Yeah, right.

722
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,800
But you're optimizing.

723
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,200
How many things I have to think about?

724
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,400
However, right.

725
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,400
I mean, I've said all this, you know,

726
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,200
Like optimizing code makes the code more complex and create these

727
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,600
problems.

728
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,700
But we also have to optimize the code, right?

729
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:11,400
So there's a very intelligent trade-offs that have to be made about

730
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,700
what deserves complexity and what does not and you should be able to

731
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,700
justify those by mapping them all the way.

732
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,100
Again, if we're talking about some lathes with extreme, accuracy by

733
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,600
justifying it, by mapping it all the way to that final shape, that

734
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,700
you're trying to cut, okay?

735
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,100
Like,

736
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,800
Hey, this piece of the curves going to wobble a little bit.

737
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,000
If this thing isn't running at 60 frames as whatever, right?

738
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,300
So in some sense you might say that when you in your head like you're

739
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,900
thinking about this system and you're like what do we actually need to

740
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,200
think about in terms of its complexity or how it's going to be

741
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,800
designed or whatever?

742
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,800
You're actually in your head thinking about the end state of that the

743
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,200
game itself and what its design needs.

744
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,300
How critical is this thing?

745
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
This doesn't erase it should erase their, yeah.

746
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:00,900
Yes.

747
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,300
Now and of course that's always just a heuristic, right?

748
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,400
Because you never, you never quite a future.

749
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,400
And so, would you say that that's true on, you know, that could say

750
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,500
well I just I just wanted to if anyone like Zips to the middle of the

751
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,700
recording or something, I want them to at least have some idea of what

752
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,600
the picture is.

753
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,100
And that picture was completely dominated by this line, it's perfect.

754
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,500
Now, it's a totally

755
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,700
yeah.

756
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:26,900
it's

757
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,800
self-explanatory.

758
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,500
Yeah, everything else as well.

759
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,100
So really, I guess, let's see 35.

760
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,300
So really, we can just take the next 30 minutes off because if

761
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,000
everyone just looks at that diagram for long enough, they'll get the

762
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,600
rest of it.

763
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,100
Pretty much by by osmosis.

764
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,400
Yeah, by diffusion.

765
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,000
So, okay, taking that a little more concretely.

766
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,600
So your structure at the outset when you're talking about something

767
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,500
like this, right?

768
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,600
I mean, I'm going to explore, you know, I'm putting myself in your

769
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,400
Shoes here.

770
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,100
Yeah, I have some I'd design ideas that I've started out with and

771
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,900
we've already said that, I have to iterate on these design ideas quite

772
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,600
a bit potentially to get to, you know, depending on what the game is

773
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,500
to get to the final place where I'm actually comfortable that we got

774
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,600
it.

775
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,900
Like, it's like, okay, we got to the place.

776
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,100
I actually wanted to get to.

777
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,199
So I have to do a bunch of iterations and these iterations obviously

778
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,300
are going to, first of all, involve creating new nodes to this graph,

779
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:21,500
right?

780
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,100
I'm adding New pieces of code and also obviously new arcs to the graph

781
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,300
as those go, right?

782
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,600
Yeah.

783
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,699
So, I guess what I would say is,

784
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,199
I'm approaching each individual node that I add.

785
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,900
I'm approaching each one of those as here is a piece of code that I'm

786
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
going to try and write as simply as possible.

787
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
And I'm not going to try and overcomplicated just whatever gets the

788
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,400
job done in this engine, right.

789
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,699
But then there's a separate part which is that all of the inputs into

790
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,100
that like whatever has however it has to get the stuff that it needs,

791
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,400
which in a game like for example the witness is actually extremely

792
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,800
complicated.

793
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,600
There's so many things that it might be wanting to know about, you

794
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,800
know, as far as like what it needs to do to actually test this part of

795
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,500
the design.

796
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,500
What's your thought process?

797
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,400
Like for keeping that I want to say superstructure in place, right?

798
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,300
Because that's sort of the policy or like the services that are

799
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
servicing the arcs between these things.

800
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,900
Like, you know, there's a bunch of things.

801
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Like the thing I mentioned the other day to you which is like it's

802
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,500
pretty impressive that over the entire development, the witness you

803
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,100
could almost always still load a save game, right?

804
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,000
Like, tell me a little bit about that sort of background of how that

805
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,500
works and are there things in particular, that you've learned over the

806
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,800
years there like having systems work, this

807
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,100
Way tends to make it much easier for me to do the small pieces in a

808
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,800
way that doesn't start screwing with the whole system, right?

809
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,200
Well, the you know, the reason the reason we can load a save game

810
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,600
specifically so I'm not sure that I understand really the question at

811
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,400
a general level, so we might have to iterate for a little bit, but the

812
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,700
save game time specifically.

813
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,400
All right,

814
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,300
That is just the same system that I had in braids, which I had

815
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,200
arrived, just through experience, right?

816
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,600
Like,

817
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,900
You need to serialize your stuff, you need that to be robust and good

818
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,100
and pretty fast.

819
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,100
And you need it to be flexible, right?

820
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
Although I don't get carried away with flexibility.

821
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,500
So for it, we actually just had this conversation in the office.

822
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
The other day we are not forward compatible, right?

823
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,000
Okay.

824
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,700
So you have an old executor if you have a new execute old executable

825
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,100
in a new save game, right?

826
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,600
We crash right now voting.

827
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,200
That which is fine, but we want to do.

828
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
About that for release, probably cuz you never know what's going to

829
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,800
happen to have in the wild, I mean, on a console, it's probably fine,

830
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,600
but I'm PC.

831
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,900
But again, that's relatively easy to add, right?

832
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,900
But the main concern is backward, right?

833
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,300
Like you want people, you know, we push, we push updates on Steam all

834
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,400
the time and to the greatest extent possible.

835
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,500
We want people to just get the update and playwright with whatever

836
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,300
savegame and

837
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,200
That's worked ever since our first build went on Steam, which is

838
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,800
several years.

839
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,000
At this point, the main thing that breaks it is content, right?

840
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,900
Like we push content that

841
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Right, you change where you were in.

842
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,300
The prison has been standing on the thing that you move your.

843
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,400
Yeah, that's obviously not going to work but I mean in general, if the

844
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
game could be playable, usually was yeah, my experience.

845
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,200
So but that was just again, you know, having enough problems and

846
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
having to solve them, seriously enough that at some point you just

847
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,100
arrive at an opinion of what's the best way to program?

848
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,900
It's the same reason I don't use list now, right?

849
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
Okay, team, right.

850
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,300
It's what I want of the things.

851
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,200
I was taught in college, was how cool scheme is, okay?

852
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,500
For all.

853
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,000
The reasons that now I do not care about because I have evaluated them

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,100
in the context of The Wider world and discovered that I don't care

855
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,800
that I can use a redevelop print Loop because that's a very primitive

856
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,500
thing that almost never gives me useful information, okay?

857
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
Or I don't care that the syntax is all parentheses in that.

858
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,000
That's beautiful from subjecting, right?

859
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:03,200
So in that same way, you know, there's there's just problems.

860
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,900
That you have when making game and one of them is serializing and

861
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,100
whatever right?

862
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,300
And once you have her down those problems so well that like there may

863
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,400
still be issues but they're Epsilon compared to all these other issues

864
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,800
that you have you just consider that solved and you don't need to

865
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,600
worry about it unless you someday come up with a design that

866
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,800
challenges those assumptions.

867
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,800
But I think the more experienced we get the more that that happens.

868
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,600
So when I started in games,

869
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,300
Nobody knew what a quaternion was right.

870
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,200
It was a while before we saw that and then and then there were debates

871
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
about whether that was the right way to do things.

872
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,400
Right?

873
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,800
And now usually people like a quaternion is I think now this default

874
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,200
thing yeah there's reasons why you don't want to use one for specific

875
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,900
cases but in general it's solved.

876
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,300
Yeah.

877
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,800
So serialization I feel like is most

878
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,900
Solved, apart from issues of how the hell you interface with the

879
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,000
programming language and stuff.

880
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Because write C++ is terrible for it.

881
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,600
Very tear.

882
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
So you have to make a decision.

883
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,400
Like, do I

884
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Do I do something where I pre-process header files right and pull the

885
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,200
data and then do that or do I just force you to do extra work?

886
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
Every time you declare thing, I went for option, b force you to do

887
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,600
extra work because I had terrible experiences with option.

888
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,200
A when I was a contractor in The Wider world, like I did a summer at

889
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:37,300
Sun Microsystems messing around and like they're gooey thing was

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm forgetting the name now but the sun they used it'll like a version

891
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,800
of it'll look like a priest.

892
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,100
Like answer that you would you would generate a thing and it would be

893
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,400
okay.

894
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,000
It was an annoying, build step, and then you'd get a header file full

895
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,300
of integer, IDs that would change every time, okay?

896
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,900
Right.

897
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,000
So that was, they didn't even solves it was a shit, right?

898
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,600
It just, it was annoying.

899
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,700
And I like,

900
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,300
I like knowing what's happening and I like keeping the core of stuff

901
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,600
simple and just my experiences with that were bad enough.

902
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,600
Yeah.

903
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,700
But you decided not to that.

904
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,600
You wanted to be more manual just because of that.

905
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,800
Yeah, I also had some bad experiences with some

906
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
There's like this language informix 4gl.

907
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,000
I don't know if anyone in the audience this is but he was like a

908
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,500
language that people would paste on top of SQL.

909
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:26,900
Okay?

910
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,900
To like, try to add value and in reality, it would like to pre-process

911
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,100
down to SQL, commands, that we're not really checked in the right way.

912
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,100
So okay, then you get an SQL error and you have to like map it to your

913
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,800
source code.

914
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,900
So genetically in me I hate that stuff.

915
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,000
Okay, I've had so many problems.

916
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,500
So you want some?

917
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,900
So yeah.

918
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,800
We're is too much detail and something that doesn't warrant that much

919
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,200
detail.

920
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,100
But well, I actually so I have a follow-up on that that even from

921
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,700
that, which is that.

922
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:01,200
So in general would you say that you start out with certain ad hoc

923
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,000
code for these things?

924
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,700
Like I'm going to write down and write the simplest possible thing

925
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,500
certain core systems.

926
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,800
Stay around long enough through multiple projects that it's just like,

927
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,200
they get refined to a point where now they're no longer kind of a

928
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,300
question in this.

929
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,400
Like in your node graph, for example, where it's just we big those

930
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,900
down to, like, we can rely on.

931
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,100
This is how this should probably go and everyone else can just assume

932
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,200
that.

933
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,000
That's the way that's going to go kind of a thing.

934
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,100
And you've got a point now on it or is it is like, know it's hard in

935
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,800
the systems are the system's sort of in some sense, conceptually a

936
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
little different now because they've gotten to a certain point of

937
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,300
maturity.

938
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
Or is it still always kind of the same attitude where it's like now

939
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,400
it's just another piece and well so in this particular case of the

940
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,000
witness

941
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,000
It was not even a question for example, again with entity State,

942
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,700
because I went from a game with a relatively challenging problem

943
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,400
statement around NBC, right?

944
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,900
It was about rewinding time and having it be perfect and being able to

945
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,100
go forward and backward in time.

946
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,500
So,

947
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,800
You know, there's a very robust serialization deserialization system

948
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,600
to go from that to what games, more typically want to do, which is

949
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,900
just like, I've got a level with some stuff course, it's an open world

950
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,900
level, so that was an ambitious part.

951
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:20,200
We have about 70,000 entities in our world, which is big for an indie

952
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,400
game.

953
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,200
Yeah, it's not really big for AAA game but those are all live at once.

954
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,300
So the, you know,

955
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,700
70,000 live entities, but that's not 70,000, is not a scary number for

956
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,100
a modern computer, right?

957
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,400
As long as you do something that is roughly constant, her thing,

958
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
you're fine.

959
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,200
Yeah, at that level unless you're the Windows File system and you put

960
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:47,300
70,000 files in one folder which we then had to do terrible things to

961
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,200
work around.

962
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,000
Yeah, well there's a directory perverse.

963
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,700
Only have 100 subfolders so he's not making this up.

964
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,200
This is actually a thing that actually happened.

965
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,400
So every every entity has a new

966
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,900
Clydie, right?

967
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
These days are about 6 digits and

968
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,500
Let me tell this whole story because mmm.

969
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,400
Yeah, right.

970
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,400
You think like, oh my God, how do you do multi-user collaboration?

971
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,700
It's such a hard problem because we're building this open world

972
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,900
environment, right?

973
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,800
And everybody's editing the world at once.

974
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,100
You can't really lock part of the world.

975
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,800
Just people do everybody changes things, right?

976
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,000
And like, how do you think that that's like, a really wicked problem

977
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,200
and all the way you think it is?

978
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,600
All your energies are very easy to read, text files and everyone's a

979
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,200
separate file, and you just check it into some version.

980
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,400
And it works fine.

981
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,000
And you don't, you don't do the one or two things that will break

982
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,300
that.

983
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,800
Like, the one thing that will break it is like you have a group of a

984
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
group of entities and people are adding and removing things from that

985
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,200
group all the time.

986
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,500
Yeah.

987
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,500
And you could make a source control system that understood the

988
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,500
semantics of oh, the order of things in this array, don't matter, but

989
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
in reality.

990
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,700
Yeah.

991
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,600
So instead, when we store things in groups, you have my energy stores,

992
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,400
the group I'm in, and then we reconstitute that reload time.

993
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,200
I think that's very fast.

994
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,700
Right?

995
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,800
But anyway, so every entity is a text file.

996
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,000
So we have 70,000 text files and Ignacio, just needed to speed it up.

997
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So, he was like, well, what if we make 100 subfolders by the last two

998
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
digits of the entity ID and then that's where you go to find what was

999
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,700
the slow part.

1000
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,600
So, you know, you you sort of approach this problem in very much

1001
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,800
exactly the way that you're saying.

1002
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,000
Which is that like you just said what's the simplest thing that would

1003
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,600
possibly work.

1004
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,300
Yeah, if we want to edit a whole world, it's built out of entities.

1005
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,500
Let's just make a different file forever and that's exactly what's

1006
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:31,900
good.

1007
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,600
Solve the conflicts as we know that it can merge text files.

1008
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,500
Yeah, right.

1009
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:35,800
Yeah.

1010
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,800
And so, and then we ran into and the simplest version of the system

1011
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,100
was like the simplest version of what you just said.

1012
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,900
And then we ran into problems with the group thing and like one or two

1013
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,700
other things.

1014
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,100
And then it started getting slow once there was a lot of content,

1015
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:49,400
right?

1016
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,200
And what got slow was it subversion?

1017
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,800
Just Windows barfs.

1018
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,400
When you get over a certain number of files, a full, what happened?

1019
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,700
Just around 11,000, when you go, where they can't like, open in them,

1020
00:44:59,700 --> 00:44:59,800
or

1021
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,600
I don't know, I don't know how the file system is set up.

1022
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,200
So what I mean what did you see happening?

1023
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,600
Well it's not a it's not a UI level thing.

1024
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,700
But yes, even when we would boot, right to start to read the files,

1025
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,500
you know, we use what's the freaking API, right?

1026
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,700
So like if you didn't create file or something like that, you know.

1027
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,300
Yeah, the find first file.

1028
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:26,500
Find next file regular that starts taking a really long time.

1029
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,100
Okay.

1030
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,200
So just iterating over the files that are actually Windows like at

1031
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,100
11,000.

1032
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,500
That's too many just starts going on.

1033
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,700
Nobody should have that many files in a directory so we're just not

1034
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,100
going to.

1035
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,500
Yeah.

1036
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,000
Okay.

1037
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,700
All right.

1038
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,100
So then you Bree had to break it up into separate directories and then

1039
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,000
iterate the directories.

1040
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,500
So you're basically just creating your own tree, which is what NT in

1041
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,000
theory should have probably doing, but yes, okay,

1042
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,300
All right, so that's actually worked remarkably well to I guess I

1043
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,300
hadn't thought about that but the fact that you can open world edit

1044
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,700
the witness and everyone can have the same time, they carry since

1045
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,700
mean, it's insane.

1046
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,100
And it's just a bunch of text files.

1047
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,400
Yeah.

1048
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,300
Well, in case anyone is wondering, whether the attitude of do the

1049
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,100
simplest thing works.

1050
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,700
It's pretty good.

1051
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah.

1052
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,100
I should have thought of that.

1053
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:06,400
Yeah.

1054
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,600
Glad We Came Upon it.

1055
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,100
I mean, there was that's not the only thing.

1056
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,700
There's a bunch of things like that.

1057
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,600
Like, the only reason that we are able to make a game.

1058
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,300
It's so games taken us a long time to make but it is a really big,

1059
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,300
really complicated game.

1060
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,900
There's like a lot of stuff in it and we're a very small team.

1061
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,500
We've got testers now.

1062
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,200
So I think we have eight people including testers various

1063
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,200
Swim in the dog and the dog.

1064
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Yes.

1065
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,200
09 team of nine, one of them only eats cupcakes in ever gets in.

1066
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,700
Yeah, bad hire but good for morale.

1067
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,100
so,

1068
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,500
You know, you have to like being able to build systems to let you make

1069
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,100
a game is a luxury, right?

1070
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,400
Yeah.

1071
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,400
Sort of it's necessary to a point and then it's a luxury and we

1072
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,700
straddle that line all the time and you know I'm not always going to

1073
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,900
claim in the best way, you just have to allocate your effort, right?

1074
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,100
Just like with anything, right?

1075
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,800
So there's something stupid in the game right now that we just have

1076
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,400
never fixed right?

1077
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,800
We do we're very focused on iteration.

1078
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,500
People have talked about

1079
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,400
Irrigation is important and we do that.

1080
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,500
You know, you can the game will just like Hot Load textures and all

1081
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,700
that.

1082
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,200
So you just change the text in Photoshop, you see it on the screen,

1083
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,600
our editor, and the game, or the same program.

1084
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,900
So you just hit f11, you're ruining the editor, which is a separate

1085
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,400
copy of the world, where you move stuff around.

1086
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,100
Hit.

1087
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,700
Save you press f11 again and all the stuff is moved.

1088
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,200
Right.

1089
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,500
There's like literally zero iteration time apart from inconveniences

1090
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:43,100
involved in how long it takes a start-up which is like probably 45

1091
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:44,000
seconds or something.

1092
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:44,800
It's that's more.

1093
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,500
Yes this side.

1094
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,500
I'd of tolerable.

1095
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,900
Yeah, but you know, there's things that are kind of terrible.

1096
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,600
So for example, if you're working on an animated entity with a lot of

1097
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,700
Bones and you change it, a lot, the game kind of crashes sometimes,

1098
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,700
because it hot loaded something with like a different number of bones

1099
00:47:59,700 --> 00:47:59,800
and

1100
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,400
Match something it didn't something didn't get cleared and it probably

1101
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,100
would take a day or less to fix but we just got too much to do and we

1102
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,500
don't edit animated things that much just like me just like sorry your

1103
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,500
game is going to crash today is in we just bear it, right?

1104
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,600
So there's there's always trade-offs there.

1105
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,100
So, I guess, one thing that I kind of wanted to get at with the sort

1106
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,200
of iterative model of how you're developing things and the systems and

1107
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:35,800
that sort of stuff is just I guess if you are, if you're working with

1108
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,300
other people who aren't necessarily iterating on the design, right?

1109
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,700
Because you've got programmers who are working on doing stuff like

1110
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,600
making sure the rendering works and that sort of stuff.

1111
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,000
How do you sort of manage that part of the process?

1112
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,500
Where you're trying to iterate on design?

1113
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,400
And other people are trying to build these other systems and you're

1114
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,700
kind of running in parallel because you've had now multiple years

1115
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,900
where actually, you have been adding stuff to the design.

1116
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,500
Like the design did not stop three years ago and then people have just

1117
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,500
been programmers, something you still had stuff, we have in some

1118
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,300
stuff.

1119
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,000
Two weeks ago.

1120
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,600
Yeah.

1121
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,300
So having that like like, can you talk a little bit about?

1122
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,600
Is there anything in particular to say about this concept of like,

1123
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:12,900
okay?

1124
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,000
How do we make sure that these other people who are trying to do their

1125
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,300
job of making, like the rendering fast or something?

1126
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,800
And I'm still trying to like change maybe have some of these puzzles

1127
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,400
work a little bit and I'm implementing some slightly new things

1128
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,100
code-wise in there.

1129
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,100
How does that?

1130
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:27,900
How does that work out?

1131
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,200
You have what?

1132
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,700
Like have a lot of interaction or you try to structure in the code so

1133
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,700
that they don't, you have to have a lot of interaction in the

1134
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,800
beginning so that everybody

1135
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,900
Stands with the hell we're doing, okay?

1136
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,600
And that's much easier to do with people who are actually on the team

1137
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,200
is full time.

1138
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,900
People is much harder.

1139
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,900
You know, we're talking about this in the context of programming, but

1140
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,000
there are other things that have functional effects on the design.

1141
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,500
For example, were working with architects who professional architects

1142
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,700
who designed buildings and like they'll design some buildings for the

1143
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,800
game but what they design.

1144
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,100
Is what you play and stay, don't understand game design.

1145
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,000
So, there had to be some very complicated conversations, they're

1146
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,500
right.

1147
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,000
And then, because they don't work for you, they're gone.

1148
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,200
And all that effort was wasted.

1149
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,100
At some point, is very high effort to result ratio, whereas someone

1150
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,900
who's a programmer, the team, it's a much lower effort to result ratio

1151
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
because they're sticking around.

1152
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,800
Hopefully, for at least a while, and they get it, right?

1153
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,300
And then also on my side because I understand,

1154
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,400
Programming generally.

1155
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,400
I don't even know what decision Ignacio made on the renderer this

1156
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,400
week, right?

1157
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,800
But I know how renderers work.

1158
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,200
Okay.

1159
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,600
So like I know preemptively, if I'm going to do something, that is

1160
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,700
probably maybe going to be slow, and then we can have that

1161
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,400
conversation knowing that you may need to have a conversation is much

1162
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,700
better than just like I did something and it breaks is my audio

1163
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,300
dropping out.

1164
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,300
It keeps, I think it's okay, it's a little echo.

1165
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
My ears are dropping out.

1166
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,900
I'm getting old well, one thing so,

1167
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,500
So I guess along those lines.

1168
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
Would you say that it's important?

1169
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,500
For somebody who's going to design a very ambitious game like the

1170
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,200
witness or something that would you say that the the programmer

1171
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,400
designer who's doing that sort of lead work that you're doing there?

1172
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,200
Is it kind of important for them to have an understanding of all of

1173
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,400
the systems that in some sense?

1174
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,300
Meaning the fact that you've worked on all of those yourself in the

1175
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,300
past, right?

1176
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:19,600
Yeah.

1177
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,200
Has that been critical meaning?

1178
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,900
Do you think that it would have been you know you know significantly

1179
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,600
worse if you didn't know how a render worked with that, opposed really

1180
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:29,900
difficult.

1181
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,900
It challenges for you.

1182
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,200
Yes, at many levels.

1183
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,300
So it would have made the game a lot harder to make.

1184
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,700
Okay?

1185
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,200
Right.

1186
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,800
So again, similarly did Mike's comment like you should go read the

1187
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,700
manual for the CPU, you're using like the engine is the manual for the

1188
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,300
design that you're shipping, okay?

1189
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,200
Right because how is that design ever going to happen if the engine

1190
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,800
doesn't but you can only do what the engine and we're bordering on

1191
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
spoilers, right?

1192
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,800
But and we won't go purely into spoiler territory.

1193
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,000
But

1194
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:01,400
but,

1195
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,500
Like a third of the design of the witness.

1196
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,100
Just what the ideas wouldn't have happened.

1197
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,300
If I didn't know how to program 3D Graphics, right?

1198
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,900
Okay.

1199
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,500
Like if I didn't know, okay, how RGB color were right?

1200
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,200
Yeah.

1201
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,300
Specularity and whatever, right?

1202
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,700
Like that.

1203
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,700
Yes.

1204
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:26,800
So that's what we would have had a much worse game, right?

1205
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,800
And actually, the same thing happened on braid on great.

1206
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,600
It's like,

1207
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,100
The first, like, really interesting thing in the design is how you

1208
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,300
have some entities in the world that don't get rewound anymore, right?

1209
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,000
They sparkle green and you rewind some things and it takes them out of

1210
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:41,600
sync with others.

1211
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes.

1212
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,800
And the origin of that idea was just because I was making the rewind

1213
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,400
and that function, like I said, everything is iterate over an array

1214
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,700
and do stuff on this function, was iterate over this array.

1215
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,800
And look up the old state of the sanity from this other Heap and copy

1216
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,600
this Fields.

1217
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,100
Yeah, and you was looking at that and your

1218
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,000
Like oh, I could skip some things.

1219
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah, that's the whole game design is like I could skip some things in

1220
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,700
this array.

1221
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,200
Yeah.

1222
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,000
And there you go.

1223
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,800
Yeah.

1224
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
And that's a, that's a programmer idea.

1225
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,700
It's not really, I mean I designer could come to that same thing but

1226
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:18,300
it would be a very different route and I don't know if I would have

1227
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,200
come to it by that route and I suppose some of the things to where

1228
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,100
you're like, the example of the world, where your x coordinate in the

1229
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,400
world equals time, it's kind of a very natural thing that you might

1230
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,100
arrive at as a programmer, which would be

1231
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,700
much harder.

1232
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,000
If you're just kind of sitting back there thinking about it,

1233
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,500
abstractly, you may never get.

1234
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,300
If you come at game design, like I want to make a metaphor for ya

1235
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,200
time.

1236
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,100
Being tied to my emotional state or something end up with something

1237
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:45,200
that sucks, right?

1238
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,100
I mean that's usually what happened.

1239
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,200
I'm not, I mean, games are designed that way.

1240
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,100
You can feel it when there's nothing that way.

1241
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,400
Right.

1242
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,500
You get something different.

1243
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,300
Yeah, I'm not trying to say that you can't design games.

1244
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,800
That way you can you just

1245
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,600
Put a great deal of effort into solving the problems.

1246
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,900
There's different problems, right?

1247
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,800
It's like when you make a program, that's an equation versus a

1248
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,000
program, that's if statements.

1249
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:08,300
Okay.

1250
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,700
It's very different in nature.

1251
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,700
If statements kind of suck, but you can make some very good things

1252
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,400
with them.

1253
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,100
You just have to put in a lot of work to make sure there's continuity

1254
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,200
between all the cases.

1255
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah, whatever, right.

1256
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,500
It's like that.

1257
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,100
So I think we are writing very talkative.

1258
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,600
I feel like I haven't said a thing.

1259
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,000
I think we've got, I think we got about 20 more minutes of sleep on

1260
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,300
the clock.

1261
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:29,900
So we have, we have

1262
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,300
We can go through a couple more things there is to it.

1263
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,100
So that's actually kind of, I'm going to ask a question about that

1264
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,600
even though this was totally not something that I had thought of

1265
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,400
asking it all before, but that's kind of an interesting metaphor.

1266
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,400
So you're talking when you said the, the S statement versus the, the

1267
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,900
equation there, it's really talk about things like well, if I have a

1268
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,800
single equation, I know that this thing is continuous and you're

1269
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,000
saying if I'm making a bunch of if statements to sort of model,

1270
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,500
something that I expected a continuous, I have to make sure that each

1271
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,300
of these cases, when you would be transition from one to the other,

1272
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,800
you will line up exactly with her.

1273
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,800
Yes, why

1274
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,200
You, why did you reach for that?

1275
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,700
Like like why did you go with that analogy?

1276
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,300
Just then I was a little thrown by it.

1277
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,100
What was I talking about?

1278
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,200
Were talking about the design of something being not programmer

1279
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,500
oriented, right?

1280
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:17,900
Oh, because so the way that I do design and I think that there's a

1281
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,900
small school of game design is a number of people who do things this

1282
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,200
way.

1283
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,400
Small number, a small number that I know of okay, and it's about, you

1284
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,800
know, we're building a system, it says the software is

1285
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,700
I've system that has some Dynamics.

1286
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,800
Yeah and you're exploring what the Dynamics are of those systems and I

1287
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,700
try to turn some way that minimizes feedback and so you can you can

1288
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,400
pilot where you're going in terms of that exploration.

1289
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,100
But fundamentally, you're exploring things that are there, okay?

1290
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
Versus

1291
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,700
I'm telling the computer what to do, okay.

1292
00:55:51,800 --> 00:56:00,900
And in this moment, you know, the princess steals a car and driver

1293
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,500
seat of drives to somewhere and something I don't know, okay.

1294
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,600
The point of that is totally arbitrary idea that you then need to

1295
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,500
force the computer to do.

1296
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,500
It's a different.

1297
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,900
It's going in different directions is Daniel been drug recalls this

1298
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,700
top-down versus bottom-up, but I don't say

1299
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,000
Because I think top-down versus bottom-up is very overloaded in a lot

1300
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,800
of other ways of thinking about different things, right?

1301
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,600
But it's similar, if you want to think about it, is top-down versus

1302
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,300
bottom-up.

1303
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,200
You can.

1304
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,800
And I do, I don't do just bottom up, right?

1305
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,100
I do, bi-directional.

1306
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:38,400
Yeah, but there's a whole lot of bottom up, and if you start fighting

1307
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,000
what starts coming, bottom up, you get something that sucks.

1308
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,400
So, basically, when you come at something from a top-down perspective,

1309
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,900
when you come at something, not one of the people who strictly does

1310
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:48,200
that.

1311
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:48,600
Yeah,

1312
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,300
You're sort of looking at that as more I'm coming at it from a

1313
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,800
top-down perspective and to make that a little more concrete for whom

1314
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,000
you are.

1315
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,700
I think about it that would be like I have this idea for this exact

1316
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,000
thing.

1317
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,800
The player might do in the witness.

1318
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,700
Versus here are some rules in the witness that might create puzzles.

1319
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,700
That would be like top-down versus bottom-up.

1320
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,200
Might be a reasonable way to say that or do you want to do?

1321
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,800
Want to have a more specific way?

1322
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,800
Well, the rules had to come from somewhere.

1323
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,400
Yeah.

1324
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,800
And that's really the bottom up as where they come from, so even lower

1325
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,100
than that.

1326
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,700
Yeah, like, okay.

1327
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,900
You know, I've got this line that I could draw.

1328
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah.

1329
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,700
And what, like, what are the properties of that?

1330
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,900
It's, you would think there's almost none, but there actually are some

1331
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,600
Some right?

1332
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,200
Is there?

1333
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,700
Do you limit the length of it?

1334
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,500
Is that, is that a dynamic, right?

1335
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:34,800
Right.

1336
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,000
Is it, can it cross itself, right?

1337
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,700
And those at first blush sound like arbitrary rules, but they come

1338
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,700
from a certain investigation of what are the parameters that play in

1339
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,000
this very constrained idea, space.

1340
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,400
And if I'm to be highly competent about exploring the small space,

1341
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,800
what do I do with those parameters?

1342
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,400
Right?

1343
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,700
Versus like a top-down thing would be like,

1344
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:07,900
You know, when I draw the line the alien spacecraft compute its heat

1345
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,800
ray in that direction.

1346
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,300
Yeah, and then I can burn a tree because that trees burning, I'll be

1347
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,000
able to read the book that's baked into concrete next to the tree or

1348
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,500
something, right?

1349
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,100
It's an infocom game.

1350
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,700
Yeah, infocom wasn't the worst at that.

1351
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,500
I would we all know who so sorry I meant to say it's a Sierra game.

1352
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,300
So I guess then I can go back with that in mind and ask the question I

1353
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,400
was going to ask before which is so you're sort of saying that the

1354
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,200
top-down approach when you do employ, it is more about giving you some

1355
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,800
more ideas about what to investigate to create the bottom up things in

1356
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,600
some sense, right?

1357
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,300
So like I come at it, I said like, oh, I wanted to do the thing where

1358
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,900
the alien spaceship shoots, The Burning Tree and lights up the book

1359
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,000
because I feel like that will tell me like that will generate more

1360
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,300
sort of like systemic rules that I can.

1361
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,300
And then use to create the problem with that example, is it's to

1362
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,500
systemic because light actually Shines on the book, right?

1363
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:07,800
Right.

1364
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,700
You would need something where like when there was a prophecy about

1365
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,600
the Burning Tree and then the old man comes running out of the Hut and

1366
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,200
and then you steal his Cane because you needed the cane to prop open

1367
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:18,700
the door.

1368
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,300
Exactly.

1369
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,300
That's the new example, okay, because there's nothing systemic there

1370
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:22,400
at.

1371
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,600
I'm not going to remember that, but well for it's a record.

1372
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,000
But for me, I need to remember it right now.

1373
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,300
We can't review the record when I'm going to ask

1374
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,700
Oh shit.

1375
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,500
For the original example, though, the light is the example of the

1376
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
bottom-up thing coming from the top down it.

1377
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,100
So if you're going to do it, right?

1378
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,600
Yeah, you're coming in at top down and you're saying, oh like this is

1379
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,500
a situation, I'm going to explore, what would be the but like what are

1380
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,000
the systems?

1381
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,400
I have to program to make this actually occur and then you get to the

1382
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:49,600
party.

1383
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,700
Like oh maybe light shining to illuminate things is part of my game

1384
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:56,100
rule set is that more of a way that would make sense like right?

1385
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,000
And then you have to decide how important of a part is it.

1386
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,200
Yeah.

1387
00:59:59,300 --> 00:59:59,800
And urea

1388
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,100
Set from time to time.

1389
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,100
Is my game really about this or not?

1390
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,200
Am I is my game design like an amoeba kind of absorbing this idea and

1391
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,800
in growing to support it.

1392
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,900
Yeah, that's a good thing to do to an extent, but then at some point

1393
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,000
you got too many things, right?

1394
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,100
Yeah.

1395
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,900
The thing other thing I was going to say, is the top down also.

1396
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,100
So it does two things.

1397
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,800
One is, it gives you a starting point, right?

1398
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
You have to start somewhere.

1399
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:25,200
Yes.

1400
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:29,400
And you could start purely bottom-up, but I have never done that.

1401
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:29,800
Okay?

1402
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,100
So, purely bottom-up as an example would be, you're literally just

1403
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,600
sort of starting to make like a physics.

1404
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,300
Sandbox, would be example of a bottom-up think.

1405
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,200
I'm just gonna start making some simulations, and I don't really have

1406
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,800
an idea of that, like, or is that not?

1407
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,400
You had the idea to explore a physics sandbox.

1408
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,700
Okay, but real bottom-up would have to be, like, I was working at some

1409
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,900
other job someday.

1410
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,800
And my program did something.

1411
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,700
And I quit that job because I thought that was interesting, and okay,

1412
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:55,100
right?

1413
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,000
Like pure bottom up is very, very hard to find, okay?

1414
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,900
I literally had no conception of what

1415
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,700
Going to happen.

1416
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,700
It just happened?

1417
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:02,200
Yeah.

1418
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,600
All right.

1419
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,600
But so then the other thing is top-down guides you because you're

1420
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,300
trying to go somewhere that has some human interest to it.

1421
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,300
If you purely there's a paradox, right?

1422
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,800
Because you have to be very interested in systems and what happens

1423
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,800
with systems and

1424
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,800
You know, you have to be able to observe and take joy in what's

1425
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,800
happening with your system and then make your design.

1426
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,900
Be able to show that to people and take joy in it and communicate that

1427
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,400
at the same time, if you find every system, interesting, that's going

1428
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,800
to be really boring to almost everybody in the world.

1429
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,500
Right.

1430
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,000
Okay.

1431
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,500
Because you have to have some sort of a criteria for what?

1432
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,800
Makes a system generally?

1433
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,400
Interesting.

1434
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,100
Yeah.

1435
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,000
Someone who's not a systems programmer or something, I don't know.

1436
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:50,500
Right?

1437
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,600
But again, that's also if you put too much,

1438
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,400
That in, that's what makes the game bad.

1439
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,200
So, so fine.

1440
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:58,100
It's a little pinch of salt.

1441
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,900
So I guess, let's see how much time we got now.

1442
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,500
Okay, so we're just about to wrap up, I guess.

1443
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:10,300
So, would you say in general, like when you sit down to do design work

1444
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,700
on a game quote unquote, is that really something?

1445
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,000
Is that really the way you think about it in your head?

1446
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,600
Or is it more?

1447
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,400
Just like I sit down to work on the game and whether I'm programming

1448
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,600
or designing in quotes or whatever are not really

1449
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:27,100
Separated activities or do you feel like there's definite like here RN

1450
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,700
modes that I'm in and I switch between those mode.

1451
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,700
Like, what's the kind of like mental model that you have?

1452
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,200
Because since you are doing lots of different activities and like like

1453
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,400
the other day, I saw you take a walk.

1454
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,500
I'm gonna take a walk because I have to think about some game stuff.

1455
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,000
Yeah.

1456
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,100
So what does that mental for me?

1457
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,900
There are and modes, and they're not.

1458
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,700
Again there was no very solid barrier between them, but there's a

1459
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,800
Continuum and so

1460
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,800
Ying is toward one end of the spectrum once you're experienced right?

1461
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Which is when your experience,

1462
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
Want to make a game happen again.

1463
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,700
You, you know, how to type a reasonable approximation to the answer to

1464
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,200
almost any problem that you're really going to have, okay?

1465
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,200
You don't have to sit down and figure out the architecture of how I'm

1466
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
going to, I don't know.

1467
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,600
Let's take something like, how, I'm how am I going to do Collision

1468
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,800
detection in this game?

1469
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,500
At least to a first approximation?

1470
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,100
You don't need to spend a week.

1471
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,800
It's like I don't really care.

1472
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,300
Like, if I was writing it from scratch, you would just be like okay

1473
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,400
top level.

1474
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,800
There's going to be a quadtree or Grid or something.

1475
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,800
Right?

1476
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,300
And then you do a query for who's nearby, and then you do some kind of

1477
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,700
triangle triangle and maybe later, you insert more, accelerants in

1478
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,300
there, whatever.

1479
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:40,100
It's not.

1480
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,200
Who cares?

1481
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,600
I can write something, it will work until it needs modification,

1482
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:45,600
right?

1483
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,200
And that's mostly the experience talking there where it's like, I know

1484
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,300
what these systems are look like.

1485
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,500
So, I know I can just sort of fudge one in temperature and and that is

1486
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:59,200
99.9% of programming time and okay, some point.

1487
01:03:59,300 --> 01:03:59,600
Okay.

1488
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,600
Part of that is again because our languages and tools are not that

1489
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,000
good if with really good languages and tools, we could maybe knock a

1490
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,500
half a 9 so we could get it down to 99.5.

1491
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,000
Our is that your goal with Jay?

1492
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,800
I may be okay, but 9:30, we're j.i.

1493
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,500
has half a knife and abilities.

1494
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:24,300
Yeah, but, you know, I that's just a thing.

1495
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:29,000
Like experienced programmers can make stuff happen and then even, you

1496
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,800
know, even if your

1497
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,600
Amaizing.

1498
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,900
You're not working most of the time so it's a two-step thing.

1499
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,600
See, what's happening?

1500
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,300
Yep.

1501
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,800
And then usually, what's happening these days is like I'm missing the

1502
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,000
cash all the time and you just know how to approach that, okay?

1503
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,400
So maybe the details of how you approach it vary a little bit but you

1504
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,200
don't, you don't have to, I don't know.

1505
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,300
The more of a serious of an optimization it is.

1506
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,200
Then the more you have to go figure it out, right?

1507
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:54,500
Yeah.

1508
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,800
So that's why there's a Continuum right now.

1509
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,000
On the design side.

1510
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,300
I don't want to be doing that is design, right?

1511
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,300
I don't want to make a MOBA that suggests like Dota 2.

1512
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,700
But you know, I don't like the way razors thing goes out and then

1513
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,600
comes right back in.

1514
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:18,300
I wanted to stay out for a while, whatever, ambitious design, ya know

1515
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,300
which is just to say that in design.

1516
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:20,900
If your

1517
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,800
The reason we repeat ourselves conceptually in programming is because

1518
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,600
we have to because code reuse is not really as much of a thing as we

1519
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,400
wish it was.

1520
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,100
If code reuse actually worked, the way it was supposed to.

1521
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,600
We would always be solving bigger and ever bigger, more ambitious

1522
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,200
problems, and our knowledge from the past would not apply so.

1523
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,400
Well right instead, it applies tremendously well, right with design, I

1524
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,100
try to make things at least that are new and that my understanding of

1525
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,200
a designer does not kick out an answer.

1526
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,700
Answer to everything immediately.

1527
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah.

1528
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,000
If it does, it bothers me and it makes me think like, oh, I'm not

1529
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:57,900
working that hard.

1530
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
So it's kind of very different from the programming side.

1531
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,800
And so what has to happen, right?

1532
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:06,200
Is the magical thing where you're in a shower or in bed, you wake up

1533
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,800
the next day and you just have the idea.

1534
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
The magical shower.

1535
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:15,200
Yes, you're in the magical shower, that sprinkles know or or just, you

1536
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,700
know, or I've been designing for a while and I'm stuck on something

1537
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:23,100
and I go program for two weeks and then I come back and I know the

1538
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:23,700
answer, right?

1539
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:28,100
So there's there's this very subconscious processing.

1540
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,800
If you're going to take that model,

1541
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,500
Of things.

1542
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,200
I don't.

1543
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,000
If you look at ideas of what the brain is all through history, it's

1544
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,100
always analogous to the most technologically sophisticated thing of

1545
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:40,600
the time.

1546
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:40,900
Oh, really.

1547
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,900
So now, it's like, the brains a computer.

1548
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,100
Right in the early 1900's, it was the brain is like, a very

1549
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,000
complicated telephone switchboard.

1550
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,500
Oh, really?

1551
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,100
Yeah.

1552
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,400
And then you can trace back.

1553
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:51,800
Yeah.

1554
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,500
So, but to take that analogy, right?

1555
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,500
That is much more important for me in design than it is in

1556
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,900
programming, simply because I don't need it in programming, almost out

1557
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:01,200
of that if I needed it.

1558
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:06,600
Then I probably go take a walk so to hear out calm and make this line

1559
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,900
not intersect itself but that's just stupid right?

1560
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,300
Like?

1561
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,600
Yeah.

1562
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,300
Okay.

1563
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,600
So, I mean, it sort of sounds like what you're saying there is that,

1564
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,700
like, the mindsets almost completely different.

1565
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,500
It sort of sounds like, with approach, recording problems, and

1566
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,900
president promised, to some degree.

1567
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:27,200
But with the design thing, there's, you know, so, okay, this high

1568
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,800
level idea has just appeared to me as out of this new handle ideas of

1569
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,400
In the basement.

1570
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,400
Yes, exactly.

1571
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,800
And then, for this particular game, for example, in the witness,

1572
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,000
there's a lot of instances of puzzles, right?

1573
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,800
Yeah, sometimes I'm just messing around with an idea to see what

1574
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,200
happens.

1575
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,700
To find a bottom up things.

1576
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,500
Yeah, and like, oh, this kind of makes an interesting puzzle.

1577
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:53,300
Let me the top down thing says, oh, that looks interesting.

1578
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:53,800
Okay.

1579
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,700
And then let's drive it.

1580
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,800
Bottom up a little more, sometimes.

1581
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,100
It's like sometimes I really do get a little more top down because I

1582
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:02,900
feel like

1583
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,000
We're trying to build a thing that touches all these points in this

1584
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,800
idea space.

1585
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:12,100
This one is missing or it doesn't have very many think we need to fill

1586
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,899
that and that's a very unhappy time because it means I have to be a

1587
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:18,500
lot like a computer, okay.

1588
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,600
And I have to start iterating on different like, okay, I want this

1589
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,899
particular idea in the game.

1590
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,600
It has to be in the game.

1591
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:26,399
That puzzle doesn't do it.

1592
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,399
That puzzle is to do it.

1593
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:28,399
Oh this does.

1594
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,100
And then I wake up in the next morning without the preconceptions of

1595
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,800
how to solve it.

1596
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,399
And I saw that trivially a different way that

1597
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,399
Makes the puzzle and I'm like damn it, okay?

1598
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,300
Right and so there is a very, very much more iterative.

1599
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,700
I'm just trying a bunch of stuff mode.

1600
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,300
Which is not the same as the bottom of design mode, but it's a

1601
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,100
different bottom of.

1602
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,800
This is why I don't like to say, top down bottom.

1603
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,399
So it is, it is a Top Line, bottom.

1604
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,399
You have the space and you've got a number of different sort of things

1605
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:56,200
that you're talking about there.

1606
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,700
But it's like you have a particular point in the space that you're

1607
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,800
driving towards and

1608
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,300
So as opposed to just a more free exploration where I'm just going

1609
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,300
like, oh I'm seeing what sort of happens as I try these different

1610
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,200
things out here.

1611
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,399
It's like I'm actually evaluating each one by a different metric.

1612
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,500
Not the general game metric of, is this good for my stated goals

1613
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:14,899
mortis?

1614
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:16,700
Like, am I getting closer to point x?

1615
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,600
Like do I think this is kind of getting in that very nice eventually,

1616
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,399
I kind of get in there and say, yes, I finally found the puzzle that

1617
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,200
satisfies these criteria that, you know, it has to sort of fit in

1618
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:25,700
this, in this area.

1619
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:26,800
Totally.

1620
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So let's see.

1621
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,300
Do we have?

1622
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,399
What do we have?

1623
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,000
Nope, we are

1624
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,500
we are, we are out of time.

1625
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,800
We are officially out of time.

1626
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,399
I believe we hardly got to any of your questions.

1627
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,500
No, we got two tons of my questions, right?

1628
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,700
I mean, the thing I had to skip, was Jay questions, basically.

1629
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:44,100
But I feel like that is something that we could easily handle.

1630
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:48,399
The next handmade con after AI is used throughout all of Industry.

1631
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,899
If it's happening next year, that may be a little early for, that's

1632
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:53,899
what I feel like.

1633
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:57,300
It'll be government certified somewhere around the summer after you

1634
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,700
kind of get it out there and then it'll be space shuttles.

1635
01:09:59,700 --> 01:09:59,800
And

1636
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,700
And so on.

1637
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,200
All right.

1638
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,400
But so as a final Closing one, so I guess I can't really ask the

1639
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,300
question that I was asking which is what if the other people which is

1640
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,800
what are you working on at the moment because I think everyone kind of

1641
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,200
knows so just say how are you doing?

1642
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,200
How are you holding up?

1643
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,300
You get you doing okay?

1644
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,700
Because it must be a very stressful time.

1645
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,600
I'm actually pretty happy right now.

1646
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,900
I mean it's one of those things where the worst that could happen is

1647
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:28,600
we miss our ship date by a little bit which is not great but

1648
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,800
All that means is a lot of Gamers on the internet.

1649
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,300
Feeling entitled to tell me.

1650
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,200
I'm a terrible developer because I obviously you know, I don't think

1651
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:39,500
we will.

1652
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:45,400
I think we'll be on time, but it depends but it's a very on a small

1653
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,200
team, right?

1654
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,600
You have to make everything happen.

1655
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah.

1656
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,900
And there's a bell curve of how much you think has to happen and it's

1657
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,200
heavily weighted toward the right.

1658
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,400
So the to do list get longer and longer and longer and longer and

1659
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,200
longer and longer and longer term, really.

1660
01:10:59,300 --> 01:10:59,800
Time.

1661
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:00,100
Yeah.

1662
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,200
Again because all these problems are fractal and you keep getting new

1663
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:03,800
things.

1664
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,900
And at some point like you remember, like maybe two years ago two and

1665
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,500
a half years ago, I was in a really bad mood all the time.

1666
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,000
Yes.

1667
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,300
Because it was near the top of that curve and there was like no end in

1668
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,000
sight, right?

1669
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
It's like I can't even see.

1670
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,300
I mean obviously the games more done than ever before but like the

1671
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,900
there's just too much to do and my brain can't understand all the

1672
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:27,800
things there are to do.

1673
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,100
And now it's like okay, there's a

1674
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,900
A lot of things to do in a short period of time and I wish we had more

1675
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,700
time and but that's a very finite tractable, kind of continuing to do

1676
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:41,900
just that just, you know, I just like like we just work.

1677
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,300
Casey came down to San Francisco.

1678
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,900
Actually, he worked on the Collision system for the witness and he

1679
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,400
flew down for about a week and we just cranked I don't know how many

1680
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,600
our did we pulled 14 hour days or something.

1681
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:58,400
Approximately remember yeah for a week and like you just do that and

1682
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,100
problems go away.

1683
01:11:59,300 --> 01:11:59,900
Way right.

1684
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:01,000
And no.

1685
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,400
But I mean that sounds funny but that doesn't work in the middle of

1686
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:04,900
development.

1687
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,100
No because that adds problems in the middle, right.

1688
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,600
You work a 14-hour day and now your to-do list is 10 percent longer

1689
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,300
than it was at the end of the day and that's the demoralizing part.

1690
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:18,700
So now I'm actually a good job.

1691
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,800
Well thank you very much for talking with us and soon pleasure.
