00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,200
The show, we could a complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,100
I yesterday stream, I did the math for our projection Matrix is

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:19,200
handling of the near and far clipping planes, but I forgot about the /

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Z when I did it.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,300
And then we had to really quickly redo it.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
When somebody asks a question actually, charlock asked a question and

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,600
it was like, so it's nonlinear, then I was like, no, no, it's just

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,200
Lydia and I was like no it's actually it's not like oh wait I forgot

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,300
about the divided by Z.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,000
That's bad.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,300
And then we resolve it really quickly but we didn't have a chance to

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,700
get it working.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,400
So I gotta go in there and I got to actually finish.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,900
Making it work with the correct way of understanding the correct

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,200
expectation of what open jails going to do with that Matrix.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,600
Once it gets its hands on it whereas right now.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah, well I guess or before we did this we had

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,500
sort of forgotten.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,800
The fact that open Joe was going to want to divide

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:14,400
All right, I guess now that I look at it, this is probably Kim

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Jorgensen, right in the chat with saying, hey, the new clip place up

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,700
to a negative number.

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,500
Is that a bug?

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,000
It is, I don't know when that happened.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It may be that.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
That's our only bug, I don't know.

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,400
Actually, that certainly could be.

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,100
The fact we may have other bugs, we kind of have to take a look at the

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,900
at the routines.

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
Here to see what's going on.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,800
So let's go ahead and and do that.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah, let's go ahead and just see what happens with that.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
It may be that we're working.

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Okay, but we got to test our.

36
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,800
We also have to test this routine.

37
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,400
I feel like I would feel more comfortable.

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
In fact, you know what, I can do that right now.

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
I'd like to be able to push some points through it and just see how

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
they come out.

41
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,300
So for example, you know, just make a test result here where I can

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,200
multiply a vector times The Matrix and see what the result is that

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,700
comes out.

44
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,800
So for example, Maybe,

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,800
I can put in the near clipping plane and then I can put in the far

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
clipping plane and verify.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,400
That those two things come out to be what we want them to be, which is

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,800
to say they should come out with the w component and the W component

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,300
and the and the Z components being equal to, you know, the Z

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,600
component.

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Equal to negative W component and positive the W component

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,600
respectively and

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,600
I guess the only question is we can't see in that multiplication.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,000
What happens to the W coordinate in any real way?

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Because we don't have we don't actually return the W coordinate.

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
So it's a little hard to say.

57
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,500
but, you know,

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,100
We can assume that the W, coordinate is pretty clear what it would

59
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,200
because it's only a negative one there that's going to be affecting

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,300
it.

61
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
So we can assume that it's just the input Z.

62
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,500
It's just, you know, it's just - and I'm sorry it's just N - n and - F

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,300
right because it's the only thing that comes in.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,300
So we kind of want to see if when we put these things in.

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,300
We get those those values.

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,700
Let's find out.

67
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,200
And thinking it through, too.

68
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,300
Yeah, well I won't say anything further.

69
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,200
Let's just take a look.

70
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,800
so in our math routines, where our math routines,

71
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,500
I guess they're not loaded for some reason.

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,300
That's all right.

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
We'll just set a breakpoint.

74
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,000
There manually

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,500
By the function name.

76
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,600
So going in here.

77
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,600
Here's us creating the Matrix and let's take a look at we get when we

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,399
do these tests multiplications.

79
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,300
So here's test 0, here's test one and let's see what's coming out of

80
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,800
those.

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:30,000
So in this case, it test 0 is coming out to be negative 1 and test.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,100
One is coming out to be negative 3.

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,200
Those are not useful values at all.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,900
So it looks like that does not seem correct to me at all, because

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:49,000
we're passing in a an n and an F there where it feels like those

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
should be those should be coming out much more sanely, right?

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Because first of all, one of them should be positive and one of them

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,600
should be - as just a

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,500
Start, right?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,300
Because we know that the, the near clipping plane and the far, cut

91
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,000
painter supposed to map to opposite sides right there.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,900
So it's math, the negative 1 and 1.

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
And so, the fact that these two values are coming out

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,100
You know.

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Are coming out with the same sign is not good because the sign of the

96
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,600
W coordinate in both cases, is - what that means is.

97
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Then when this when this divides, right, when we get Z and W dividing

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,800
each other here, we're going to get correctly.

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,300
In this case, we're going to get one, I'm sorry, the incorrectly, in

100
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
this case, we're going to get one.

101
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,000
So we've got the right magnitude but the wrong sign, so this Z value

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,200
should have been positive.

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,900
When we do this one negative 3 over negative 3, that one will give us

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,200
the right result, which is 1.

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,800
So

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Possible that we got a correct equation for r z for the far clipping

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,900
plane, but it doesn't look like we got the correct equation here for

108
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,300
the near clipping plane because you know, something about the way that

109
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,800
we did it.

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,100
We missed a sign somewhere as I'm often want to do when I'm working

111
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,700
through math.

112
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
This is in fact why I've always wanted a good computer algebra system

113
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,000
because most of the time, the reason I don't do,

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,600
Do more math all the time.

115
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,100
It's just because it's so frustrating to try and make sure you don't

116
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,200
make a mistake somewhere.

117
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,300
And these are mistakes that a computer, wouldn't make.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,600
But anyway, so here we go.

119
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's take a look at what's going on here and just make sure we've got

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,300
things relatively sane.

121
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,400
What I did was I said that here is the value that were looking at,

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,700
right?

123
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,800
AZ plus b, and we know that it's going to get / - Z at the end of it.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Because that's what we're putting into the W coordinate.

125
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,500
So we know that we want f of negative n to equal negative 1 and f of

126
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,800
negative.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,200
F 2 equal 1, when whatever, we set these two things too.

128
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,900
And so then we tried to do sort of a solve for what F of Z would be

129
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,400
assuming that we're going to pre divide through by negative Z.

130
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:24,900
Right?

131
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,100
So if we pre divide through by negative Z, the Z's cancel, and here,

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,400
we're just left with a negative a.

133
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,200
And then here, we're left with a negative B over Z.

134
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,700
So that does look like the correct equation to me as far as I can

135
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,000
tell.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
That that seems like a reasonable simplification of this.

137
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,400
I don't see any error in that.

138
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Unless I'm missing something about the way this is working, but I'm

139
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,900
pretty sure that that is how opengl will do.

140
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,400
It will divide by Z.

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,800
I don't think it will divide by negative Z, so it's going to /, but

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm sorry it will divide by negative Z.

143
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,500
I don't think it's going to divide by Z because it will / W not - w.

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,400
And we're putting negative Z into the W coordinate.

145
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
So then we came down here to solve it.

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,500
We said f of negative n equals negative 1 and so the negative one is

147
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,200
the result.

148
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,300
That's what the function evaluates to the negative.

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,000
N is the parameter which goes in the place of the Z.

150
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,600
We end up with negative 8 because that term is on touch.

151
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,100
We end up with positive B Over N because the negative n cancels the

152
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,900
negative here.

153
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,299
Right.

154
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,400
So then we solve for a we essentially move - A to this side which

155
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,000
becomes a and negative one to the other side which becomes one and we

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,200
have a equals 1 plus BN and that is the term that we use to substitute

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
back in to the existing equation.

158
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,900
Again, did not see a bug there, doesn't mean there isn't one.

159
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,800
I just didn't see.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,300
It.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,000
So then we come over here and we get the same kind of thing but for B.

162
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,300
So we have a negative f, I'm sorry, not for be, I shouldn't say, but

163
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,600
for were using this equation, we have the same equation.

164
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,700
We have a one, that's what it equals.

165
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,500
We have the negative 8 because that term is untouched from here.

166
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,000
And then we have a positive B over F because the negative B over Z

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
when we plug in negative f, the negatives cancel.

168
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,800
We just get the

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
A / f solving that equation.

170
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,200
We have to go ahead and substitute in the - a term here for what we

171
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,900
actually solve for.

172
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,200
We sell for a equals 1 plus b Over N.

173
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,100
So, we have negative 1 plus b over n and we retain the plus b over F

174
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,000
term, we then distributed the negative to get negative 1, negative B

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Over N plus b over F.

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,700
Like so and then we transferred the negative one to the other side.

177
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,200
Giving us a to we

178
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:10,100
And had negative B over n and B over F.

179
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,500
Right, we it so be over F.

180
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,100
Comes here B Over, N comes here.

181
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,800
So it's 1 - the other, and then we multiplied, we cross multiplied to

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,700
make the denominator be the same to make the denominator B and F

183
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,600
right?

184
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Or f.

185
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,200
N.

186
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
So the B term,

187
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,200
Here picks up a pen.

188
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,200
The B term here, picks up an f and that is correct.

189
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,900
It is it is the bn.trek because BF is the negative term and BN is the

190
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,800
positive term.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,800
So that leaves us with a b and minus F over F times, n equals 2

192
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:59,200
Right at that point we need to divide through to solve for b.

193
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,000
We end up with 2 FN because that comes out to the numerator and minus

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,100
F goes to the denominator and we end up with b equals to f n Over.

195
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,400
N minus F again, that looks pretty solid to me.

196
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
I don't see the bug there.

197
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,800
And if I don't see the bug there, I'm not going to see the any bugs

198
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,100
here, probably because this is this and this work together, so it

199
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
would probably be very difficult.

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,400
To have a sign bug only in this one but I guess you never know.

201
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
So we'll keep going.

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,600
So there's our, you know, our to f n Over.

203
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,900
N minus F, we then have to plug that in right to the be to solve for

204
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,400
a.

205
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,000
And we come through here, we know that a equals 1 plus b Over N.

206
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,300
So in this case, we have 1 plus b Over N.

207
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
That means that n is going to

208
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
multiply the denominator of this expression when we plug it in.

209
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,800
So we will have to FN

210
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,100
- NF, right?

211
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,300
So it's 1 plus 2 FN and yeah.

212
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,500
That's what we would expect.

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
So that all looks reasonable to me.

214
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,000
But now that I'm looking over here, why do we have

215
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,600
These Look Backwards.

216
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,300
Did we label these incorrectly?

217
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
These are the non perspective corrected terms.

218
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,000
It says for orthographic and we've got

219
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,400
these two terms in here, but these are the perspective terms.

220
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
And the ones that say these are the perfect of correct.

221
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
Terms are not the perspective.

222
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,100
Correct terms at all.

223
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,100
I must have done a cut and paste error there because that actually

224
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,900
should be this.

225
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,500
So This is actually what we should have been doing for our Matrix,

226
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,300
let's just check that again because that's that's what's supposed to

227
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,800
be there.

228
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
And we'll see what we get when we multiply through now.

229
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,900
Because this is what we actually would expect.

230
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,200
So let's take a look at these.

231
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,000
We have n and we have F.

232
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,900
So test 0 is are near clipping plane.

233
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,700
Z is negative, three W is negative 3, so that divides out to one and

234
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,500
we've got again exactly the same problem, which is pretty weird.

235
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,100
Like we're so we've got two totally different equations and they both

236
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,500
end up producing the exact same result.

237
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:08,600
In terms of, in terms of the final divided value which makes like very

238
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,100
little sense to me to say the least.

239
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,800
Like I am correct in thinking that that actually

240
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,800
did what it was supposed to do, right?

241
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah.

242
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,100
So these are basically functionally equivalent in terms of the

243
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,700
mapping, even with the / Z which makes no sense to me whatsoever.

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,400
I mean that is just strange, right?

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Because that sort of is we derived these two equations right thinking

246
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
that the / Z wouldn't occur.

247
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,600
And so when we did The Matrix math for those, we were assuming that

248
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,600
the Z value itself should come out to when we plug in the near and far

249
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,800
clipping plane, we were assuming that the Z value itself.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,300
Would come out to be negative 1 and 1.

251
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,800
Here it comes out to negative 1 and negative 3 right, which is totally

252
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,400
wrong.

253
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,100
And so I'm kind of at a loss to figure out what exactly where we just

254
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,300
doing absolutely horrible math.

255
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:52,400
Like, did we just make absolutely awful mistakes yesterday or am I

256
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,600
like am I totally losing my brain here?

257
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,600
When we look at this, right, let's see what these terms are.

258
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Just figure this out here.

259
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,500
So here's D and here's e.

260
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,600
That's what they that's what they equal the moment, right.

261
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,400
And with with that d and e, we would expect like it to be evaluating

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
this equation.

263
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:31,500
We would expect D times n, plus e and we would expect d x f + e and

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,100
there you go.

265
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,200
And so our Matrix is Computing, what we would expect given those two

266
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,600
terms but they're nothing like what

267
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,300
We want them to be right.

268
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,300
So that's pretty bizarre and I would also like to know why.

269
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,000
So let's see what's going on there.

270
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,900
If there's I'm going to start because I'd like to know completely

271
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,300
what's going on here, not just what's wrong with the perspective?

272
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,400
Correct ones.

273
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,599
I would like to know the perspective, the non perspective corrected

274
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,000
ones, I'd like to know why those aren't working either.

275
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
So here's what we typed in, right?

276
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,800
And let's just verify that it's what we were expected because we did

277
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,900
this math outright.

278
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,800
We said, yeah, here we go.

279
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,599
So we did all this this math here, based on those equations.

280
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,600
And we came up with what we typed in here, which is that the D value

281
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
is 2.

282
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
Over N minus f.

283
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,700
Right.

284
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
And the E value.

285
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,600
Is n + f.

286
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,000
And - F.

287
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,800
And looking at those two, we can, we should be able to also verify

288
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:58,900
that.

289
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
That's actually what we said.

290
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,700
Should be here.

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
There's the two of her, n+ F, right?

292
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,300
And there's the the B value.

293
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,500
Ah, - 1 - 2 F / n + f.

294
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,900
So did we simplify that down?

295
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh, we did.

296
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,900
This was an erroneous calculation, right?

297
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,800
Because I remember that being erroneous so here, okay?

298
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,200
So here we go to around myself and plus F Over.

299
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,800
N minus F.

300
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,600
So when we solve the, we celebrate here and plus F Over N.

301
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Minus F, there we go.

302
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,700
So, that solution was up here.

303
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,100
This is where we worked it out to Over.

304
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,200
N, minus FN plus F Over N, minus F, right?

305
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,900
And that is, that is what we've got there.

306
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,700
Yeah.

307
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Okay.

308
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,100
So, here are the two values that were actually using.

309
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,400
And in this case, we know we've got d.

310
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Z + e is the equation.

311
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,100
That we're trying to compute and now, we've taken opengl out of this.

312
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
We're just looking at our own Matrix multiply and we did it here as

313
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,900
well.

314
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,000
So even if we've got a misconception about what opengl does and we

315
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
could write

316
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,900
Like these could just be the totally wrong equations to even be

317
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,100
writing and that's fine but that's a separate part of the debugging.

318
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Right now our math is not even doing what we expected it to do even

319
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,700
just in our own code.

320
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,000
So that's an easier thing to debug and we I'm just going to go ahead

321
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,500
and look at that first just to clarify about what I'm thinking about

322
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,300
incorrectly here, right?

323
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Which is to help partition the problem into pieces.

324
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,400
I can break down.

325
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,900
So here's my FZ.

326
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:13,000
DZ plus e and here are those terms so that means that F of Z should

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,300
equal 2 over n.

328
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,600
Minus F times Z, right?

329
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,100
Plus

330
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,400
N + f.

331
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,900
And minus F.

332
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,000
That's what I should be Computing.

333
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,600
I can simplify that Z down.

334
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,900
Because in this case, these two numerators denominators are the same,

335
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,700
so that's just 2 Z + n+ f.

336
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,800
Oops.

337
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,800
And plus f.

338
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,000
Over n- f.

339
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,000
Right?

340
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,300
And that's the entirety of the equation that we're looking at.

341
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
We're just saying,

342
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,900
2z.

343
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,400
+ + + f / and - F, oops.

344
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
And myself.

345
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,700
That's it.

346
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,000
So now, if I plug in the two values that I'm interested in, if I say f

347
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,000
of negative n, what does it equal, right?

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,500
I would get its -2 n plus n plus F Over N.

349
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,200
Minus f

350
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:40,400
Yes, and if I look at what that equals, that's f of negative n equals.

351
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
- n + f / n minus f.

352
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,200
which,

353
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,800
If I pull out the negative here is, n minus F, right?

354
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Because that is f minus n.

355
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
So the negative of that is n minus F Over N, minus f.

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,200
F of negative, n should have equal negative 1.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,700
Ah,

358
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,100
that is what I did erroneously.

359
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I was going to say I'm clearly missing something here because we can't

360
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
be wrong about all of this all the time.

361
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,400
All right.

362
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,900
So now let's see if these come out correctly.

363
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,500
So here's my test 0.

364
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,100
So Z over W in this case would equal 1.

365
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Which again not is not right though because the near clipping plane

366
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
should be mapped to negative 1.

367
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,900
If I remember correctly, that's what we said we wanted and then our f

368
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,600
is also 1.

369
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,400
So then - n

370
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Didn't help.

371
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,500
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,200
The - n- F didn't help.

373
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
In this case, which I guess makes sense.

374
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:10,300
Because hey, if you pass in the - in this case I suppose if we negate

375
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,700
both of them we wouldn't necessarily expect the sign to do what it

376
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,100
did.

377
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,100
Anyway.

378
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,000
So yeah, Z / dub and I guess I should say in this case.

379
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
Oh nope, I'm wrong.

380
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,400
We're testing the non perspective corrected case so we don't divide.

381
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,800
So this is correct.

382
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Z is negative.

383
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,900
One, we ignore the W because we're testing this Branch the negative 1

384
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
to 1 is the mapping we wanted.

385
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,200
Okay, shoot good?

386
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,700
Good, good.

387
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,300
So those equations I think are right there just not the equations we

388
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,800
needed because we need the perspective version of them.

389
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,400
Now, let's take a look at these equations, when using the - properly

390
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,000
and see what they produce, whether we get what we want there.

391
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,700
So if I take a look at test 0, I have - - so this divides out to be

392
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,800
one again, that

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,800
I wanted.

394
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,800
And then test one.

395
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,700
Also, divides out to be one as well.

396
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:15,600
So we don't this equation, seems busted this equation seems to be

397
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,700
working properly.

398
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,600
So it looks like we're going to have to figure out where we've gone

399
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,200
wrong.

400
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,200
In our understanding of this, I will go ahead and re substitute those

401
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
back in there.

402
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,600
But at least now we're actually we verified that this is correct and

403
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,000
working.

404
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,100
We just don't actually want to do an orthographic projection here.

405
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,100
So that makes it less useful.

406
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,800
All right,

407
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,600
So let's go ahead and work the other one through.

408
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,100
What did I write down here?

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
so, in this case, we've got

410
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,300
A d and e.

411
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,300
We're looking at the top branch.

412
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:11,500
So in this case, our D value equals 1 plus 2 f n over.

413
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,300
N n- f.

414
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:26,600
Well, I'll be honest, is there a reason that we didn't cross the ends

415
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,400
out of this?

416
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,300
Like that's actually that's weird that we didn't do that because this

417
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,900
is just n.

418
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,600
Minus F Over.

419
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,800
N minus f plus 2 F Over N minus F, right?

420
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,100
Which is actually a much simpler term that's n- F + 2.

421
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,100
F Over N.

422
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,900
Minus f.

423
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,600
Right?

424
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,600
I mean, did I did I was a hasty there, but that's that's a, that's a

425
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,700
crap value.

426
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Look at what that turns out to be right?

427
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
That's n- F Over N.

428
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,600
Minus f.

429
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,100
Which is just 1.

430
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,500
I mean, there's no way.

431
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,200
That's right because it doesn't do anything.

432
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,300
Right.

433
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,000
There's no point to that.

434
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,600
It doesn't correct for anything.

435
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,300
So we know we must have a signed bug in that term.

436
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,100
Like, that's gotta be wrong.

437
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,900
So I just checked our derivation.

438
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,500
Obviously, I'm just as bad at math, as I say that I am because we

439
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
looked at this and decided that it was still working correctly, but

440
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,300
that can't be right.

441
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,200
That just can't be right.

442
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,700
Because yeah, look I mean there it is and that's just totally

443
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,000
That's just totally nuts.

444
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,600
It even looks like we started to simplify it and then like we must it

445
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,900
must have been because I was doing this in a hurry like look at this,

446
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,600
we started to simplify it and then must have concluded.

447
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,900
We couldn't even though it's obviously simplify able, I mean, the ends

448
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
cross even right there, you can see that even if you didn't pick it up

449
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,300
here, that's just dumb.

450
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,600
So this is like yeah this is, this is some questionable Mass

451
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,600
situations Happening Here If we're honest, just not real good.

452
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
Yeah, Highly Questionable.

453
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,800
So let's take a look at what's going on.

454
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,700
They're not sure exactly what's happening with that.

455
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
So let's let's just take one more.

456
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,900
Look, real real close there.

457
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,600
We've got the - a - b / Z thing happening.

458
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,100
Here, we we solved for a and again that looks pretty solid.

459
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
Because that would be negative one.

460
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,500
Plus it would be, it would be be over, I'm sorry.

461
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
It would be -1 + a on this side.

462
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,700
If we moved it over, which would mean that we move the negative, or we

463
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,300
have B Over N plus 1, which is what we have.

464
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,000
And so that's just what we would plug into the other side which we

465
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,500
did.

466
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,200
And yeah.

467
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,700
So if we look here and we say that in this case, be equals to f n

468
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,000
Over.

469
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,200
N minus f

470
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,000
Curious, let's take one more.

471
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,600
Look at this.

472
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,400
So, if we look at this, we've got one equals negative one, So that

473
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,300
obviously becomes to.

474
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,100
That's right.

475
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,900
- BN + BF, that's going to be negative b.

476
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,000
F, plus BN on the top.

477
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,600
So that's what we have here as well.

478
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,100
Which

479
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,400
let me just go ahead and do that out.

480
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,100
So one equals negative 1 negative B Over N plus BF.

481
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,200
That's two equals negative B n + BF, right?

482
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
That's 2 equals negative B.

483
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,500
F and f plus BN.

484
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,200
Oops.

485
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,300
And F or two equals.

486
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Bien.

487
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,600
- BF over NF.

488
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,100
Pulling out the b, you get B and minus F over NF.

489
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:19,900
Oops,

490
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,200
Which does appear to solve for 2nf Over N minus F.

491
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
So that b does.

492
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,000
I don't know.

493
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,500
That looks pretty solid.

494
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Just not sure where we're making the bug here.

495
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,200
We know we must be because we're getting it wrong.

496
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,800
So let's substitute, well, I guess we can't even suspecting because

497
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
this we know this term is garbage.

498
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,300
We know the a term is is garbage, right?

499
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
so, when we substitute that back in,

500
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
B over n.

501
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,700
We got the to f n and minus f.

502
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,000
And that's divided by n on this side.

503
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,700
Make sure I'm doing that right.

504
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,000
OnePlus 2 FN.

505
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:41,000
And minus F that's crust ends.

506
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,600
And - F.

507
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:51,700
Over N minus f plus 2 F Over N minus f.

508
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,800
Okay so wait did I get overzealous?

509
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,700
There we may be at least slightly, okay?

510
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,600
And - F + 2 F Over N minus F.

511
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,000
That's actually just

512
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,800
And plus f.

513
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
Can't find enough of the math here.

514
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,000
Here we go.

515
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,200
So that may just been me being overzealous, maybe my checking of the

516
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,200
math was bad.

517
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,800
So what did I do?

518
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,600
I said,

519
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,900
So here's where we were doing that before 1 plus 2 FN NN minus F.

520
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,700
I said it was n- f n- f + 2.

521
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,400
F over M.

522
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:16,700
SF.

523
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,600
That's right.

524
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:23,800
Then I said that was n- F + 2 F and then somehow I said that was this,

525
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,400
but this was just wrong.

526
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
So okay, I'm less nervous about that now.

527
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,600
Good.

528
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,500
All right, so that does mean that we can treat these like this.

529
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,900
Now, it looks like we already knew that in some weird way, right.

530
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,000
So this value on the top here is actually not.

531
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,400
We do not need to do it this complicated at all, right?

532
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,400
It's not.

533
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,400
It's just n + f Over N.

534
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,100
Minus f.

535
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,800
According to us, which makes that quite a bit simpler, unfortunately.

536
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,900
Like I saying that's still wrong.

537
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,300
As far as we know, because the math when we tested, it didn't work

538
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,900
properly.

539
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:15,300
So now, let's actually see what we get.

540
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,000
That's actually the E term for the other equation.

541
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:19,699
You look at these.

542
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,199
These are basically the same now except for the fact that we've got

543
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,300
the two in this, in the E term is now times, F times n, which was not

544
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,100
the case before.

545
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,800
That's pretty weird and the term swapped so I don't know, again, kind

546
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
of just in math, math, nasty land at this point.

547
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,400
But let's go ahead and, and take a look at those

548
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,800
So, here's the D term.

549
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:49,900
And plus f.

550
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,000
And minus F.

551
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,199
And here's the E term.

552
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,900
2fn.

553
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,400
N- F.

554
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,600
So our function, in this case.

555
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,000
Is going to be the D term times, the incoming Z value.

556
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,700
So if you're Scott Z

557
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
And plus f.

558
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,500
Over N minus F and we're adding the E term, so we can just go ahead

559
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,600
and add in the 2fn.

560
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,100
They're both on the same.

561
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
They both have the same divisor, right?

562
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,700
So, let's take a look at our F of Z term here.

563
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,000
We're going to plug in f of negative n that's are near clipping plane.

564
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,400
So if we take a look at here, we get Negative n n+ f + 2 FN

565
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,000
Over n- f f of negative, n.

566
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
- N squared - NF.

567
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,600
+2 f, n Over.

568
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,500
N minus F.

569
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,900
Looking at what happens when we keep going with that.

570
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,700
We end up with a these two terms are both f n terms.

571
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,900
Whereas, this is not that makes things a little ugly for us.

572
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,400
I'm not sure there's much, we can do about that.

573
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,600
In fact, I can pretty much tell that this is wrong.

574
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,800
Oh no.

575
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,300
No, but we also know that we will be dividing by negative Z, right to

576
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,800
get our final answer.

577
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,700
So we also know that we will be dividing here, whatever this comes out

578
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,900
to, we will be dividing by negative Z as well.

579
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,100
So we do have an extra

580
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,200
An extra end that will appear in the numerator.

581
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:04,900
So that's fine.

582
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,200
It's not as like fine.

583
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,900
But, you know, no need to panic quite yet.

584
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,300
Right?

585
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,100
Because this is our equation for the output Z value, but the Z value

586
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,900
gets / - Z

587
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,000
So then we end up with this equation.

588
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,200
If I write this part out, I get Negative squared, minus F, FN, rather

589
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
and sorry N squared minus f n.

590
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,500
So then I've got an N squared and in the top, if I combine these two

591
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,600
terms, I end up with just the positive f n.

592
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,500
So I get Negative.

593
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,500
N squared, positive FN down at the bottom.

594
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,100
I get N squared minus FN, right?

595
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,700
That's the the

596
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:48,900
The same there.

597
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,500
And so if I actually look at what this poor or what this should pull

598
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,300
out to be,

599
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,500
Pulling out a negative from this.

600
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
I end up getting negative N squared.

601
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,700
Minus f.

602
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,100
N Over N squared minus FN, which should be negative 1.

603
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,200
Right.

604
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,600
So when I plug in negative end to this, I expect I would expect to

605
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,800
have seen - one coming out of that.

606
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,600
Right.

607
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,300
That's what I would expect after the Divide.

608
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,200
But if you look at what happens here, I'm not getting that at.

609
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:30,800
All right?

610
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,200
I'm getting positive one after the Divide unless I'm misunderstanding

611
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,100
something because W is getting set to negative Z, right?

612
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
Although no, it isn't.

613
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
This is my Z value.

614
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,100
- 0 .1.

615
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,300
But it's not.

616
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Getting X that, ah, right?

617
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
That's awesome.

618
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,400
So I guess we see a reason, why not to call this uvw because this is

619
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,100
x, y, z w here.

620
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,200
If you had a formal structure, this is only three to ensure this W is

621
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,700
just this value.

622
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,900
So we never actually look at the W coordinate because it doesn't

623
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900
actually come back from this thing that's bad.

624
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:48,500
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and say that that's just not going to be.

625
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,500
Oh man, I have never had that bug before.

626
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,900
I think, as I never named that W like that before, I don't know why we

627
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,800
did that.

628
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,100
That's hilarious.

629
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
Well, that explains why we were having so much trouble with it.

630
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,300
Yeah, we're just going to call that like something that is that's not

631
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,000
there, right?

632
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,600
Because that's just, that's just real bad.

633
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,700
That's a really easy mistake for my brain to make.

634
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,600
I do not want that happening at all.

635
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,100
So basically like yeah, you don't.

636
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,600
You don't get that one.

637
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,700
Oh wait.

638
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,300
That's this.

639
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,900
One's actually.

640
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay, this one.

641
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,300
It actually is a V4, so that's fine.

642
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,200
So it's only the V3 that that's just real bad.

643
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,100
That's just really, really bad.

644
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Let's try that one more time.

645
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,700
So now when we look at this thankfully I'm not seeing that as a w

646
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,900
anymore so that way, I'll remember that.

647
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,100
That's just the UV coordinates at.

648
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,300
This is a separate way to look at this Union.

649
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,800
It's unfortunate that there's no way.

650
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Like this is one of those things where, like, I wish I could just hint

651
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,200
to the debugger in like comments that don't show it to me that way,

652
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,200
right?

653
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,200
I just want to see three values and I want to see them like x /, you

654
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,400
know, U /r or something, right?

655
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,500
I don't want to see it as if there's more because my brain will do

656
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,200
something stupid.

657
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,100
Like, it just did.

658
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,600
All right, so that's actually fine that's actually just fine.

659
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,500
That's going to be the correct value.

660
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
That's going to be negative 1, which is exactly what I wanted.

661
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,500
Let's see what this one's going to be.

662
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:48,900
This one's going to be 100 divided by negative 100, right?

663
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,000
This one's going to be negative.

664
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,900
1 divided by a negative 0.1, divided by a positive point one, which is

665
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,900
going to be negative.

666
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,400
One.

667
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,700
This one's going to be positive one.

668
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,600
Okay.

669
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,800
We're okay.

670
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,400
That actually looks reasonable, right?

671
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,100
So off we go the only thing I don't know right now.

672
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,300
And yeah, I guess this is something that that we don't necessarily

673
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,700
have to worry about at the immediate moment.

674
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
But the only thing I don't know right now.

675
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
And and this all looks correct now.

676
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,900
So we're back.

677
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
We're back in business.

678
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,400
The only thing I'm not sure about is the the direction.

679
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,100
These go.

680
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,900
We mapped the near clipping plane to negative 1 and the far clipping

681
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,800
plane to 1.

682
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,900
We're assuming that's correct through opengl because that's what we

683
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,800
could could glean from the spec.

684
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,400
But again, since we can't step into the open GL code, we don't really

685
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,500
know what they're doing.

686
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,100
And like, it could be that they want them the other way around.

687
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,400
So for now we're just going to have to assume that we got that

688
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
correct.

689
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,800
And that that's the direction they go.

690
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:17,100
And I would suspect that we did because we're using a the the Z

691
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,000
comparison function that we set up was assuming that that was the

692
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,900
correct mapping and it appears to be working

693
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,200
Although, I guess we should just to double check again that, that's

694
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,700
true.

695
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,300
I should do something in like render group to make up right stuff,

696
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,000
kind of tilt up like we were doing before, because if I if I do that

697
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,900
then we can actually see if the Z is properly doing occlusion, which

698
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,300
we don't necessarily know that it is at the moment.

699
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,400
So if I take a look at the push pop call here, I'm just going to go

700
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,800
ahead and say, you know, if entry or sorry if object transform

701
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,500
Upright, I just want to go ahead and say, okay, let's let's put the

702
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,800
y-axis sort of standing up and, and verify that that works.

703
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,800
So that that does again look like the Z buffer is working properly

704
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,200
there, and is sorting in the correct order and that's all I really

705
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
wanted to verify, right?

706
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,600
You can see if I'm looking from below, I can't see anything, that's up

707
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:22,900
higher.

708
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,600
If I'm looking from the top, I can see those slanted.

709
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,400
Is appearing in front of the ground.

710
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,700
So all of that is much happier now and that's good.

711
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:36,800
Okay.

712
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,100
Alright.

713
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,800
So that was basically a case where we actually ironically did the

714
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,900
math, right?

715
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,000
In both cases and thought we had it wrong because first, we had set

716
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,200
the near clipping plane to the wrong value which I don't know how that

717
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,800
happened.

718
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,800
That's just been a typo and then

719
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,200
And because I forgot about the fact that w, we had named W to not be

720
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,800
for the fourth dimensional.

721
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,100
Element of a V4 that case that was just a real bad idea.

722
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,800
Now I know definitively don't ever do that.

723
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,200
I've never done it before.

724
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,100
I'm not sure why we did it here.

725
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:29,400
But we did and oops, we could also call it s, I believe s.

726
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,100
And t are sometimes used for those values.

727
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,400
But for now we'll just leave it unnamed if we want to name it later,

728
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,100
we always can write.

729
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,900
We can always choose to come in here and name it something else.

730
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,100
That's not W.

731
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,400
I think up until might name them, S, and T for example, but yeah.

732
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Anyway, now that we've got that under control, quote, on quote, we

733
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,300
need to go and take a look at how we are doing our Sprites, right?

734
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,200
So if we take a look at render group here, when we are doing our push

735
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,900
bitmap, call for a Sprite, I'd like to have some idea here about how

736
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,900
we're going to

737
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,600
To make this a line with the camera or other things of that nature.

738
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,700
So what I want to do is I want to know where the camera is, obviously

739
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,700
that's important.

740
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,900
And then I want to be able to align things to the camera in a sensible

741
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,000
way and we got to have some kind of technique for doing this, right?

742
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,900
We got to have

743
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,100
Some kind of an idea about how this is going to work.

744
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,400
And so we need to take a look, let me go ahead over here and make a

745
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,900
new entry on the Blackboard for it.

746
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,600
Oops,

747
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So here's day 365, and I feel like my pain for some reason lost its

748
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,300
its Mojo there.

749
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,500
Yeah, it did.

750
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,200
so,

751
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,100
We have to think about Sprite cards now.

752
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,200
And what I, what I mean by this, we kind of talked about the end of

753
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:47,600
the stream yesterday is I want to be able to have my Sprites do what

754
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,200
it appears to be an orthographic projection, right?

755
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,100
So I want my Sprites if I want to be able to stand my Sprites so that

756
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,000
when they're looked at on the screen, you know, even if they're in the

757
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,900
corner of the screen,

758
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And they look like they're standing up rectilinear with respect to the

759
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,900
screen, you know?

760
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,400
But I want them to do that.

761
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,200
Even inside a perspective projection, we're giving them coordinates

762
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,600
that looked like that would actually have them look more like that.

763
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,200
Right.

764
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,800
And so what I'm trying to do here is say let's feed coordinates in

765
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,600
which make it appear to be at that sort of angle without it actually

766
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,400
being at that angle right?

767
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,600
So even though it's actually going through perspective transform that

768
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,200
does this two things we put in coordinates that are fake so that it

769
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,200
ends up doing that.

770
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,400
That's kind of what I would like to do.

771
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,000
So if you think about what that implies, if we look at it from the

772
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,700
side, what I'm trying to do is say, okay, here's what I've got.

773
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,600
Right?

774
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,400
And I'm looking down at the camp.

775
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,800
I'm looking down this way and so for the from the cameras perspective,

776
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,000
it's doing a transform, that's kind of making things on these slices.

777
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,000
They're looking correct.

778
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,900
If we were to make something at a particular width at this distance,

779
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:21,800
it would look correct if it was in this plane but we are actually

780
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,000
making something that's at this other plane right?

781
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,500
We want it to be this way for other reasons.

782
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,500
We want it to be this way because we're trying to make it so that it

783
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,700
can stand up in z.

784
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,100
And so, what that means is whatever I want that angle to be, and

785
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,800
that's something that obviously I can.

786
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,600
Prescribe essentially, you can imagine that I have a vector, right?

787
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,300
And that Vector is the direction along, which I am free to move this

788
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:52,900
point.

789
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,100
So, essentially, I once I fix the ground point, you know, so I say

790
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,600
that the Sprite starts at wherever it is in Z here.

791
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,400
What I then have to do is say well, okay, it's going to stretch

792
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,900
upwards and it's going to stretch upwards at this along this point for

793
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:17,900
some distance D and along that distance, I need it to go far enough

794
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:23,300
such that the projected area into this other plane.

795
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,100
Right?

796
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,100
If I was to look at it this way and I could imagine that that camera

797
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,200
playing just being a line going through.

798
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:37,300
Ground Point as well and projecting this point on to it right in that

799
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,000
plane.

800
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,400
I need it to be some other height, I need it to be H, which I am

801
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,500
specifying to be based on the bitmap, right?

802
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,800
So the bitmap is going to prescribe this.

803
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,800
I know this vector and this Vector right

804
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,800
And I just want to go as far up, as I need to to produce this age.

805
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,600
Okay.

806
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,000
And that's the first step, that's only the first step because that

807
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
won't correct this year.

808
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,200
It will produce the correct height, but it won't correct this year.

809
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,500
So if we take a look here and you look at what's happening, well

810
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,700
So this is the naive approach obviously, right?

811
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,300
It's just doing nothing particular.

812
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:36,300
So if you look at what happens here, you can see that I'm getting this

813
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,100
sort of, it's making my trees more squat.

814
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,600
It's like smashing them and so I need them to come out to the same

815
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,000
size and as you can as you if you don't know, if you remember from

816
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,800
last time, oops

817
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,900
For any given tree, right?

818
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:09,100
I can manually sort of fiddle with this value and get the I think

819
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,400
that's probably about what it is, right?

820
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,800
I don't remember exactly what the trees aspect ratio should be.

821
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,500
But we can fiddle with the value ourselves for any given Tree.

822
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,800
In this case, I'm looking at this tree right here, we can make that

823
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,400
look like the tree should look.

824
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,500
Right.

825
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,500
But the question is, how do we solve that for all trees, no matter how

826
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,100
far away they are, or anything else, right?

827
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,100
Or no matter where they are on the screen, we should be able to

828
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,000
produce that value for any tree, okay?

829
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:46,600
And in this case, you can kind of see to we're getting that part of

830
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,800
the problem there too.

831
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,600
Is that that, that Z value, whatever it is, I suppose, as we get

832
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Further.

833
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,900
I have to think about this.

834
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,600
For a camera that's tilted.

835
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,300
Or I guess even for a camera that's not tilted where that point is is

836
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,400
going to matter in terms of the projection down, right?

837
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:27,200
Because when this gets projected, it's going to get projected out from

838
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,300
the camera point.

839
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:33,400
So wherever the camera point is, it's going to get projected out onto

840
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,800
onto this Vector, right?

841
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,100
It's projecting this onto this

842
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,200
Right?

843
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:46,800
So, I believe and I could be mistaken but I believe what we

844
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,200
essentially have is we have the cameras up Vector which is the y axis

845
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,200
of the camera in this case, right?

846
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,000
So here's the camera.

847
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,400
We have some.

848
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,900
Us of the camera.

849
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,700
So that's the cameras, y-axis.

850
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,500
And then somewhere out in the world, you know, we have a point, here

851
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,200
is our ground point, right?

852
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,500
This is RPG ground.

853
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,800
We are looking at this thing.

854
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,900
We know that the cameras y-axis is the thing.

855
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,000
We're interested in down here again, so that's the cameras y-axis,

856
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,200
right?

857
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,400
And we know that we have another axis, which is whatever the card

858
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,600
accesses, whatever.

859
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,200
The like,

860
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,500
Upright accesses will call that you and we know that that upright

861
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,200
access can have as much of a distance along as we want.

862
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,600
So we can go as far along that as we want, right?

863
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,300
So that's our devalue.

864
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,000
And what we want to do is we want to pick our D value such that when

865
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,700
the camera looks at the D value.

866
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:03,200
And projected onto the Cy Vector, right?

867
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,700
We get H.

868
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,200
Does that make sense?

869
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,900
Hopefully, that makes some sense.

870
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,000
Now, we can produce a number of these things relatively easily, what's

871
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,600
this point, right?

872
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,200
Let's let's think about what these are.

873
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,100
So this point here, which is the actually the target point that we

874
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,000
want, right?

875
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,700
This is the place we actually want.

876
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,500
So we'll call that point actually P because that's just the point of

877
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,200
interest there.

878
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,000
So for that point P, we know that what we've got

879
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,400
In this case is p equals p g.

880
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,300
Oops,

881
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,000
Plus this D value X you.

882
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,900
So we're starting here, right?

883
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,300
We're going along you until we hit this P value.

884
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,100
If we want to, we can Center everything.

885
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,800
This entire thing because both of these are going to be + PG.

886
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,100
We can Center everything about PG and just get rid of the term if you

887
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,600
want to write.

888
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,000
And we probably should do that.

889
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,400
So let's take a look at this and we'll take a look at this point here.

890
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,400
In fact, maybe I'll give these all different P names.

891
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
So this will be

892
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,800
The result piece, this will be P result and this will be the p y.

893
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,700
This will be the thing that's on, CY, write the p y term.

894
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,900
That's probably bad actually, because I don't really want the Y in

895
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,000
there.

896
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,500
So let's say this is the P ground term.

897
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:43,900
Oh wait.

898
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,000
No, I already used that.

899
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,200
P projected.

900
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,500
So my projected term is going to be my pee ground term plus height.

901
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:58,900
Right.

902
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,600
Times that Cy vector.

903
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:07,300
And this is entirely known.

904
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:14,400
Write this whole thing, this, this value is known completely, right?

905
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,400
Because we know the height value, we know the Cy and we know the PG.

906
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,900
Those are all inputs.

907
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,400
So, at the moment d, right?

908
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,800
Is the only unknown right d and PR are the unknowns.

909
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,800
So we know what we're solving for, we're solving for D, in this case,

910
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and we need to work out the equation of terms of that.

911
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:34,500
Okay?

912
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,600
So how do we work out the equations in terms of that we known as the

913
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,000
Anything that we know and this is where we're going to get our thing

914
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,700
to solve from, is that the camera point, right?

915
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,800
So, this is PC, in this case camera,

916
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,300
We know we have a vector that goes from the camera through this point

917
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,900
and down towards the place that we're trying to hit.

918
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:04,800
Right, we know that we've got that point and we don't know the length

919
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,600
of this.

920
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,200
At the moment, I suppose.

921
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,100
We don't know the length of that because that's a solve, right?

922
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,100
We've got to figure out where this, these two things, hit in some

923
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,200
sense, right?

924
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,500
We've got to figure out where PP would hit.

925
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,100
Now, the interesting thing about that, if we look at it is, we don't

926
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,100
really need to know this yet because we can solve these.

927
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:41,300
Also, in reverse order, we could figure out where this Vector hits

928
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:44,500
this Vector, right, or this plane, if you will.

929
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,600
So we could do a simple

930
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,300
Ray intersects plane and we could get this point right here.

931
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,700
And once we have this point, then we know

932
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
This line as well.

933
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,100
However, since that's a projection, I don't think that really helps

934
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:05,200
us.

935
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,700
It seems like solving for this is just as good, right?

936
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,800
Yeah, so here's the way I think we want to approach this looking at

937
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,000
the diagram, some more.

938
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,000
I think we want to approach this as the intersection of these two

939
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,800
lines.

940
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,100
To get this point we know this line, because it's entirely prescribed,

941
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:30,700
right?

942
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:38,200
We know this point p p and we know this point PC, so PP minus PC,

943
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,500
right?

944
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,000
And we can even normalize that.

945
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,800
This is like the camera ray.

946
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:51,800
Right.

947
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,800
So we can actually simplify this problem down quite a bit.

948
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,800
We can just say that from the camera point.

949
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,300
we have a ray let's say let's just call that are we have a re going

950
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,600
from the camera point

951
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,100
We have another array in this case.

952
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,000
Starting from the ground Point going up.

953
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,200
We know both of these, that gives us two lines and we just want to

954
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,300
know the intersection.

955
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,100
Right, that's all we want to know.

956
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,100
So, we just want to know.

957
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,000
If we have PC.

958
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,900
If we've got PC Plus T times are we just want to know?

959
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,200
And that's so it's saying somewhere, we got PC, we're going to, in

960
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,600
fact, we've done this on a maid here before.

961
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:59,200
This is just two lines intersecting we've got PC, + t r, which is

962
01:00:59,200 --> 01:00:59,800
saying I can go.

963
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,200
As far along, this is I want, T is my free parameter of where I go on

964
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:09,500
the line, I want PC Plus TR and I want that to equal, you know, PG

965
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
plus something times you right?

966
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,700
So T called

967
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,000
Like say is time 0.

968
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,500
Right.

969
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,800
And so I want to know where these two are going to equal each other.

970
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:30,300
This is actually quite straightforward because this equation is in y

971
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:31,400
and z.

972
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,100
Right?

973
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,700
Because I've got, why is this direction?

974
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,200
I'm sorry, I've got Z.

975
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Is this direction?

976
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,700
And why is this direction?

977
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,500
So this even though it looks like only one equation in two unknowns

978
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,100
here in here is actually two equations and two unknowns because we

979
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:55,700
have X.

980
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,900
I'm sorry, we have y and z.

981
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:07,000
So all we have to do here is solve for one of them and plug it into

982
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,100
the other, and that gives us the solution that we're looking for.

983
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:16,200
so, I believe

984
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,900
I don't know that we ever generalized this.

985
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,400
I don't think we did sadly but we should.

986
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,200
Let's take a look.

987
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,400
Oh well maybe we never really did Ray versus Ray.

988
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,300
Maybe we just did the special case of it being a wall.

989
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,800
Yeah, where the walls were rectilinear.

990
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,800
All right, so that's okay.

991
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,700
That means we didn't waste any work there.

992
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,300
So let's solve this for real.

993
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,800
So what we want here is Ray intersects Ray

994
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,200
Right, that's what we're looking for here.

995
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:29,300
Now, you'll notice that in this case, these don't actually need to be

996
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,000
normalized.

997
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,500
There's nothing in this equation that suggests that these are

998
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,400
normalized values which means we don't even have to normalize our and

999
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,400
you first, we can just solve this and we will get something that no

1000
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,500
matter what these lengths of these are it will still produce the

1001
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,600
correct solution in terms of those raised, right?

1002
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,900
Which is also kind of nice.

1003
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,200
So let's go ahead and do that if we go ahead and solve this and I'm

1004
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,300
going to change these terms around here since we're going to do a

1005
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:59,000
generic Ray intersection, let's just call them A and B.

1006
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,700
Now let's make our diagram much, much more straightforward.

1007
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,800
So let's call this like PA

1008
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,000
and ra and we'll call this PB.

1009
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,700
And our B.

1010
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,700
Right.

1011
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,500
And what we're looking for is this point right here.

1012
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:29,400
And so what we're looking to do here is do ray intersection.

1013
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,000
Kind of a thing.

1014
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:39,300
We would be taking PA ra and a PBR be

1015
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,700
And we want to Output a couple things like probably a pair of values.

1016
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:51,200
That's the the tea, you know, the whatever the T value.

1017
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:55,800
So we would want this to Output like ta and TB.

1018
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:56,500
Let's say.

1019
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,600
Which are those multiplier values.

1020
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:08,900
So assuming that we have the equation PA plus T-ara equals P B+, T

1021
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:10,200
BRB.

1022
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:10,800
Oops.

1023
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,000
Assuming that, that's what we're looking for.

1024
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,400
Assuming that, that's what we're talking about.

1025
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,500
Then we should be able to

1026
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,700
We should be able to produce the TA in the TV, that tells you how far

1027
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,800
to go along each rate.

1028
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,600
To hit the point where they intersect

1029
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:43,400
So in this case, when we're looking at these values, if we take this

1030
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:49,500
and start to solve it for SATA, what we would get in this case is,

1031
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,500
let's go ahead and, and we'll split this in half.

1032
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:59,600
so let's say we solve it for ta, we would get ta

1033
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,100
Oops, I did that way.

1034
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,600
We would get T-ara equals PB minus PA

1035
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:10,700
Right.

1036
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,300
Plus T BRB

1037
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,700
And then so we want to solve again 40 a member are a is as array is

1038
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,500
actually known.

1039
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,000
So we would get ta equals p.

1040
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,500
B, minus PA plus, t b are be over.

1041
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,600
Our a, and again, you can't really unless you're doing geometric

1042
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,300
algebra, which probably we should, but whatever,

1043
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,800
You can't really divide by a vector, but that's okay because we're

1044
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,200
just pretending, these are scalar like I said, we're going to.

1045
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,900
We have two equations, one in oops, one in y and one in Z.

1046
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,700
So let's just say that we're going to do this one in y.

1047
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,500
So now we have done all of this in terms of Y.

1048
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:07,700
So all of these implicitly have a why right in them.

1049
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,900
So this is actually p bypa yra yrb.

1050
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,700
I TB is still just a scalar, right?

1051
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,800
So we have solved, TA in terms of T be, there it is.

1052
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,200
Pretty straightforward, right?

1053
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,500
So then we come over here and we just do the X version.

1054
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,300
Okay, we've got the same equation, but now we want to plug in this

1055
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,300
ridiculous.

1056
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,900
Monstrosity, 40 a.

1057
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:45,400
So we end up with PA plus PB y minus p.

1058
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,200
A, why write plus t?

1059
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,400
B?

1060
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:56,800
R Loops be y over R.

1061
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,600
A why?

1062
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,300
That's our T value?

1063
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:08,400
And all of that is times are a that in this case is going to be the

1064
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,000
X's.

1065
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,200
So everybody outside of that is going to be exes because we're going

1066
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,700
to treat this equation as a PA x + 2 ax.

1067
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:22,600
Sorry Pa X Plus ta plus r times R ax P B+, T PB x + TB R BX, right?

1068
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,000
So these are X's these were all solved in terms of Y so then we're

1069
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:26,899
equal over here.

1070
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:30,200
We've got our PBX, we've got

1071
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:40,399
Rtb and we've got our RBX now again, this we know now to be just in

1072
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,200
terms of TB so we only have one more variable.

1073
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,899
We only have one variable solve for, so we should be able to solve

1074
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:46,100
this.

1075
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,800
Even though it's a big nasty ridiculous equation with a bunch of terms

1076
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
and it doesn't matter because we know, we can solve it.

1077
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,200
We've only got one term left to solve for.

1078
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,700
So in this case, we again would say

1079
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,600
Right, let's simplify this down P.

1080
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,200
Ax.

1081
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,399
Up top here.

1082
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,500
We're going to have again.

1083
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,500
We're trying to get the kind of this out of there.

1084
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,500
In fact, I guess what we would do first is probably multiply through

1085
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,899
by ra y, so we get p ax.

1086
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:27,700
Our a y plus this term now comes out directly so it's PB y minus p, a

1087
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,800
y x, r ax.

1088
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,500
Right, that's doing that term here.

1089
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:38,399
Plus t b.

1090
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,100
RB y RX.

1091
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,700
Right, so you can see where that's happening.

1092
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,899
Right there are a wide is Multiplied.

1093
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:50,000
Through the ra y, comes out on this side as well.

1094
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:57,900
So that's PBX are a y + TB R BX.

1095
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,600
Ra y, right?

1096
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,900
And hey, now we're basically done.

1097
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:04,700
Right?

1098
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,800
There's not a whole lot more to it, we've got rtb terms and they're

1099
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:09,400
isolated.

1100
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,300
So in this case, we can combine them.

1101
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And so we just move all the

1102
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,400
Constant values over to the other side and off we go.

1103
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,700
So we would have PA X ra.

1104
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:22,300
Y plus PB y.

1105
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,000
Minus P AE y.

1106
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:38,300
RX - PBX are a y equals TB R BX ra y.

1107
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,900
Minus RB y RX.

1108
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,200
Oops.

1109
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,500
There we go.

1110
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,900
And that's the solution to the equation, right?

1111
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:02,700
This just divides out and you end up with these terms being exactly

1112
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:07,500
what they look like and there might be something we can simplify in

1113
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:07,900
there.

1114
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,800
We've got a px P BX r iy r iy.

1115
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,400
So the riy term.

1116
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,100
In this case, look at you can see that it produces is sort of a

1117
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,100
simplified version on this side as well.

1118
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,600
So if we were to simplify these terms a little bit on the top of the

1119
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,100
numerator,

1120
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,600
You can see what we would get here.

1121
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,800
It's p.

1122
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,100
Ax, minus P BX.

1123
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:41,300
Times are a y plus PB y minus p.

1124
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,200
A why?

1125
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,300
Times are ax, right?

1126
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:57,500
That whole thing is divided by RB X ra y minus RB y RX.

1127
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,300
And you can kind of see to what this is.

1128
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,700
This is just the subtraction of the two points.

1129
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,800
So really you know, if we wanted to simplify this even further we

1130
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,800
could talk about this in terms of the Delta between these two because

1131
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,200
if you look at this it's a x minus BX B.

1132
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,900
Y- A, why?

1133
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:29,400
It's sort of like a flipped version of the negation in both cases.

1134
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,300
So you could even write it more in terms of this variable.

1135
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,500
After as well, if you wanted to but there's not any particular

1136
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,500
overriding reason to.

1137
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,500
So you can see it's somewhat nasty just because there's so many

1138
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,800
there's so much namik later in there but it's really pretty

1139
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,400
straightforward.

1140
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,000
When you look at it it's just two subtractions with to multiplies, you

1141
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,500
add those together and then to multiplies with the subtraction on the

1142
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,900
bottom, that's it.

1143
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,000
We also get interesting information about the structure of the problem

1144
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
here so you can see if R BX ra y, minus RB y RX.

1145
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,800
If that's 0

1146
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:14,300
Then we can't solve this equation because you can't divide something

1147
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,600
by 0, right?

1148
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,600
That's a not, it's not just an infinity or something like that.

1149
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:22,200
It's actually undefined what that is, in terms of math, we're trying

1150
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,900
to solve in this case and that actually corresponds to a pretty

1151
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:29,100
straightforward case it corresponds to the case where like these two

1152
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,700
vectors are parallel or something,

1153
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,400
Right.

1154
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,000
Because if these two vectors are parallel, they'll never hit each

1155
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:35,400
other.

1156
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:44,300
You know I'm saying and you can kind of see how that sort of thing

1157
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,000
would happen.

1158
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,700
In this case, you need there to be as far as a DOT product is

1159
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,300
concerned, right?

1160
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,000
If these two vectors are parallel.

1161
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,700
So let's say, I've got, I've got to two dimensional vectors and their

1162
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,000
parallel, right?

1163
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,400
So any two two dimensional vectors that are parallel, doesn't matter

1164
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,500
what direction they're pointing as long as they're pointing in.

1165
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,200
Exactly this.

1166
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,500
It doesn't matter where they're like where they are in this case

1167
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,000
because we're just talking about the vectors.

1168
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,300
If two vectors are parallel, then we know that their dot product is

1169
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,500
just going to be

1170
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Equal to their length.

1171
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,100
right, it's just going to be

1172
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,200
Right.

1173
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,700
We know that this is the fundamental equation for our job product.

1174
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,000
We've been over at tons and tons of times a dot b equals length of a

1175
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,400
length of B cosine Theta, right?

1176
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,700
So we know in this case, the cosine Theta term is going to be one,

1177
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:55,400
right?

1178
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,400
So we know that a transpose B is just going to be equal to length of a

1179
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,100
length of B.

1180
01:14:59,200 --> 01:14:59,900
In this case, in the

1181
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,500
Cynthia Timbers away, which is to say that ax

1182
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,900
X BX plus.

1183
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,400
Ay, y times.

1184
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:17,500
B y is going to be equal to ax minus BX squared.

1185
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:22,300
Plus ay, y minus b y squared.

1186
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,600
Sorry that's not at all.

1187
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:25,700
What?

1188
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,900
I meant one type of time.

1189
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:38,400
Ax squared plus ay, y squared square rooted times.

1190
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:45,300
The x squared, let's be y squared square rooted, right?

1191
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:47,700
That's the length of a and the length of B.

1192
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,400
In this case,

1193
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,500
Right.

1194
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,200
And we know that there's no cosine term because the cosine Theta term

1195
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,800
will have to be one in the case where they are parallel.

1196
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:07,700
In this case, another way to write that would be that.

1197
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,500
Just showing some different equations.

1198
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,200
We could use here to look at the parallel thing.

1199
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:17,500
Another way to write that too would be to say alright I know that if

1200
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,600
two things are parallel

1201
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,000
You know, I've got a vector and it's, you know, you V or whatever.

1202
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,200
I think the right way to say this, I've got some Vector U, let's say

1203
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,000
right and it goes in Direction, I know that anything that is parallel

1204
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,400
to you as a vector has to be equal to some value.

1205
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,300
I'll use the Lambda for that value.

1206
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,400
Anything that's parallel to it, has to be in the form of this

1207
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
equation, right?

1208
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,900
It has to be the U, Vector times some value,

1209
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,200
Right, it can't be anything else because I can't change the Direction.

1210
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,800
All I can do is change the length.

1211
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,500
So in order for a and b to be parallel, another way to write that

1212
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:11,400
would be that a has to be equal to some multiplier times B.

1213
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,600
Right.

1214
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:21,500
I know that that has to be true so that means in this case that a x

1215
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,500
has to be equal to

1216
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:30,400
Lambda X BX, right?

1217
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,800
And a y, has to be equal to Lambda times.

1218
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,400
Be why?

1219
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:36,300
Right.

1220
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,100
If that makes sense.

1221
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,700
So that's another thing that we would know about these two things.

1222
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,800
If they were parallel

1223
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,500
That makes sense.

1224
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,700
So looking at that through here you can also see that I could

1225
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,000
substitute these guys in, don't ask me why I'm going down this.

1226
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,300
I just felt like kind of

1227
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,800
Having a mathematical aside.

1228
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,100
I don't know.

1229
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,800
Maybe we've just been doing.

1230
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,700
Too much math.

1231
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,300
And now I'm in a math Zone.

1232
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:08,300
But anyway, so you can write you can imagine that this equation is

1233
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,300
something that would be true about any two vectors that are going to

1234
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:15,300
be parallel because it means that the cosine term for the dot product

1235
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,600
has to be 1.

1236
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:25,200
And then, similarly, we would expect this to be true as well, right?

1237
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,000
We would expect the the lambdas to be true.

1238
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,200
So, if I took a look at that, a little more closely that would mean,

1239
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,800
that this would be ax.

1240
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,000
BX, would just be Lambda x squared, right?

1241
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:44,800
Because we could substitute in Lambda Lambda x 4, BX, or vice versa,

1242
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:45,500
right?

1243
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,600
In any case, it's also the case that Lambda I look either way, we said

1244
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:49,700
that

1245
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,300
One way to go, I suppose.

1246
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,400
That since I wrote it this way, I'll keep going that way.

1247
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,300
So it's Lambda b.

1248
01:18:55,300 --> 01:19:01,500
X squared plus Lambda b y squared equals.

1249
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:12,000
Lambda x squared plus Lambda actually.

1250
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:12,400
Sorry.

1251
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's a little that Lambda is squared Lambda.

1252
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:22,200
Squared times because there's a Lambda squared now in each of these

1253
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,200
Lambda squared x squared plus Lambda squared.

1254
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:28,600
A y squared x squared plus y squared.

1255
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:30,300
Times.

1256
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,500
I'm sorry, that's Abby.

1257
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,000
Be x squared, plus b, y squared.

1258
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,300
And if you look at what happens here,

1259
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,300
we get that situations that same situation, we pull out the Lambda

1260
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,500
squared, we'd end up with the Lambda here, right?

1261
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,000
And that would go away and those who had multiplied together and we

1262
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,600
would end up with Lambda be x squared, plus py squared, which is

1263
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,000
exactly we have on the other side.

1264
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,200
So this equation just becomes

1265
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,100
On both sides, Lambda be x squared.

1266
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:03,700
Plus 3y squared.

1267
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,400
Right, which is what we would expect for for parallel vectors.

1268
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,100
So, down here, we want to know, you know, what are the conditions for

1269
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:24,200
which this, for which this will end up being 0, right?

1270
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:30,400
And if we imagine what we would get, how would we get a situation

1271
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,600
where this could be 0?

1272
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,700
Well, think about exactly this constraint.

1273
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,100
If I was to say that, I've got my to raise here, because remember

1274
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,000
these are our two rays.

1275
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,500
We've got one Ray that's our ax or a y1r.

1276
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,500
A, that's RBX rby.

1277
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:53,300
If I was to say the exact same thing about these,

1278
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:54,900
Right.

1279
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
So I'm going to say exactly this and a plug it in.

1280
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,100
What this term becomes is Lambda R BX squared, right?

1281
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:12,800
Because I would plug in Lambda R, B, I'm sorry.

1282
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,000
Lambda.

1283
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,200
R BX.

1284
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,400
Ra Y is Lambda rby, right?

1285
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:33,000
So it would be Lambda R BX, rby in this side.

1286
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:34,800
I would get rby.

1287
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,200
This ra X becomes a Lambda R BX of the Lambda comes out.

1288
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:47,600
There are be X and now you can see that Lambda R BX, r b--, y minus

1289
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,600
Lambda R BX rby it's the same.

1290
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,400
Term.

1291
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,300
So they cancel and you get a 0, right?

1292
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:02,600
So you can see right here that the math without us even ever knowing

1293
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:07,000
it, when we wrote it down, has found figured out

1294
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
The fact that this problem we asked it to solve is unsolvable in one

1295
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,900
case, and that case is when these are parallel.

1296
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,100
And it's pretty cool.

1297
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:25,800
I always liked how that works out where it's like we didn't write any

1298
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,600
of this ahead of time, right?

1299
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:34,600
We didn't tell the math anywhere about any of that, but just the fact

1300
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,300
that we constructed the problem.

1301
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,900
As we wanted it automatically produce a mathematical operation

1302
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,500
necessary for its solving

1303
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,800
That tells us that we have a case, we can't solve.

1304
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,000
So if I didn't know that ahead of time.

1305
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:57,500
When I See This come out of the equation, I'm like, oh oops, like now

1306
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:03,900
I know better not feed this anything, where this term can be 0.

1307
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,900
And once you start investigating that term, like I did here, you can

1308
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:12,000
understand what it means, geometrically, and it becomes nice and

1309
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,800
interesting, right?

1310
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:14,600
You're like, oh,

1311
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,100
I got it now.

1312
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,900
All right, so that's a little bit of a, an excessive aside there.

1313
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,700
I admit that.

1314
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,700
I'll go ahead and get that out of there so we can see it more clearly.

1315
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,700
So here's rtb term.

1316
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,900
And so what remains here is in the TA case, we would have to solve by

1317
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:44,900
plugging into this for TB, we can do that very simply, we've already

1318
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:48,900
got ta solved in terms of T be here so we can just plug, whatever the

1319
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:51,900
result is that we get we can just plug it in here and go.

1320
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,100
So let's go ahead and type that in.

1321
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,600
Was the game running this whole time, okay?

1322
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,500
So what we'd like to do here?

1323
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,600
Is just make a math function for this.

1324
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,800
And this math function is just

1325
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,200
Ray intersect to.

1326
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:28,800
We've got a PA and an RA that we've got a PB.

1327
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,300
We're like that being capitalized for what.

1328
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:32,800
I don't know.

1329
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
Math layout in code.

1330
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,200
So he's so unsatisfying.

1331
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,000
And now we've got our Ranger set.

1332
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,200
Call I need to solve for these two things, so I would like to solve

1333
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:50,800
for my TA first and you can see it's PA x minus PB X.

1334
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,000
Right?

1335
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,900
I want to multiply that by our a, at why.

1336
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:06,200
Then I want to add PB y minus PA, y x, r ax like so.

1337
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,800
and what I want to do here is I want to do a divide

1338
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:24,700
I want to divide by RB x times ra Y and I want to subtract our be y

1339
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:25,700
times.

1340
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,000
R ax right?

1341
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,100
So That's mighty, oops.

1342
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,700
Sorry, it's Mighty B value.

1343
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,600
Mighty a value is just

1344
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,500
Up here, you can see it.

1345
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,800
Pby nice.

1346
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,800
PA Why?

1347
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,500
Plus t, b.

1348
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:51,600
X.

1349
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,600
RB y.

1350
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,500
And that whole thing is over.

1351
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,100
All right, bye.

1352
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,000
So that's what we think our equation is in this case.

1353
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,500
Now you can see we've got a problem here.

1354
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,700
This is, I believe correct.

1355
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:30,400
Although, you know, we obviously could have a math bug there, but the

1356
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,700
reason we don't want to leave it in this form, although this is

1357
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:36,900
correct as, because you can see we've produced another divide here

1358
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,700
that could

1359
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,300
Zero, right?

1360
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:45,500
So anytime that are a is y, component is 0.

1361
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,400
This would fail.

1362
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,400
And we know that we've got this condition here of them being parallel.

1363
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,500
Being a failure case.

1364
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,100
We don't want to introduce another failure case, just because we

1365
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,200
didn't plug in the math and follow it through, right?

1366
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:06,100
So what we'd like to do is produce a TA that has this work through

1367
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,800
that goes with the same denominator of possible, right?

1368
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,900
So you know, we've got this over here.

1369
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,600
I suppose this would help here.

1370
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:25,200
I'm using a feature now of Milton that I've never used for this

1371
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:29,300
purpose before I want to write these equations here.

1372
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,100
So we've got ta

1373
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,300
Was pby - PA Why?

1374
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,200
Plus t, b.

1375
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,000
Rby wonder why that drawing doesn't work super well.

1376
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,300
Like that plus didn't come out at all.

1377
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,800
Ta equals pby - PA y + TB.

1378
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,000
Rby, right?

1379
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:08,500
Over are a why?

1380
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:12,300
And then we got this one over here.

1381
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:17,900
2B equals p.

1382
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,500
X- PBX.

1383
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:36,900
R iy plus PB y 1 is p a y r ax.

1384
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,600
R BX R.

1385
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,300
Ey.

1386
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,100
R.

1387
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,900
B-- y RX.

1388
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:52,300
Right.

1389
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,500
So if you look at what's going to happen here, if we wanted to plug T

1390
01:28:56,500 --> 01:29:00,000
be as an actual equation back into ta, right?

1391
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,900
So we want to put this entire term back into here, then we can

1392
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,400
actually will see what Lucy what's going to happen.

1393
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:11,900
Rby is just going to multiply all of these terms.

1394
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:14,100
Right.

1395
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:22,400
So if you take a look at what that's going to mean, in terms of how

1396
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:27,100
this equation is working, you can let's see.

1397
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,900
You can imagine sort of what's going to happen here.

1398
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,400
I've got my ta term.

1399
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,700
Equaling.

1400
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,300
Let's see, what's the best way to work this through.

1401
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:46,100
So, if I isolate this term first, I would get pby - PA Why

1402
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:54,000
over are a y plus and then here's this gigantic nasty term

1403
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,500
He ax PBX.

1404
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:02,800
all right, y+

1405
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,500
B, y- p.

1406
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,200
A why?

1407
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,100
RX.

1408
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:16,800
Those two terms on the top, are going to be X.

1409
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,800
RB y.

1410
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:21,100
So we get an rby in here.

1411
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:22,400
Maybe I'll just

1412
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:27,400
Cleaner than rby in here.

1413
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:32,400
+ p.

1414
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:32,700
B.

1415
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,500
Y- p.

1416
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,300
A why?

1417
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:38,200
RX.

1418
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,200
Oops, rby.

1419
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:46,900
So we have again, this term RX X RB Y and that case

1420
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:53,000
So, we get that whole thing times TB.

1421
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,100
And it's going to be over.

1422
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:05,500
This this situation right here, times that so it's an RA y x, r BX.

1423
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:11,100
Ra y, minus RB y r ax.

1424
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,600
And lovely.

1425
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:25,300
And by lovely, I mean, not at all, lovely for obvious reasons.

1426
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:33,500
So yeah, that's not fabulous to say the least.

1427
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,000
Looking at the amusement that's going to happen here.

1428
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Assuming I haven't already made a math error, which I probably have is

1429
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,900
that I guess the p b.

1430
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,100
Y- p.

1431
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:57,900
Ay, y term exists in both places.

1432
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,900
So here is a pby PA why?

1433
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,000
Right?

1434
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,900
And here's the pby PA, Why?

1435
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:12,100
And that might be the thing that allows us to do something useful here

1436
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,400
in terms of canceling because what we want to do is simplify our

1437
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,400
denominator so that it looks like this again hopefully, right.

1438
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,200
Or something close to it.

1439
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:24,900
So multiplying these three.

1440
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:29,700
What we would get is TA equals this term up here.

1441
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:35,500
So P be y, minus p a y x.

1442
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,400
RB X ra y.

1443
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,200
Minus RB y RX.

1444
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,200
Right.

1445
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:56,100
And then that we're going to add PA X PB why I believe.

1446
01:32:59,200 --> 01:32:59,800
You know, this is really.

1447
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,100
Problematic.

1448
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:05,000
I really need something that's more accurate for drawing because I

1449
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,800
can't it's hard for me to see what my terms end up being, and it's

1450
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,500
easy to make a careless error between the Xs and the Y's here, because

1451
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,500
I can't tell the difference between them a lot, like when I write

1452
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:17,900
them,

1453
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,100
The lag kind of hurts me.

1454
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,500
Like it wouldn't probably on paper I suppose.

1455
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,000
So it's a x minus BX.

1456
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,700
Y minus y.

1457
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,500
So, all of the P values.

1458
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:40,100
Are always equivalent 'add row.

1459
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,700
So, it's pby - PA Why?

1460
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,400
Yeah, and I'm really nervous about that.

1461
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,800
I am almost certain, we won't get this math, right?

1462
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,600
Because of that, I suppose we can go do it on a computer algebra

1463
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,600
system after this.

1464
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,600
Tap check what it comes out to be.

1465
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:12,500
But yeah, like I had just it's like when I draw this a lot of lag in

1466
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:15,800
in the switch between those and so like sometimes it doesn't even pick

1467
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,400
up the.

1468
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,600
Yeah, the thing that's just the nature of it at the moment.

1469
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,400
So anyway, all right.

1470
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,400
But I'll just kind of finish it through nominally.

1471
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,300
And then we're going to have to probably go and use something where I

1472
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,400
can definitely know what the terms are.

1473
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:40,000
So I've got PB y, minus PA, Why cure I'm adding and multiplying

1474
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,400
through by, by this term we got to have that we got to have the ra Y

1475
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:46,900
in there.

1476
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:52,000
So that's also our a y at the head end of it right off by itself.

1477
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:52,800
It's got.

1478
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:53,100
All right.

1479
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:53,500
Why?

1480
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:54,600
That whole situation?

1481
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,500
Then we've got PA xpbex.

1482
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,300
Terms are a yrb.

1483
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,000
Why?

1484
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,100
Oh no, that's not true.

1485
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:16,700
Only this part is multiply that because it already has an r i y in the

1486
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,300
denominator.

1487
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:19,600
Alright yrb why

1488
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:25,500
+ PB y minus PA.

1489
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:30,500
Y r ax rby.

1490
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:40,100
That whole thing is over our a y r BX ra y.

1491
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:45,200
Minus RB y RX T.

1492
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:45,500
Be

1493
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:49,700
Right.

1494
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,500
So looking through this again, I'm pretty sure we can't actually do

1495
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:57,900
this math.

1496
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,800
I'm pretty sure there's been at least one transition.

1497
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,400
Nation by at this point of an X to Y and probably, I guess, what we

1498
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,000
could have done is just use totally different terms for all of these

1499
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,500
to make it easier on ourselves like an, A B C D, E kind of thing.

1500
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,100
I don't know, it becomes hard when you've got this many things to keep

1501
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:19,100
track of them, if they're not named in some way that you can actually

1502
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,600
relate back, but, you know,

1503
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:24,100
What do you do?

1504
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,800
So if you take a look at these as they are, we can at least try to do

1505
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:35,700
what we would do and have some semblance of that here.

1506
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So if we take a look at what happens in terms of pulling out terms,

1507
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,300
we've got P bypa.

1508
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,400
Why subtraction term here?

1509
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:51,000
So that actually groups together and we would end up with a single

1510
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,100
term here that was R BX r iy.

1511
01:36:53,300 --> 01:37:01,800
R BX, R ax, plus the ra X RB y term and so we can go ahead and do that

1512
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:02,100
one.

1513
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,900
BP b y- p.

1514
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,200
A why is this term?

1515
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,000
And we've got, that's just an addition in there.

1516
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,900
So we know we've got our BX.

1517
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:35,200
R iy minus r b y or X plus r, ax rby and these two terms therefore

1518
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,100
would cancel.

1519
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:40,500
You can see, this is an RX rby in both cases, right?

1520
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:46,500
So, we end up with only that we, then add this term, which is PA

1521
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,200
xpbex.

1522
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:51,800
Are Ayr, be why?

1523
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,300
What we're looking to do is cancel the Rai.

1524
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,500
And now we found ourselves in a good position.

1525
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:01,900
There's an RA Y, and an RA Y in both terms.

1526
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:09,600
So those all cancel and we are left only with our be why.

1527
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm sorry PB y, minus PA.

1528
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,200
Why write x r BX.

1529
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:27,900
And P ax P BX X RB y.

1530
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:34,100
But that's a - that should have been - they're, right?

1531
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,100
That should have been -.

1532
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,400
Right.

1533
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,200
It's this term.

1534
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,800
I had the recommend if you're doing math, folks, do it on actual

1535
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,300
Brr.

1536
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,900
Because it's real hard doing it this way.

1537
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:05,600
Let me tell you.

1538
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,900
So, that's the actual term now.

1539
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:19,700
How do we still get it up with a t be in there?

1540
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,600
That was that was dumb.

1541
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,100
That's incorrect.

1542
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:27,700
Right.

1543
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:33,800
There's no TV.

1544
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,500
We substituted T be in.

1545
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,800
So that's what that actually looks like.

1546
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,900
So, looking at that, right?

1547
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:50,000
If we take a look at it, they're pretty much exactly symmetric so,

1548
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,300
rather than solving it that way, which introduces a synthetic / 0, we

1549
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:56,800
don't need to worry about.

1550
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:02,000
We can instead solve it this way with the math work through, which is

1551
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,800
PB y, minus PA y x, RB X Plus PA x, minus PB,

1552
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,800
X times, r b.

1553
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,400
Why

1554
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:17,500
Right.

1555
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:26,000
And these are in terms of the same new denominator exactly wanted.

1556
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:31,400
So I'm going to call this denominator D for denominator.

1557
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,900
And now we get to the actual equation.

1558
01:40:55,700 --> 01:40:56,900
And you can kind of see here.

1559
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,800
What we can do is say, all right, let's compute that denominator.

1560
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:03,500
If the denominator is 0 then they don't have a solution so we're not

1561
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:07,600
going to be able to return anything to you, but if it's nonzero then

1562
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,600
we can go ahead and do it.

1563
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:12,100
Now this is not super numerically stable because as this approaches 0

1564
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:15,700
we will get really huge values.

1565
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:20,000
So in general this Ray intersection routine is not meant for people

1566
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
doing anything wild, right?

1567
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,500
Only really meant for people, doing something saying, and that's fine

1568
01:41:30,900 --> 01:41:32,700
because we know when we're using it, and that's okay.

1569
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:35,100
If we ever need to use something wild, we need to think through the

1570
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,000
math in a different way and take into account, whatever the special

1571
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,600
things are, in the case of that, whatever that thing is that we're

1572
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,100
doing.

1573
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:52,800
So we look here, we can see sort of, our two values for TB and ta and

1574
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,000
I'll go ahead and get rid of that.

1575
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,500
Are you can see here our value for t.

1576
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,800
A is the, the be y

1577
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:06,200
Miss the a y and the ax, minus the BX X, the to our bxr be wise, and

1578
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:09,400
it's almost a symmetric equation in the other case, the PA x minus B.

1579
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,100
BX X.

1580
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,700
RI y, PB, y, minus PA.

1581
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:14,600
Why I must be our X and both /.

1582
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:19,000
This product here, which again, talks about the parallel nature of the

1583
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:19,300
two.

1584
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,300
Raise.

1585
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,400
In this case, like I said, that was pretty hard to read, writing it on

1586
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,800
the, on the Blackboard.

1587
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,400
And so I don't really know that we were able to get that math, right?

1588
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:42,600
I don't have a Cas installed on this machine, but we could, if we want

1589
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,300
to try to get Wolfram Alpha to check our stuff for us.

1590
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,300
I don't really remember the Syntax for Wolfram Alpha.

1591
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:53,800
I think it's similar to Mathematica, but I don't really remember.

1592
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:58,900
So, here's an example.

1593
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,600
Apparently we can just do the two equations separated by a comma.

1594
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,300
In this case, we know what those two equations are, right?

1595
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,300
We use my pen.

1596
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:20,200
This is what we want.

1597
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:26,300
So in this case, we have PA X Plus ta.

1598
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,200
Oh, does it know?

1599
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:36,100
It's not going to think those are all different variables does is it

1600
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:36,900
does it?

1601
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,600
Well, we'll try.

1602
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:54,600
So if PA X Plus ta X re x equals PA PB X Plus t b times R BX.

1603
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,300
and then I have the exact same thing, but in y,

1604
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:14,600
But mu.

1605
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,200
Okay, well ladies and gentlemen, the knowledge engine.

1606
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,200
Can I get it to know that it's a solve somehow?

1607
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,300
Okay, that's fine.

1608
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:54,000
I don't know how to get it to solve these things for us.

1609
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,800
I would, I would like it to say,

1610
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,500
Of a system of equation.

1611
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,200
It did here.

1612
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,800
I don't know how it knew that that was a system of equations and that

1613
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,200
my other one wasn't.

1614
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,500
How do I tell it what to solve for?

1615
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:14,800
Because I'm not telling you what to solve for.

1616
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,000
For, there we go.

1617
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:24,400
For the a

1618
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:35,400
I give up.

1619
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,400
Solve system of equations.

1620
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:41,700
Stephen Wolfram.

1621
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,500
What is the deal?

1622
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,300
This is pretty simple, folks.

1623
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:04,600
I just want to check my math.

1624
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,100
And this is like the most simple thing.

1625
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,300
This is like the most basic thing I could possibly ask you to do.

1626
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:19,600
I just want a computer to check my math for two equations and two

1627
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:20,400
unknowns.

1628
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:24,400
I mean, right?

1629
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,700
I mean, those are the equations, but again, I don't know how to

1630
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,100
I don't know how to make any of these.

1631
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,900
These things know what's a constant and what's not a constant, right?

1632
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,400
Because this is symbolic solve.

1633
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:58,400
I'm asking it to do, I don't want it to solve for numbers.

1634
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,800
Look, I'm not asking it to solve a numerical equation.

1635
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,500
but,

1636
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,800
I give up, who knows?

1637
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,900
Maybe we'll never know.

1638
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:27,600
Anyway, that is the math as we worked it out.

1639
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,400
There's our two dimensional array intersection case you provide the to

1640
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:35,400
raise and it does the intersection call that it produces the

1641
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,400
intersection back.

1642
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,800
Which I'm just going to say for now is Right.

1643
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,300
Someday, we'll find something that can check our math for us.

1644
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,000
How this isn't just built into an editor these days?

1645
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:47,900
I have no idea.

1646
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,500
Computer programming is so ridiculous.

1647
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,800
It's like it hasn't changed in in 40 years and

1648
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,800
somehow we still are up in a situation where

1649
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,300
Can't even check basic math without buying a fifteen hundred dollar

1650
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,900
piece of software apparently.

1651
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:13,100
Anyway, grumpiness aside here's our Ray intersect to let's just assume

1652
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:18,200
it's right for now because we can fix it later when we can actually

1653
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,800
check the mass somehow and we'll just look at how will we use it if we

1654
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,000
knew it was correct.

1655
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:26,600
So assuming that we have an upright transform, we have exactly the

1656
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:29,900
situation that I was talking about before we

1657
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,400
Know exactly what our construction is, because I described it

1658
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:34,200
previously.

1659
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:39,400
And so we've got our basic point that were passing down, that basic

1660
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:43,900
point that we're passing down, is this entity P right here?

1661
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,500
We know the camera transform because that's something that's set in

1662
01:48:48,500 --> 01:48:49,200
the render group.

1663
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:54,100
So we can extract the axis of that transform if we want to and use

1664
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:59,400
that as that other value, we were talking about.

1665
01:48:59,700 --> 01:48:59,800
But

1666
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,900
Now we just need one of the thing that we have not specified and that

1667
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:05,900
is the card, whatever that card access is.

1668
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,500
And I don't know what that card access should necessarily be yet.

1669
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:15,700
Let's say for sake of argument that card.

1670
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,600
You know that standing up angle.

1671
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,400
I don't know what that's what that is exactly.

1672
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,100
But you know this is this is the card.

1673
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:29,800
The card is going to be something in y z, right?

1674
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,400
Right, we'll call this card y, z going up.

1675
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:37,100
And that Vector is just going to be something like

1676
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:39,800
I don't know.

1677
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,300
Probably going.

1678
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:44,900
Maybe 25 + y + 75.

1679
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,200
+ z.

1680
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:48,000
Like a, the cards probably should be fairly upright.

1681
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,900
They shouldn't go too far and why?

1682
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,000
I don't know, but maybe not could be point five point five.

1683
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,500
Something like that.

1684
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:56,000
This is not normalized at the moment, but we don't need it to be

1685
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,700
normalized.

1686
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:00,000
Like I said, we solved for the intersection not expecting anything to

1687
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,300
be normalized, so that should be fine.

1688
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,900
So, we have the card X Y, that's what that Vector is.

1689
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:07,500
One of our vectors.

1690
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:08,800
The other Vector that we

1691
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:12,200
To know is the one along the ground.

1692
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:17,600
So we need a another piece of information, which is the camera Y is e

1693
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,100
Vector.

1694
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:20,000
We don't know what that is yet.

1695
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,900
So will we have to extract that out of the of the other transform?

1696
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,500
But now we know everything else.

1697
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,200
I guess we also need to know the campy.

1698
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,500
So this is the camp eyz, I guess we'll do it this way.

1699
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,800
This is the card Ray.

1700
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:40,700
Gamma ray.

1701
01:50:42,900 --> 01:50:48,800
And the car pyz is just going to be entry P YZ.

1702
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,500
And that's everything that we would need to solve this equation.

1703
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,000
So we just need to extract these two out, right?

1704
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,800
But otherwise, when we call the ray intersect code,

1705
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:03,600
This would give us the intersect point.

1706
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,000
That we were looking for.

1707
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:13,100
Between the two rays.

1708
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:18,100
So the camp eyz, cam ryz?

1709
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:21,400
This is the card ryz.

1710
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:23,800
Sorry card pyz

1711
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,900
or ryz.

1712
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,400
This would give us the intersection point.

1713
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,600
So if we take a look,

1714
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:39,500
At what that's giving us on the diagram, that intersection point is

1715
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,800
the distance along the ray.

1716
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,600
We would go to find the point that we're talking about.

1717
01:51:46,100 --> 01:51:47,700
And so, in this case,

1718
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:59,600
in this case, we already know the y axis is going to be this axis.

1719
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:04,800
So we actually already kind of know what this is going to be, right?

1720
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:11,800
We sort of are getting an input from the user which is trying to

1721
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,300
rotate that and we're going to have to take that into account

1722
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:15,300
separately.

1723
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:20,400
In terms of when we want to start allowing that that Shear to occur,

1724
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,800
which I guess I hadn't thought of

1725
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:23,300
Out too much in this case.

1726
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,800
So we may have to kind of go back that in a little bit more later.

1727
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:34,100
But for now what we're trying to do when we get this, this Ray

1728
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:39,600
information out is the distance from the along, the camera to get to.

1729
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:44,100
It is going to be here the distance from the point along card.

1730
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:48,800
Our y z is going to be rtb value, right?

1731
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,200
So, the thing that comes out in in y, right?

1732
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:56,100
That is actually going to be the value that we need to go along.

1733
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:58,000
That's how long our y-axis.

1734
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,400
Needs to be basically.

1735
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,500
So you know, in this case we've got the size, why?

1736
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,800
Yet, we've got our size Y, and that's going to come into play when we

1737
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:23,100
compute these two things.

1738
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:29,800
And we've got our y-axis computation, which now is going to be down

1739
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:32,100
here, and that's going to be

1740
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:48,000
This unfortunately this we need to sort of put it to do in here.

1741
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:57,100
Because right now we're sort of just going to be doing this, right?

1742
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:59,800
We're going to be assuming we're going to get the size right.

1743
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,600
But we wouldn't handle the rotation right yet.

1744
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,800
In terms of correcting, this card.

1745
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:11,500
So, when we get the camera pyz and the camera ryz here, then we'll be

1746
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,100
good to go.

1747
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:17,100
So let's see how we would get those out in terms of our

1748
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,100
Render group.

1749
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,600
We know that we have our projection Matrix which is the one that we're

1750
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:30,500
using at the moment and that projection Matrix actually has the

1751
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:31,900
information that we want.

1752
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:36,500
So if we want the Y and Z locations of the camera, we could back them

1753
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:37,200
out from here.

1754
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:41,000
But what I would prefer to do is actually not have to do that every

1755
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,300
time we want to look at them.

1756
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:48,100
So I would rather have something which basically just stores this

1757
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:56,100
This info for us because when we want to do computations with them,

1758
01:54:56,100 --> 01:55:00,000
it's nice to be able to grab that out and we can do that very easily

1759
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,400
because we know when they're set.

1760
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:05,600
So what I'd like to do is say all right if we want to get the camera p

1761
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,600
y z we should be able to get that directly out of the group.

1762
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:18,100
So the camera p y and the camera pz is exactly that and I guess I can

1763
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:18,900
just do it this way.

1764
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,900
So the only confusing thing is, how do we get camera?

1765
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:26,000
Ryz.

1766
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:31,400
And in order to get that rate, we need to figure out that kind of

1767
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:38,900
offset along the cameras, y-axis, right?

1768
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,400
Remember we way back.

1769
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:45,500
When we started the math, we drew this and we said well, wherever the

1770
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:50,100
entities point is, there's the cameras y-axis, it needs to go out that

1771
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:51,200
much height.

1772
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:53,700
Right along that axis.

1773
01:55:54,800 --> 01:56:00,100
So we need to say that the cameras are y, z is going to be whatever

1774
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:03,800
the cameras position is, right?

1775
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:08,900
We're going to subtract that away, and we're going to have the

1776
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,600
Entities placement wherever it is.

1777
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:23,000
Plus the height, which is that size y times, whatever that camera

1778
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:28,300
y-axis is because that's what we're moving along, right?

1779
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:32,800
And this will give us that camera Vector, that's pointing down.

1780
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:43,400
So, that's actually all the code right that actually does everything.

1781
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:44,300
We want it to do.

1782
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:47,800
In this case, there's nothing more to it.

1783
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:52,100
And then, you know, we obviously want to

1784
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:56,500
critic ate this.

1785
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:11,200
Because we don't actually want to do this operation if we're not

1786
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:13,300
talking about one of those Sprites, it's supposed to kind of be

1787
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:15,000
standing upright.

1788
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,100
So if we take a look at what's supposed to be happening here, we just

1789
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:21,100
look at this, we're like okay, this is the math that we're talking

1790
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:25,000
about that we worked out again, we probably have a bunch of bugs in

1791
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:25,300
there.

1792
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:27,600
We don't even know if this routine is correct yet because we can't

1793
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:31,100
check it at the moment and we need to check it.

1794
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:31,900
But

1795
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:37,400
What we can do is finish off this before the end of the day, we can go

1796
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:41,100
down here to when we actually set our camera transforms.

1797
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:45,100
When we set our camera transforms, we can

1798
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:54,300
We can take those camera X and y's and actually use those to get to

1799
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,100
set up what we actually want to do.

1800
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:00,100
So in here when we do our set camera transform, I want to take a look

1801
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:01,700
at who is calling that the moment.

1802
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:27,200
That's all fine.

1803
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,000
And that's all fine.

1804
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:36,800
So if we want to I think the way I'd like to do this because we this

1805
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,800
is already known I think I'd like to do something like this.

1806
01:58:45,500 --> 01:58:48,900
Which I think is how we had it before but I feel like we maybe want to

1807
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:52,000
do that because I want to store this information and I'd rather not

1808
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,900
have people have to back it out.

1809
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:00,900
So it kind of feels to me like, maybe that would be the best way to do

1810
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:01,300
it.

1811
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:05,700
So, you know, in here, when we got World mode, instead of calling the

1812
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:10,400
camera, transform code, maybe we just, oh, we force you to pass this

1813
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,100
in here.

1814
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:15,400
Instead because we want them to be stored because there are things.

1815
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,200
We're going to need to do computation on.

1816
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:18,800
We could back them out from here.

1817
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,900
But then we're doing a bunch of math for no reason because we already

1818
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:24,400
have that information if that makes sense.

1819
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:29,600
So that kind of feels like probably a good idea there.

1820
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,400
So maybe I'll do this.

1821
01:59:43,600 --> 01:59:45,200
And then inside render group.

1822
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I'll do something like this.

1823
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,200
and that's the way we had it before and I figured well, it was easier

1824
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:11,600
to pass in a matrix but in this case, I do kind of feel like it is

1825
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:18,600
It's a little more interesting to do it this way because then I can

1826
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,500
save those values which is what I want.

1827
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:33,800
and in this case, that makes this a little bit more of a pain, but

1828
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:34,600
only a little

1829
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:44,400
And in fact, now that I think about it, we could just do something

1830
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:45,000
like this.

1831
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:12,200
and for you,

1832
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:28,100
That is not nearly as messed up as I was expecting it to be given how

1833
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:32,300
little we had testing wise there, but you can see we've still got some

1834
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:34,900
nastiness here, right?

1835
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:43,700
Right.

1836
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:47,300
You can kind of see, we've got a little bit wrong in our, in our, it's

1837
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,400
not completely wrong, but it's pretty close.

1838
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:55,300
So yeah, so you know, we're not too far off, I'm going to stop there

1839
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:57,700
because we're going to have to go dig into that math.

1840
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:05,600
And like I said, it should be pretty easy to check the work but that's

1841
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:06,200
okay.

1842
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,400
And like I said, it's really hard.

1843
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:18,100
I did not do it on paper, they're those terms all, look the same, the

1844
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:19,800
drawing is just not High Fidelity enough.

1845
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:24,100
It's kind of laggy and it has a lot of noise in it and it's really

1846
02:02:24,100 --> 02:02:26,200
hard to do my handwriting.

1847
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:27,500
Isn't that great to begin with?

1848
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:32,400
So it can't really handle that extra suffering but

1849
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,200
But we will check it out.

1850
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:47,900
So if there any cute questions for now, I can take them.

1851
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:51,500
If not, we will deal with it next weekend.

1852
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,600
Finishing the debugging there and then we should be good to go.

1853
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,500
The games there was a lot of chat about Wolfram expecting one letter

1854
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:15,700
variable names and interpreting RBX as R times B times x.

1855
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:17,600
Yeah, I was wondering if it would do that, I don't know.

1856
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:23,700
Building strong.

1857
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:27,600
Didn't we do this math when doing the screen projection?

1858
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:28,800
We might have.

1859
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,700
I don't remember.

1860
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,700
We didn't pull it out into a function if we did though.

1861
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:15,700
Nympho asked to think we did an epilepsy warning there, I don't know.

1862
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,500
I don't know what doesn't doesn't trigger epilepsy.

1863
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:45,300
Pepe fell.

1864
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:45,700
Hello yesterday.

1865
02:04:45,700 --> 02:04:47,700
I was asking about shaders and the z-buffer.

1866
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:49,000
Could I rephrase the question?

1867
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,000
It will be the last time.

1868
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,400
Sure.

1869
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,500
Messy all that maybe if you swap the order of the some on TB, you get

1870
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:08,100
an equation more similar to TA.

1871
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:14,200
They're already pretty similar.

1872
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,400
You just talking about getting the wise lined up.

1873
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:38,500
Something like that.

1874
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:04,500
Can we show again the equation?

1875
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:05,000
Yes.

1876
02:06:05,300 --> 02:06:07,200
So the equation is

1877
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:17,600
In these terms, right?

1878
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:24,600
It is that we want PA X, Plus

1879
02:06:25,700 --> 02:06:37,200
ta X are a x to equal PB x + TB X, RB X and

1880
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:39,800
At the same time.

1881
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:42,400
Why?

1882
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,200
So we're saying a base Point.

1883
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:48,500
PA plus some scalar times.

1884
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:54,700
The raid erection a equals some base point B, plus some scalar times

1885
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:57,600
the rate erection be, right?

1886
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,000
And that's all we want.

1887
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:08,300
Is just it's literally just a plus BC equals D plus EF in X and Y.

1888
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:10,000
Right?

1889
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:12,900
Is the stream Weekends Only now?

1890
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:14,000
Yes, the stream is Weekends.

1891
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:14,500
Only now,

1892
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:34,800
1935 is Molly Rockets upcoming volitional fiction game.

1893
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,500
Oh, it's about actually knows that that's cool.

1894
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,800
Pepe Valdez had meteor is a 2-D game.

1895
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:42,200
My idea would be to treat the Z variable, not as the Z coordinate, but

1896
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:46,200
as a variable that the pixel Shader will use to kill hidden pixels and

1897
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,800
do alpha blending with the GPU power.

1898
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:59,000
Well, so the first part is like, well, the Z value is that is what the

1899
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Z value is.

1900
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:00,300
So

1901
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:06,600
Are doing exactly that but if the Z coordinate is, we want it to be

1902
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,700
where the thing is in 3D.

1903
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:10,400
That's what gives us the depth sorting that we want.

1904
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:13,300
Alpha blending.

1905
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:17,300
On the other hand, you would have to say, how do you think the alpha

1906
02:08:17,300 --> 02:08:19,200
blending will work, right?

1907
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,700
Because the only way to do alpha blending is to have sorted, a sorted

1908
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:27,500
order of combinations of the things that you're passing down.

1909
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:32,500
And so there really is no way to use the z-buffer for that.

1910
02:08:32,700 --> 02:08:36,800
Unless you do like I talked about a while back something which

1911
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:41,200
actually uses frame buffer atomics to keep a list of all the things

1912
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:41,800
you do.

1913
02:08:42,500 --> 02:08:45,300
And then resolve them at the end, right?

1914
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:19,800
Let's see.

1915
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,100
Either questions about what we're doing.

1916
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,800
Doesn't look like there are any other questions about the code?

1917
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:15,700
Just to ask the person who wanted to know about seeing the equations

1918
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,800
again, did this do that?

1919
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:20,800
Was this what you wanted to know in terms of what the equations are?

1920
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:28,600
Master Yoda.

1921
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:29,200
Are you doing this?

1922
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,900
So you can mix perspective, projection in orthographic projection for

1923
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:32,700
game objects.

1924
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,100
Yes, basically.

1925
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:41,900
It's so that I don't have to.

1926
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:49,900
It said that if I want to I can just always think of everything in the

1927
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:54,600
same world space and not have to think about everything is maybe going

1928
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:57,800
through two different matrices paths and having the lineup and stuff

1929
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:58,400
like that.

1930
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:02,600
So I was kind of hoping I could figure out a good way here to just

1931
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:06,400
output Sprite cards that do whatever we want and we can keep them all

1932
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,300
in the same space.

1933
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:32,400
Brooke tag.

1934
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:35,400
Now we have the alpha issue with the 3D stuff is that easier to fix

1935
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:38,100
than the 2D sort because you already know how to fix that.

1936
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,600
It's not necessarily easier to fix.

1937
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:43,400
It's just that going through the z-buffer path.

1938
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:49,400
We are guaranteed that we can scale properly because we know that we,

1939
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:55,700
you know, we can basically treat the edge Alpha as something that can

1940
02:11:55,700 --> 02:11:57,200
be solved via.

1941
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,800
For example, Alpha to coverage in a multi sample buffer.

1942
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,400
Want to or maybe there's other good techniques we can employ for that

1943
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:10,000
just just a little Edge Alpha and then for shadows and stuff like

1944
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,500
that, we probably won't have to sort those.

1945
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,200
We can probably just break them into two groups things that are Shadow

1946
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,000
like and things that aren't

1947
02:12:22,700 --> 02:12:24,100
And draw them into passes.

1948
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,100
So I think we should be able to get away with not having to do.

1949
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:32,400
Enter object sorting pretty much at all for the most part.

1950
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:37,000
And that's really what I wanted to get away from so it's not like it's

1951
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:40,300
still completely trivial, it's just

1952
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:46,800
You know, it's it's something that will scale better because I want to

1953
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,000
be able to have lots of Sprites on the screen.

1954
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,900
And I don't want to have to constantly worry.

1955
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:58,100
if that makes sense, I don't want to constantly worry about

1956
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:05,600
The, the sort being a bottleneck because there's lots of things we can

1957
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:09,700
do per pixel to try stuff on the GPU.

1958
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:14,700
And there's not a lot, we can do to speed up the Sorting when lots of

1959
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:15,700
Sprites are overlapping.

1960
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:19,000
It's just sort and sort is bad sorts and squared, worst case.

1961
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,800
It'll in a lot of these algorithms.

1962
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:25,200
It's n log n, even if you do it, most optimally,

1963
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:35,300
Somebody ran the equation through Matlab, which is what I want to

1964
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:35,800
check.

1965
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:41,300
It says, this could be the solution at least for Matlab - PA XR B.

1966
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:44,300
Y- P Ayr bx- PB X.

1967
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:48,500
RB y, plus PB y x RB X over.

1968
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:51,500
So the denominator is the same.

1969
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:57,700
the numerator is at least slightly different

1970
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,400
Let's take a look.

1971
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:14,700
I'd like to take a look while we're here just to see

1972
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:18,600
Good.

1973
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:22,200
So people plug this into some math software which is what I want to

1974
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:22,600
do.

1975
02:14:23,300 --> 02:14:24,900
So I would like to check this work.

1976
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:26,400
Let's take a look here.

1977
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:35,900
So we have P ax, I'm looking at the one from derive 6 here, we have PA

1978
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:44,000
X RB Y, which is what we expect - PA y, x, r BX.

1979
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:45,600
So, it looks like it.

1980
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:46,800
Multiply this out.

1981
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:50,000
Let me go ahead and multiply this out just so we can see a little bit

1982
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:50,300
easier.

1983
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:51,400
What we have here.

1984
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:54,800
So we have p a XR B.

1985
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:59,800
Y- P BX rby.

1986
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:02,800
Plus pby.

1987
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:12,100
R BX, minus PA, y, RB X over D and the equation here at.

1988
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:16,900
They're both of our i yr, b, x, minus r, XR, B, RB Y, which is what we

1989
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:18,200
had, right?

1990
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:27,000
Although, they've got it the other way around, so, they have, we have

1991
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:31,900
ra y times, R, BX o, no x minus RX Ry.

1992
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:35,600
So, they've got the same denominator in both cases, which is what

1993
02:15:35,600 --> 02:15:36,600
we've got, right.

1994
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:38,100
The denominators match up.

1995
02:15:45,500 --> 02:15:46,300
So, that's good.

1996
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:50,100
And then in the TA case P.

1997
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:50,500
XR.

1998
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:51,200
B, y.

1999
02:15:52,600 --> 02:16:00,200
That's what we've got here - PA y, RB x py r BX, what we got here - PB

2000
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:00,500
X?

2001
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:06,100
RB y plus PB y r BX?

2002
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,200
So that looks like the same thing.

2003
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:14,600
TB is pxr, a why?

2004
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:26,300
PBX are a y pa, why are exp a yre x and it's a negative, then a - P

2005
02:16:26,300 --> 02:16:26,800
BX.

2006
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:27,000
R.

2007
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:27,700
Ey.

2008
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:33,500
+ A+ pby times re X+ pby.

2009
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:35,400
So it looks like we got it right?

2010
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:41,600
So it looks like that's correct shockingly.

2011
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:46,600
So that's good.

2012
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:53,000
All right, so our Ranger section math might be good and that's good

2013
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,799
because that would mean that all we have to do is just take a look at

2014
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,900
our usage of it.

2015
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,900
A little more closely and make sure that we're doing everything

2016
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:04,299
correctly.

2017
02:17:04,299 --> 02:17:06,200
This this part right here, obviously is

2018
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:13,100
Kind of hastily thrown together that I was just putting in there.

2019
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:17,900
But, you know, this thing about grabbing out the camera position and

2020
02:17:17,900 --> 02:17:25,600
taking the, the ryz which is the entries sort of ground point, plus

2021
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:30,799
the cameras y-axis, how far we wanted it to go, how far we wanted it

2022
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:33,400
to appear along that y-axis.

2023
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:38,799
And then we took from there and subtract it away the cameras location

2024
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,500
to get the vector.

2025
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:46,000
Kind of going towards that Grand Point and and then we kind of made up

2026
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:51,799
the card, poking access there, that makes sense.

2027
02:18:00,900 --> 02:18:04,299
Well, this is just totally bogus is why we never really finished this

2028
02:18:04,299 --> 02:18:04,500
out.

2029
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:05,000
Did we?

2030
02:18:05,700 --> 02:18:08,900
So we were supposed to use this as the card y'see

2031
02:18:10,299 --> 02:18:11,000
first of all,

2032
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:17,500
That's what we actually are supposed to put their.

2033
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:20,500
So technically, we weren't doing that at all.

2034
02:18:23,299 --> 02:18:24,200
That's pretty weird.

2035
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:30,900
so actually,

2036
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:38,500
We're surprisingly good.

2037
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:43,500
So far, our lower set of trees is not correct but our upper set is

2038
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:45,299
basically exactly, right?

2039
02:18:45,299 --> 02:18:47,799
Looks like that's exactly what I wanted there.

2040
02:18:47,799 --> 02:18:51,200
You can see it's keeping this guy quite, right?

2041
02:18:51,299 --> 02:18:53,100
So we're not correcting, you know?

2042
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:57,700
We haven't tried correcting the sheer yet but that's

2043
02:18:59,100 --> 02:19:01,200
That's quite good, actually.

2044
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:08,400
Yeah.

2045
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:10,799
I'm very happy with that.

2046
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:15,299
All right, but we still have some issues here.

2047
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:16,200
The

2048
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:19,000
in terms of,

2049
02:19:22,299 --> 02:19:25,799
Getting these guys to line up, which might we, you know, we also do

2050
02:19:25,799 --> 02:19:27,000
sort of have the issue.

2051
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,100
I don't think this is that that issue though.

2052
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:32,299
But we do also have the issue of the parallel lines as well.

2053
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:32,799
Obviously.

2054
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:35,100
So there is that issue but that's, that's actually pretty good.

2055
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:36,299
So we're in pretty good shape there.

2056
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,299
So, that's good.

2057
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:04,100
And Master Yoda said, it seems that valve has two solutions in the

2058
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:06,000
Gated in relation to yours.

2059
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:13,600
Negated in in the whole meaning of the whole thing is negated like

2060
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:14,100
that.

2061
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:38,200
miss you at Val buses is

2062
02:20:43,300 --> 02:20:48,400
Yeah, it does look like yours are negated, but, why, so why the other

2063
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:50,500
one is not negated?

2064
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:55,100
How did we get to computer algebra programs to produce two different

2065
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:55,900
results?

2066
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:58,900
Because did you guys look at the one that

2067
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:06,100
I had that peppy Val posted there from Drive,

2068
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:31,500
I'm do we know which one of those is correct?

2069
02:21:31,500 --> 02:21:36,000
Because it doesn't look like, I mean, you shouldn't be able to negate

2070
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:36,700
them both?

2071
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,500
Or not negate them.

2072
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:40,700
Both right?

2073
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:44,300
You should have to do one or the other is the correct answer.

2074
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:45,500
And so,

2075
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:51,000
I'm wondering since I haven't done it through the computer algebra

2076
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,800
system, I'm wondering why derive, 6, did someone enter it in a weird

2077
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:59,200
way, like, why or did I check it wrong?

2078
02:22:00,700 --> 02:22:01,500
You know what I'm saying?

2079
02:22:08,500 --> 02:22:12,500
Because I don't think it can't be both and I'm pretty sure that that I

2080
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,400
checked it correctly versus yeah.

2081
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:18,500
So I'm pretty sure it's not negated in that sense.

2082
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,800
But we'll have to see and I think ours I think that looks pretty right

2083
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:27,500
to me too.

2084
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:33,200
I feel like we're correct here but I could be wrong about that.

2085
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:40,800
And also that's very stable like this is looking quite good.

2086
02:22:42,600 --> 02:22:43,900
It's just at

2087
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:52,100
As we flip around through one part of the projection, we get a bogus

2088
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:55,600
answer through there but like, look at how stable that is everywhere

2089
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:56,500
else, right?

2090
02:22:56,500 --> 02:23:00,400
We just have a singularity there which may be the parallel projection.

2091
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:03,000
Part of things will have to take a look at it, but you can see that

2092
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,100
it's very stable for everywhere else, right?

2093
02:23:06,100 --> 02:23:09,800
Like it's getting it's doing exactly the correct Sprite thing,

2094
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:11,300
everywhere else.

2095
02:23:14,900 --> 02:23:20,600
It's worth noting too that we can always do sort of a separate thing

2096
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:24,100
which is that one easiest right thing to do and it's not necessarily

2097
02:23:24,100 --> 02:23:25,200
the right thing that I want to do.

2098
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:28,300
But in addition to this, we also have

2099
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:39,700
another option here, which is that, you know, the entry x axis equal

2100
02:23:39,700 --> 02:23:44,400
size x, x group camera.

2101
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:46,600
X.

2102
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:53,100
Hammer wine.

2103
02:23:54,800 --> 02:23:59,700
And so, if you want just regular Sprite cards, you

2104
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,900
That as well, right?

2105
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:07,400
So you can see it's very easy to just produce a standards right card,

2106
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:12,600
but that's not necessarily what we want to do here, right?

2107
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:16,100
The reason for that is standard Sprite cards, don't

2108
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,300
Don't stand up properly.

2109
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:25,900
If you're looking down at a steep angle right there they're tilted in

2110
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:30,500
kind of a bat in a not sufficient way potentially it might be that

2111
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:33,600
that's still fine and we'll have to play with it but I wanted to have

2112
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:39,800
the ability to do something a little fancier they're potentially.

2113
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,800
So we'll play with it a little more, but you can see that if we wanted

2114
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,700
to do something like this, we could just leave it like that.

2115
02:24:45,700 --> 02:24:47,600
And that would be fine, right?

2116
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:48,600
These, you can see that.

2117
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:50,600
What we're getting here is now really.

2118
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:54,600
Our only problem is with shadows, right?

2119
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:59,400
That the alpha R Alpha stuff is is bad, right?

2120
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:02,200
If we were to clip out.

2121
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:25,900
Everything that had Alpha in it.

2122
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:29,800
By setting the alpha Funk to get rid of it.

2123
02:25:30,500 --> 02:25:34,400
Then you can kind of see, we pretty much have no problems in it at

2124
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:36,700
all, at that point, right?

2125
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:41,600
But unfortunately, that you know what?

2126
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:46,400
That's I've never done that test before you can see that are our

2127
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:49,400
Sprites don't have perfect Alpha everywhere, right?

2128
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:54,900
Those must have like 250, 4253, Alphas or whatever, but you can see

2129
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,600
that we don't have any of those problems anymore.

2130
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:57,700
And really, the only thing we

2131
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,500
I have to fix this with a cup-like are rectangles are drawing right on

2132
02:26:00,500 --> 02:26:02,000
top of each other, so you get the Z fighting.

2133
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:05,700
But other than that, we don't have any problems, right?

2134
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:07,900
Are sorting is all now perfect.

2135
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:10,300
And everything's good, right?

2136
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:18,300
So really we just need to again, figure out sort of roughly what our

2137
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:20,500
solution other problems going to be and how we're going to handle that

2138
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:21,100
Alpha.

2139
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:27,000
Because at the moment, we don't have a, we don't have anything any

2140
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,600
solution at all for the alpha.

2141
02:26:32,700 --> 02:26:35,900
I wonder if it would be sufficient to just the game just works like

2142
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:36,400
that.

2143
02:26:37,300 --> 02:26:38,000
I wonder.

2144
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:41,500
Without doing anything else.

2145
02:26:41,500 --> 02:26:42,600
You just do it that way.

2146
02:26:42,600 --> 02:26:47,500
I wonder if the Sorting works properly because it works pretty well,

2147
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:48,800
right.

2148
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:54,600
If we went ahead and solve the alpha problem, which we have to do

2149
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:58,000
either way, maybe that's just sufficient.

2150
02:27:06,100 --> 02:27:08,700
I don't know, it's an interesting question because it, I guess you

2151
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:09,900
really don't need.

2152
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:12,900
You just need to only the tiniest amount of Z overlap.

2153
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,500
So if you just tilt the camera, just a little bit

2154
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:20,800
You know, I don't know.

2155
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,100
Maybe that's efficient.

2156
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:29,300
It's an interesting question.

2157
02:27:31,900 --> 02:27:33,100
It's an interesting question.

2158
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:52,300
All right, anyway, we'll take a look at this next week and basically

2159
02:27:52,300 --> 02:27:55,300
what we're trying to do now is just again kind of converge on a good

2160
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:59,000
solution for how we're going to do the Sprites and then we can move on

2161
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,700
to dealing with our Alpha.

2162
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:05,500
Because that's really the only visual artifact problem that will have

2163
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:08,000
once we get the Sprites have lined up.

2164
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,600
However we want them to be, we just had to figure out what a good

2165
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:13,700
solution would be for our Alpha compositing.

2166
02:28:14,700 --> 02:28:17,800
And that might involve doing like something like Alpha to coverage.

2167
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:20,100
It might involve doing something else.

2168
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:20,700
I don't know.

2169
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,900
So we'll have to think a little bit about that.

2170
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,300
And think about how we want to solve that problem because, again, that

2171
02:28:28,300 --> 02:28:33,900
is the one trans like translucent or transparent objects.

2172
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:37,400
Are the things that rasterize our pipelines have the very hardest time

2173
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:39,900
with because of that Reliance on the Z buffer.

2174
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:44,800
That's just how it goes.

2175
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:48,900
So that's the thing, we get, everything else for free, we don't have

2176
02:28:48,900 --> 02:28:50,100
to the sword anymore.

2177
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:54,000
Everything else is nice and clean through the entire pipeline, but you

2178
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:58,000
still run into that that nasty bit of how you're going to deal with

2179
02:28:59,800 --> 02:29:01,500
with transparency and translucency.

2180
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:04,200
So that's the one thing we're going to have to address.

2181
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:05,200
All right?

2182
02:29:05,300 --> 02:29:06,500
I'm gonna go ahead and close down.

2183
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:15,700
Thank you everyone for joining me, for another episode of handmade

2184
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:16,000
hero.

2185
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,200
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

2186
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:22,000
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

2187
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,500
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org and it comes with the

2188
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:26,200
source code, so you can play around with it.

2189
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:29,500
We also have the forums, you can go to ask questions a patreon page.

2190
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:32,600
You can go to, to support the video series, schedule, bot the tweets,

2191
02:29:32,600 --> 02:29:33,500
the schedule, it you.

2192
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,200
And at episode guide, where you can go to catch up on old episodes,

2193
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:38,700
that's about it for this week.

2194
02:29:39,800 --> 02:29:43,200
I will be back next week, same time probably but check the

2195
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:43,700
Tweetbot.

2196
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:47,100
If you want to know for sure, until then have fun programming and I'll

2197
02:29:47,100 --> 02:29:48,300
see you on the internet.

2198
02:29:48,300 --> 02:29:49,200
Take it easy, buddy.
