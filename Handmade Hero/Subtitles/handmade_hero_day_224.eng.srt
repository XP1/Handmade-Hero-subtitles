1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Start recording.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,300
All right.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,800
Thank you very much for joining me.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,700
Welcome to handmade hero.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,300
Sure, we could complete game live on stream.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,300
We are going to do a little bit, a little, a little bit of

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,000
prefetching.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Today is what we're going to be doing.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,400
You just this past week, we put all the cutscenes in for the

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
introduction sequence, for our game.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,900
And one of the things that you'll notice, if you pay really close,

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,500
attention them, which admittedly is pretty tough to do because video

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,600
stream in there and that's kind of low quality even then.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,300
in the video on demand like the YouTube videos are pretty low quality,

15
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,800
so unless you actually ran it yourself at home cuz you follow along

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,200
with the source code or if you watched like, the videos that are

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
shipped on the handmade hero,

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,300
We have a handmade hero BitTorrent, you can access on the Forum site

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
where you can get like high-quality recordings if you saw those you

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,300
definitely would have seen this if you haven't then it may have been

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,900
hard to notice because it's so janky.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,300
It looks so sort of crappy with the video compression.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,400
Anyway, you can't maybe pick up on some of these problems but there

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,900
definitely was a problem and it was a problem that I want to leave

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,400
till the end.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
So you can kind of see, I could explain a little bit and see how to

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,900
fix it.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,100
That's what we're going to be doing today, today's day to 24.

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,000
So, if you're following along at home and you pre-ordered the game,

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,000
M, 2 or you can download the source code and follow along by using day

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,900
223 source code, that's the source code that I'm starting with here.

32
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,000
So let me just try and see if I can point out what the bug actually is

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,600
and I mean bug is a tough term user because it suggests that

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
something's not working properly when actually everything is working

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,800
properly.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,400
So, I guess what I really mean is objectionable artifact, something

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,900
that we would like to get rid of if we can write.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,500
So it's not really that the code is broken, but it's that the code

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,400
isn't as good as it should be, right.

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,100
And so here's what happens when we switch from this scene to the next

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,500
scene.

42
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,800
What I'd like you to do is pay close attention to what happens right

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,900
at the transition point.

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,100
And I talked about this on yesterday's Q&A, but just for those of you

45
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,100
who didn't see that, what you'll see is, there's a brief kind of

46
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,700
flash, right?

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,000
It doesn't just like cut cleanly from one to the other.

48
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,900
And so the question is like what's going on there, right?

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,700
And what's going on there is we again, use an on-demand paged assets?

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,100
Them.

51
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,900
So what happens is we dynamically load everything in the background

52
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,300
off the hard drive and especially on this with you.

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,300
This is a 7200 RPM hard drive that's going to be kind of slow.

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
Although it's probably mostly in the cache at this point.

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,400
But either way point being it's kind of slow to page those things in

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,500
it.

57
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,100
Sees it's at least going to take a frame or two of latency for the

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,900
asset systems threads to go.

59
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,600
Grab those other images off of the hard drive and put them into memory

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
where we can draw from them.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,200
Right?

62
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
And so what we want to do is

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,700
We want to try and solve that sort of glitchy problem so that we don't

64
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,700
get any errors in there.

65
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,300
And you know, one way to solve this obviously is just to have a big

66
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,400
old loading screen you slap in front of everything and you just do

67
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,900
this whole loading thing and you waste a bunch of memory.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,900
And blah, blah, blah.

69
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
But we don't want to do that.

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,900
No loading screens on handmade hero.

71
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,400
Preferably, we want everything to be instant soon as the user clicks.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,500
It's good to go, right?

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,400
That's our preference.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,800
And so what I'd like to do is I'd like to have an alternative to that,

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,700
okay.

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,500
So let's start by start by talking about like what that problem

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
actually is.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
In practice here, right?

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
So here we go.

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,300
I'm going to try and sort of show you.

81
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,400
In fact you're not the best place to do.

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,300
This is probably in the debugger, right?

83
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,300
So let's just take a look as this will happen.

84
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,600
Even the very first time we do render cut seam and so here's the

85
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,300
problem, right?

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,800
We come into the first time we do rendered, cutscene and we have

87
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,600
rendered layered seen there so you can see it.

88
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,100
And if I step into render layered scene, we're going to go through

89
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,900
each layer index.

90
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,200
We're going to pull them out, and then we're going to see in each one

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
of these, we're going to see

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,300
You know what, what that bitmap actually is and you can see that we

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,300
get back the bitmap ID here and that's all working properly because

94
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,500
that's all stuff that happens.

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,000
Just using sort of the, if you want to enough directories right turn.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,800
But basically the database, the table, the data table for our asset

97
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,700
system, which can instantly answer these queries.

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,300
So we asked me initially get back.

99
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,100
Oh, that's asset 251.

100
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,500
That you were looking for, so then we go to render with asset 251,

101
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,200
right?

102
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,500
Of course, we got to pack up some, some floats, some factors there.

103
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,500
And so we come in here and we call get bitmap with that ID.

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,400
Now get bitmap.

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Of course, is just going to ask the asset loader for that thing.

106
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,600
It comes in here and as you can see, it immediately fails to actually

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
get it because it's not there, right?

108
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,400
It hasn't been loaded yet that asset state is not is not set, right?

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,800
And you can see, if you look at the state here, the state set to 0.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,300
So it's like, okay, that's not good.

111
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Because we can't actually get it now.

112
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,400
It'll go ahead and say, oh, you know, that's okay, I'll issue a

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,200
command to load that bitmap, so the bitmap will get loaded, right?

114
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,600
But what that means is now when this Frame goes off to render, it's

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,300
just missing that bitmap and that's the entirety of the problem right

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:08,700
there.

117
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,800
It's just that when we ask for the bitmap oak, it's like, okay, thanks

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,400
for telling me.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,400
I got to go load that, that frame, even if we're able to have like a

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
really short turnaround from the drive.

121
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,100
That frame is going to finish rendering before the drive ever, gets

122
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,800
back to us with that data, right?

123
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
That's just an even.

124
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,800
If it got back sooner, we've already made the decision that it's not

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,500
there and we're already not going to render it, right?

126
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,400
So we basically have to solve that problem.

127
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,400
So what I want to do to solve that problem is very simple.

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,500
It's called a prefetch.

129
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,100
What I want to do is I want to give the assets system, a little bit of

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
extra time because especially in a cutscene there's really no excuse

131
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,900
for not doing so because you know, we know exactly what assets are

132
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,400
going to get used in the cutscene +.

133
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,100
We know exactly when they're going to get used so there's really no

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,700
excuse for us.

135
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:58,800
Not

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,800
You know, sort of like, announcing if you will to the asset system.

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Hey, man, here's what you're going to need very shortly.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,800
Get those loads in flight for me, please.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Right.

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,600
And that's really, I think all will probably have to do.

141
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,600
The first thing that I want to do, though is, I'd like to get this

142
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,000
playing back at an artificially fast rate, just so we can see it

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,100
happen a little more clearly.

144
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,800
Okay, so here is US advancing the cutscene at a much more rapid rate

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,800
than we would have otherwise, right?

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So here is a zipping through the cutscene, right?

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,700
And you can see that blinking happening at various times, they're

148
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,400
right?

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,400
So that's all nice and good and you know, you can see that kind of

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,400
little Flicker and so we want to do is get rid of that little flicker.

151
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,100
Okay?

152
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,200
So to get rid of that little flicker, what am I going to do?

153
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
How am I going to do this prefetch?

154
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Well if you'll notice, we kind of have a nice thing here where we can

155
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,800
just go through and say oh he render this cutscene and we give it a

156
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,900
cut scene time and it does some stuff, right?

157
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,800
And the entirety of this routine is actually very simple.

158
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,200
There's not a lot to it, it's all pretty easy.

159
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,800
There's not, you know, there really isn't a whole lot that needs to

160
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,500
happen there.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,700
And so what I could do right is I could just render the cutscene twice

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,700
if I wanted to and and basically the first one that, you know, the one

163
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,800
that we're actually going to render can be at the current time, but

164
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,500
then it's pretty free for me to just render another cutscene at a

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,200
future time.

166
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,100
And instead of ever actually asking it to commit, those bitmaps, I

167
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,400
could just throw it away after that, right?

168
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
It's because basically, you know, remember we do the render group

169
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,600
stuff, we build up a render list and then we ask it to render it

170
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,400
during that build-up process is when all those load cues happen.

171
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,500
If at the end instead I just said, throw it away, then we would get a

172
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,400
pre-caching for free, right?

173
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,000
So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
I'm just going to create a thing here.

175
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,500
That's like sort of a subset of this function.

176
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,100
Maybe I won't call this pretty stupid anymore, but I'll say like

177
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,000
cupcake seeing complete, for example, like so.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Right.

179
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
And so, what I'm going to do is just say, alright, let's move this

180
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,300
part out here.

181
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,200
And there we go.

182
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,400
Maybe I'll return that.

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,900
And I'm going to do like render cutscene you know at time or something

184
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,299
like this.

185
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,600
I don't know what I'm going to call it.

186
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,500
It's basically just an internal function to the cutscene system.

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,100
That doesn't that?

188
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,200
No one else really needs to call?

189
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,900
So the name of it's not too sensitive is not going to leak out in

190
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,500
anything.

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,600
Hopefully and so then we'll just have exactly this function

192
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,500
essentially the exact same function, right?

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,900
That's just render cutscene.

194
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,000
Oops,

195
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,300
At time, okay.

196
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,700
And that's, you know, that's it.

197
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,200
So once we've got that set and I'm going to go ahead and return that

198
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,700
from here, cutscene complete.

199
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,500
Now, we're just going to take it so that it just takes an R32 there.

200
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
It doesn't take a pointer in Marquez, this one's not supposed to

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
modify that value.

202
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,400
So, now, we just have a way of rendering cutscenes at times.

203
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,300
We could do that multiple times if we want to, we can do as many as we

204
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,900
want.

205
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,800
And so if we do something like that, now we have the option just gotta

206
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
do reference that

207
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,400
Now we have the option of potentially doing it twice, right?

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,200
So this is the one that actually renders the cutscene it's free for me

209
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
to do another one here.

210
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,800
Where I just say oh let's go ahead and look maybe like a half second

211
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,500
into the future or maybe a whole second into the future, right?

212
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,300
And then we can render to whole cutscenes.

213
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,800
Now, the problem with this, if I were to just do it this would solve

214
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,500
our problem.

215
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,700
But the problem with this right here is it would actually save all of

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,600
those drawing commands, right?

217
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,300
And we don't actually want it to do that.

218
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
At so we have two choices.

219
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,400
We can either call the prefetch directly if we wanted to meaning in

220
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,100
rendered layered scene right here, where we do this push bitmap, we

221
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,700
could choose to actually have that actually switch to calling prefetch

222
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,100
right.

223
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,800
That's totally valid thing to do.

224
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,300
We could do that or the other thing we can do like I said is just have

225
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,400
a stream and throw it away and so I'm not sure which one of those

226
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,900
would be the easier one to do.

227
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,900
Here is a trick.

228
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm going to try right now.

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know if this is a particularly good idea but let's try it.

230
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass

231
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
With my render group.

232
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,200
Right.

233
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
And what I'm going to do here is anywhere that the rendered group gets

234
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,700
used, which is just like inside the perspective statement there, I'm

235
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,500
going to try just saying, oh, okay.

236
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Well let's just only say, you know, if we were going to do you know,

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
sort of this render group stuff, right?

238
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,500
So I just do if render group, then we do this stuff.

239
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Otherwise, we will only ever.

240
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,000
And in fact, I can do this up here as well, right?

241
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,300
If we didn't have a render group will,

242
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
To a prefetch.

243
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,300
Now I don't know if I love this idea, but it does mean that we don't

244
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
waste any memory.

245
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Like, you know, building up the list that we're going to throw away.

246
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,900
So again, like I said, I don't really know if I like that or not but

247
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,800
I'm just going to try that at first because it seems like the easiest

248
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,400
thing to do.

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,500
So I'm going to try that first and see if I like that.

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,100
So there we go, that's really it.

251
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,500
That's the entirety of it.

252
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,100
And so now all we're doing is we're calling the exact same function

253
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,300
twice one with a

254
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,600
Right.

255
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Look ahead.

256
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
Write about a second of look ahead.

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,400
And when we do that render cutscene at time, it's going to check to

258
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,500
see if the render group was set to 0.

259
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,200
And if the render group is set to 0, it knows that it's not really

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,900
rendering.

261
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,300
It's actually just prefetching, right?

262
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,800
And so now, let's see how that works and see, if that gets rid of our

263
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,100
glitchy, right?

264
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,800
And it does, you'll notice there's no glitching anymore on.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,300
Have you seen transitions, right?

266
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,000
They're all just totally set and that's because now we've given the

267
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,100
streaming system enough time to catch up, although I did see one

268
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
there, right at the beginning one.

269
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,400
And there's a very good reason for that one as well.

270
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,600
And we should talk about that because we do want to fix that one

271
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,200
although we don't care about looping.

272
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,700
Since we're never going to Loop the cutscene we do, we do care about

273
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,700
it for a slightly separate reason.

274
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,300
So first let me ask, do you guys know why there's one on the

275
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:29,700
beginning?

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,100
One.

277
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Right.

278
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,300
And you know, if you think about it, you should be able to figure out

279
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,000
why we have none on anywhere except that beginning one.

280
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,100
So, think about that for a second, one, two three.

281
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,400
Okay.

282
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Times up, the reason is because when we are looking ahead, we don't

283
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,700
rap.

284
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,400
So when we get to the end of the cutscene, it's not going to go back

285
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
to the first one because remember the code that makes it loop around

286
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,500
is right here and that doesn't ever happen inside render cutscene it

287
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,600
time, right?

288
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,600
So it never asks for that you know when surrendering the last cutscene

289
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,100
it never looks ahead into the the first cutscene, but that's actually

290
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,900
okay because normally we would not be looping it so we really don't

291
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,200
have to fix that problem.

292
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,300
But the problem that we do want to fix is this right here that first

293
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,600
time it comes up we would rather not have that happen, right?

294
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,700
And so I think what we want to do there is because if this is the very

295
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,300
first thing you see in the game there's nothing we can look ahead from

296
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,400
We're

297
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,200
Starting up, we got to start rendering.

298
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,900
So typically what I do because the, you know, the streaming systems

299
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,400
always trying to run a little ahead of everything else, but at the

300
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,800
very start of the program, there's no way it could be a head.

301
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,200
So what I usually do is basically like the loading screen that I have

302
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,700
if you will, he's just to give it maybe just like 100 milliseconds or

303
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,200
200 milliseconds of black, right.

304
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,600
Just like a quick little black screen on boot so that it has enough

305
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,500
time to be loading ahead, right?

306
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,000
And so, what I would say here is just say, okay, you know, we would

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,100
just do something like this where a just be like there's nothing in

308
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
this scene at all.

309
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,500
Like at all, at all.

310
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,400
I think there's a nun.

311
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,900
Is there a nun?

312
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,900
Yeah.

313
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,800
So there's absolutely nothing in it and there's no actual like

314
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,700
anything, right?

315
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,500
There is no, it's just a bunch of 0, right?

316
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,900
Something like that.

317
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,500
And so now we could have this thing have a duration.

318
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
So we could say, oh, when we do, you know, when we do our asset none

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and all this sort of thing.

320
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,000
So it's 0, 0 0, and then we would put a duration here, right?

321
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
If we wanted to, we could have like a big old

322
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,800
In their summer, right?

323
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Wait, a minute is that the right one for it asset opening?

324
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,300
Cutscene is asset none.

325
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,100
Then we have index, then we have a red count through intro layers.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yeah, so I think

327
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,100
I think that would be correct.

328
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,300
Let me see if I can put a big old delay in there too, so I can make

329
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,100
sure it's actually there.

330
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh,

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,600
right.

332
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,000
We're never using that one.

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:27,900
There we go.

334
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,300
So now there should be a delay in there, right?

335
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
So perfect.

336
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,500
We now have a delay in there and so now all we need to do is make sure

337
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,000
that we have enough of a delay so that it can load things, which it

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,600
should be reasonably good with I think, but we don't really know like

339
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,700
how long that load, how long the loading time actually is for our

340
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,900
assets, if that makes sense.

341
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,500
So let's take a look at what that would actually have to be.

342
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm going to turn it back now so that it doesn't do sort of the blitz

343
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
thing that makes sense.

344
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
Let's see here.

345
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,400
Let us see here.

346
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,100
If I can manage to search for it, here we go.

347
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,600
So we're back to our normal time.

348
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,200
Then this would, of course be what 20 seconds would course be too

349
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,500
long.

350
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,800
So, you know, we'll see, I don't know, Force lowered.

351
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It was, you know, even just one second just seems like a long time,

352
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,300
right?

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
That didn't seem like one second to me.

354
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
But I guess it was.

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
So now we don't get that blink at the start up because we get in the

356
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,500
streaming system enough time to load everything in which is what we

357
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,100
wanted.

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,500
And yeah, that might take some tuning.

359
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,400
We could also do something where we wait intentionally to make sure

360
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,500
that everything's loaded.

361
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,700
But again, that's not necessarily, you know, we don't really probably

362
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,600
have to do that.

363
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
We could wait a little bit longer because I don't know why it seems so

364
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,800
fast.

365
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,600
It might be that.

366
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,800
It's just because it takes a while to get everything started up.

367
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,200
But it's like, before I can even maximize the darn thing off it goes.

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,300
Under do we have a way to start up in full screen mode?

369
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,800
I don't remember if we do or not, I might enjoy that for the moment.

370
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,800
Let's see here.

371
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,000
Toggle full screen.

372
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's see.

373
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,700
Toggle full screen.

374
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,700
All right, so if I wanted to do that, I suppose after we did our

375
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,400
create window, I could toggle full screen on it, right?

376
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,100
If I wanted to.

377
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,500
So I could do it, like, right here.

378
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,500
There we go.

379
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,900
So, yeah.

380
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,300
So there's still, there's a little craftiness in that, there's that,

381
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,300
that white sort of annoying thing there that we see when we boot up.

382
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,400
And that's probably something, it would be nice to get rid of, as

383
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,900
well, maybe we could do that today.

384
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,200
But now, we've got it.

385
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
So that now, you know, once.

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,100
Explain the cutscenes.

387
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,100
There's none of those little glitches, right and especially when it's

388
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,300
playing it sort of a nice leisurely Pace here.

389
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,300
Then you know that you're not going to get any you know the streaming

390
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,900
setup systems.

391
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Got a full second or whatever.

392
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,900
I look ahead, time is right, to take care of that and maybe a second

393
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,000
isn't as much as we should give it because it could, we could give it

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
a lot more than that, right?

395
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
We could give it a significantly more than that.

396
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,100
We could say something like.

397
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
Oh, you know,

398
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,700
Cutscene warmup time, right?

399
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,300
And we could say that that's or warm-up seconds or something like that

400
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,500
and then we could just use that in both places.

401
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,600
We could say well will show nothing for a certain amount of that and

402
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,400
then will, you know, will look ahead by that amount as well.

403
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
So now we know we're always have like sort of a prefetch cursor in a

404
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,500
regular cursor kind of running through it, right?

405
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,200
And hey, you know, that's going to bug me.

406
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,700
So I'm going to go ahead and say, let's just get rid of that.

407
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,800
Annoying thing to.

408
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,600
So there's two things that we have to do.

409
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,400
The first one is for our render group.

410
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know that our render group ever gets actually cleared.

411
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
I don't know that there's a clear in our in our thing.

412
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,500
There might be, I'm not sure, but if we do begin render.

413
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Yeah, I don't think there is.

414
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,300
So what we want to do is we're going to need a thing where we clear

415
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,100
the render group.

416
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Now, normally we won't have to clear it because normally

417
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:31,300
When we're rendering the scene, we don't the layers of cells like

418
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:31,800
clear it right?

419
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
You know, which we draw the whole screen so we don't have to worry.

420
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,400
But what would happen is if there are no layers, if it's a layer count

421
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,300
of zero then we have a problem, right?

422
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,300
So what we would want to do is say like if the scene layer count

423
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,100
equals zero, then we would want to make sure we issue a clear and I'm

424
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
going to go ahead and see just a leave it gray.

425
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,400
So we can see that it's actually

426
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Dang it.

427
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,000
So there we go right?

428
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,800
And so that's nice because then we can make sure that we're actually

429
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,200
clearing to Black during our sort of blackout startup period and that

430
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,900
way everything is nice and nice and clean.

431
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,000
So there we go.

432
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,300
And you know it kind of starts the thing and it'll go from there,

433
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,200
okay?

434
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,100
And so now, what I want to do is I want to get rid of those that

435
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,500
little.

436
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,300
I don't like that, flicker that white Flickr.

437
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,800
So I need to drop back to the win32 platform layer and figure out why

438
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,300
that's happening right now in our wa.

439
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm paint.

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,500
We do this.

441
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,900
Win 32 display buffer in window thing.

442
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,700
But you can kind of see what happens here that does.

443
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,900
This kind of stretch GI B thing and I've worried that we'd never

444
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,600
initialize that buffer.

445
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't know if that's the case but I suspect we don't.

446
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,200
In fact you can kind of see Ho Hey look at that probably clear this to

447
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,800
Black.

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
Yeah, probably.

449
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,500
Right.

450
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
And so what we want to do there is when we call that win32 or size dip

451
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,000
section, we want to make sure that we get rid of all of it so that

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,900
it's all cleared to 0, right?

453
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,400
And so you

454
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,900
you know, I think there's

455
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,600
Zero memory.

456
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,700
Call in Windows.

457
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,500
I want to say there is, I don't really remember, but I think so.

458
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:16,600
Might be it might use a c runtime library though I'm not sure yeah

459
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,400
runtime libraries zero memory macro.

460
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,000
What's Phil memory?

461
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:23,800
Wait.

462
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,600
When we virtual Alec though, can't we ask it to give us back

463
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,400
something, that's cleared.

464
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,700
20, isn't there just a way to automatically say, hey, zero, that for

465
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,100
me?

466
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,900
I thought there was

467
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,500
Let's find out.

468
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Occasion type.

469
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,300
Physical.

470
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,900
No.

471
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,900
Zero.

472
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,200
Let's see.

473
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,800
Reserve commits or change the memory allocated.

474
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,500
By this function is automatically initialized to zero, so that all

475
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,400
should have been 0 apparently, right?

476
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,900
So, in theory,

477
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,800
We should never actually have to clear it to Black.

478
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,900
It should already be black, right?

479
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,300
so, I'm just going to say

480
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:36,600
Note, Casey virtual Alec should only have given us back zeroed memory.

481
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,000
Which is all black.

482
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,400
So we don't need to clear it, right?

483
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,400
And then I'm just going to check.

484
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,300
I'm going to check to see if that's actually the case because I don't

485
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,900
know that I necessarily trust msdn all the time, it can be wrong.

486
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,500
It's definitely been wrong before.

487
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,600
Oops.

488
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,900
All right, so I'm going to come in through here and make sure that

489
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,100
buffer memory looks like what we expected to look like.

490
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,500
Here is a memory window.

491
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm going to probably move that up here for now.

492
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
So let's take a look at what buffer memory is first of all.

493
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,100
So there it is.

494
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:34,200
And I'm going to paste it in here to see that looks pretty 0 to me.

495
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,900
I'll give it.

496
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,100
I'll give you that, that looks very 0.

497
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,300
I don't see a lot of nonzero values in there so I'll give you that.

498
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
That's pretty easy Road.

499
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,600
So, the question now is, why are we getting that white that sort of

500
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,800
white nastiness in there, right?

501
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,400
So we got to figure out why that's actually happening.

502
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,100
So when we do toggle full screen, there's a couple things that could

503
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,800
be happening.

504
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,800
First of all, I want to look at our window class because sometimes

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,700
Window class, you might end up with an H brush, that does something

506
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,900
that you don't expect it to do.

507
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,700
It looks like we're setting.

508
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:13,500
Our H brush, like H, redraw CSH redraw CSV redraw.

509
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,200
I wonder if we really want those as well.

510
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,500
I don't really know exactly what we want here because we don't really

511
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,900
want our we want our window to just draw black when it does anything

512
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,600
like that.

513
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,800
So I guess the other thing we could do is initialize it with a black

514
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Brush.

515
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,500
So that it always did that for us whenever it repainted the window.

516
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
I really don't know.

517
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,300
This is one of those ones where you kind of want Raymond Chen, just

518
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,100
say what's the simplest set of things we can do to make sure it stays

519
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,200
black and never draws anything else, right?

520
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,500
And it's hard to know because we can't step through it.

521
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,700
We can step through their code in C, so, hbr background, right is one

522
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,400
example, and this is a handle to the class background brush.

523
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,600
So we could, for example, make a brush that was just all black right

524
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,300
and set that and see if that helped at all.

525
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,900
So, let's see if that helps at all, if we do hbr.

526
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,800
Background.

527
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,500
Let's see if we do hbr background, we would need.

528
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,900
Like I don't know how I do an RGB brush RGB brush.

529
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,100
I forget all this stuff.

530
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,000
It's been a long time but if I want to handle to a brush, that's just

531
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
that's just RGB.

532
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,100
Well, how do I do this again?

533
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,700
Let's see, here create pen.

534
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,200
Set PK color, so wrecked

535
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
CPK color is not really what I wanted.

536
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,600
I wanted an actual brush, I think get stock objects, should give one

537
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,000
to me now that I think about it.

538
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,500
This is just my memory of Windows kind of coming back kind of slowly.

539
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,300
There it is.

540
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,100
So that's what I actually just want.

541
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,400
It's get stock object black brush, so we should be able to say, okay

542
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,900
here's a black brush to use, have fun with that.

543
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Trust me, it's an inch brush, you know.

544
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,300
Windows, don't worry about it.

545
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,800
Let's see if that helps.

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey, look, perfect.

547
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,900
So now we got rid of that kind of annoying white thing there that was

548
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,100
kind of, I assume that was just Windows, either, not clearing anything

549
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,400
or clearing us to White because it thought that's what it should do.

550
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,300
For some reason, I'm not sure.

551
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,500
But now we have a really nice startup experience the user pushes run,

552
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,300
and it's pretty good.

553
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,000
There they're still occasionally.

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll see a little bit of a window wipe their which is doesn't Thrill

555
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,500
Me.

556
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
And I'm not sure.

557
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm going to do something more like this.

558
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,800
I might create the window without it being visible first, so that you

559
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,700
can't see it.

560
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,100
And then we'll create it, visible will make it visible later.

561
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,400
And so, I don't know if any of these set WS visible.

562
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,900
I don't think they do.

563
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,800
So when we do it,

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Go full screen will then cure do show window SW show, think that's the

565
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,700
right command for it to like instead of having it come up as visible

566
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
with the use, default stuff.

567
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,700
I'm gonna first, Let It Go full screen, then show it so that you don't

568
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,700
see any flashing.

569
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,700
So that's

570
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,400
that's way better than it was.

571
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,500
All right, so that feels pretty good to me.

572
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
I think that's that's doable.

573
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,500
So I'm pretty happy with that.

574
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,300
All right.

575
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,600
So it's 5:30 now.

576
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
We still have another half an hour.

577
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,800
So we've got our cutscene playing pretty nicely here.

578
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,300
I think the next thing that we want to do there's kind of this kind of

579
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,700
you know, two directions here.

580
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,300
So one thing that we want to do to finish this cutscene is we'd want

581
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,400
to sync it to an intro soundtrack, but we don't have an interest on

582
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
track yet so that's why we're not going to go do that.

583
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,700
that be, you know, we could go, we fix the win32 timing code to be

584
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,300
nice and

585
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,500
Consistent.

586
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,400
And then we would go ahead and sink it to some kind of a time, you

587
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,900
know, sort of go line it up to where in the sound we wanted each sort

588
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,200
of cut to occur and how long we wanted each sort of Zoom thing to

589
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,000
take, right?

590
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,900
But we can't do that.

591
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So the other thing that I think we should probably do is just pop back

592
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
to the game code now and start to sort of structure our game code in

593
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
order to have an intro cutscene, right?

594
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,300
Because really, we're going to need some way of having the intro

595
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,500
cutscene play in the gameplay and that sort of stuff.

596
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,700
So we need some kind of a piece of code, you know, something that sits

597
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,100
there and can be logical about what it is.

598
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,700
We're doing, are we playing the cutscene are we playing the game?

599
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,900
Are we doing, you know, are we in some kind of a selection screen, you

600
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,000
know?

601
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,500
Who knows what's happening, right?

602
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,000
So let's let's go ahead and look at that and that seems like the most

603
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,700
productive use of the half hour since we can't really sink to a

604
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,300
timeline.

605
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,300
We don't really have one yet.

606
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,400
Now, there's not much to that.

607
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
Like I said, it's pretty straightforward because we set up everything

608
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,800
in our handmade cutscenes thing to work that way.

609
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,100
So you know, if we if just to give you an idea of what we would do,

610
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,800
it's really simple.

611
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,100
All we be doing is tuning these durations.

612
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,200
So that instead of each thing taking 20 seconds, it takes however long

613
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,500
we actually wanted to take right, you know, if we once we sort of take

614
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,700
a look at how long the intro track is, and where we think the brakes

615
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:36,700
would?

616
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Naturally go.

617
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,300
We would just literally set these values and then we could play the

618
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,300
cutscene and the music at the same time and we would probably be good

619
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
to go right from there.

620
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Because again, we don't have anything here that has to be like, super

621
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,100
sample.

622
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,000
Accurate, this isn't like a beat matching game or anything, so we only

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,300
care and there isn't lip-syncing either, right?

624
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,200
It's just still images.

625
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,000
So we don't even really have a whole lot of precision concerns.

626
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,900
So even anywhere.

627
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Close is actually fine.

628
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,500
So it's pretty easy for us to just tune those values and that's

629
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,600
probably all we really need to do, right.

630
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,300
Okay, so let's take a look back at handmade dot CPP.

631
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,300
And so what I want to do here I guess is I want to just start sort of

632
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,000
thinking about how we deal with the game itself and the fact that this

633
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,400
is going to be an attract mode thing.

634
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,200
And then somebody at some point starts playing the game, right?

635
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,400
And we already sort of have that concept because if you remember, if I

636
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,700
switch this around, right, if I switch this back so that instead of

637
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,600
these instead of the cutscene, we're actually doing the game itself.

638
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,500
We already sort of had this concept right here is our, like, here's

639
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,300
our screen.

640
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,400
Here's our hero screen.

641
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,200
You know, our first, you know, dummy screen or whatever and the heroes

642
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,900
not on it yet, right?

643
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,400
And the hero, in fact, doesn't show up until I actually push a key to

644
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
sort of say that, hey, I'm playing a hero now, right?

645
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
And the reason we did that, I don't have a controller right here, but

646
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,700
way back when it's, because you can have multiple heroes in the game,

647
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,100
right?

648
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,100
And that's not, you know, the game's not really supposed to be me.

649
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Player.

650
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
But we want to make sure the code supports multiplayer.

651
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,700
Just so I can show how you make sure you can do that relatively clean

652
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:16,800
lie.

653
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Right.

654
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,000
And so what we, you know what we have there is we have already the

655
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,300
concept that such that the game gets started right on that.

656
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,200
When you push that spacebar, the game gets started.

657
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,500
And so, what I want to do is I want to sort of turn from having it

658
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,800
show this empty screen to perhaps showing that, like, let that

659
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,700
cutscene until you start the game.

660
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,700
That seems like a way better.

661
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,900
That seems like a way better idea to me, right?

662
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,000
Yeah, that seems like a good thing and that will also inform how we

663
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,400
want to do our sort of what's the word I'm looking for.

664
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,500
That can also inform how we might want to do our pinging like our

665
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,200
prefetch from the outside because we made that may have ramifications

666
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,300
for like how we say oh hey start prefetching assets or whatever,

667
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,900
right?

668
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,400
So let's see.

669
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,600
Hmm, you're enjoying on.

670
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,700
That is true.

671
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,000
It's a bit Jani.

672
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
so what I want to do here is I want to be able to switch between these

673
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,600
two and so what I think I might do is say okay,

674
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,900
This needs to be a dynamic variable for start, right?

675
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,100
So it's playing the cutscene or doing whatever, but we need some way

676
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,800
of testing it.

677
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,400
Now, what I could do is say, are there any heroes in the game?

678
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,800
You know what I mean?

679
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,900
And we have a thing that's like controlled Heroes, right?

680
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,200
And we Loop over it too.

681
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,900
And we say, like, for each controlled hero, we actually see, you know,

682
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,100
is there an entity index for this thing or whatever?

683
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,700
So we could even do a thing that's like Heroes exist or

684
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,700
Right?

685
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,200
And we could say that if we find one of these ones, then the hero does

686
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,000
in fact exist, right?

687
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,400
So, we could say something like, oh, here exist equals true, if that

688
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
happens, right?

689
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,700
And so, if we did that,

690
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,800
Then we could just say o Heroes exists is the thing that we switch on.

691
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,600
And so then we'd start off or or not because actually you have to make

692
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,300
sure that your cases are going the right order.

693
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,900
That's good, let's try again.

694
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,400
Then we start off playing the cutscene right and it'll just keep

695
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,500
playing the cutscene until eventually We join the game and then once

696
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,100
we join the game, we're in the game right now.

697
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
You can see that we've got sort of another like

698
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,600
Like issue that we probably have to address.

699
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
This is probably not the right time to address it because the game

700
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,400
itself you'd want to do this.

701
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,700
A little later on when the game itself is kind of more of a complete

702
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,000
game.

703
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,700
Like more, when you're more like walking around, fighting some

704
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,100
enemies, doing a few more things where you actually have that

705
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,200
structure, kind of more in place rather than just a little test thing.

706
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,400
But the idea there is just that, hey, you need to prefetch the assets

707
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,500
for the game as well, because, as you can see, you know, we're in

708
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,100
here.

709
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,800
And we're kind of doing our thing and then as soon as I hit the key,

710
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
it switches and you're playing.

711
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,600
But the assets may not have book we loaded yet you see like a partial

712
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,400
screen or whatever.

713
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,800
So that's another thing that we would want to do but I don't really

714
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,300
want to mess with that yet.

715
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,500
I wanted to make sure it was done for the cutscenes because there's no

716
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,400
reason not to if the cutscenes but I don't want to do it for the game.

717
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,100
This early.

718
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay.

719
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,900
So now that we've got the cutscene working and we can start enjoying

720
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,600
now.

721
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,199
We've kind of got a start, we've got to sort of think about a few more

722
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,600
things like how we want to deal.

723
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,600
Other aspects of what's going on, right?

724
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,100
And the reason for that is once I'm in a game, I can't necessarily get

725
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,800
out of a game.

726
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,500
Like I can't hit Escape or something and go back.

727
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,700
Like I can't quit right, I can't exit or anything.

728
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,100
So we may want to actually have a way to like exit handmade hero.

729
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,500
Start to think about that a little bit and I don't know.

730
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,400
How we want to do that.

731
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Exactly.

732
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
But one example would be like, we have the concept of a back button.

733
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,900
I don't know if the back button, let me see where that was back

734
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,700
button.

735
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,200
What do we set that to keyboard wise?

736
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I don't know.

737
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
Arrow back.

738
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,900
So it is a to escape.

739
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,600
So what we could do is when you hit the back button, you just go back,

740
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
you can just exit out of the game that way.

741
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,700
Right.

742
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's let's see about something like that.

743
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,200
So, if we want to do that, what we would do is we would I guess our

744
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,100
entity system.

745
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,400
You can kind of see when we do our add player here, right?

746
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
We have no real way of undoing, any of that.

747
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,000
It'd be nice to maybe start to, to fix that a little bit.

748
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
So let's, let's see what we can do.

749
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,600
Let's see what we can do there.

750
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,200
So if I'm going through my controllers here,

751
00:35:59,600 --> 00:35:59,900
and I,

752
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Hit the Escape key.

753
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm going to make it so that that just straight-up gets rid of the

754
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,000
player entirely, right?

755
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,700
So, if the controller

756
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,900
Back-ended down.

757
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm going to say that the con hero

758
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,900
Entity and x equals 0.

759
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,900
And I'd like to be able to delete this entity, right?

760
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,000
I'd like to be able to like delete low entity.

761
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,600
Do we have such a thing?

762
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I don't even know.

763
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,900
Because we haven't really worked very much on that part of the game.

764
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,800
So we've got Get Low entity.

765
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,100
We have like a bad player.

766
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,300
I don't know what that actually does is, it says it does add ground

767
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,400
identity, right?

768
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,300
And so, do we have delete entity?

769
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,200
Anywhere.

770
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,200
We have delete low entity anywhere, so we don't have any way to remove

771
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,700
entities but that be a fair assessment.

772
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,200
It appears that that would be a fair assessment.

773
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,000
So we would want to have a way to delete any of these to be sure.

774
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,700
Right.

775
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,300
I mean, at least I assume we do one way of doing it would be to not

776
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,700
ever really

777
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Do that and to just like kind of cycle them, but so how does that

778
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,400
actually work here?

779
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,200
So we just add any of these to the state incrementally over time.

780
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,100
So really just a simple free list, like we've been using everywhere,

781
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,500
else will be totally fine here.

782
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,600
So instead of at, you know, allocating a new one every time, it could

783
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:30,000
just go ahead and yeah and and and and keep it free list, that seems

784
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,700
pretty reasonable to me.

785
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,500
Yeah, so let's go ahead and do that.

786
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,100
For the time being and we'll just say, okay, there's an index right of

787
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,800
that thing.

788
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,100
And in there we will do a little like to do, you know, actually delete

789
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,800
or something like this and we'll be fine.

790
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,700
Okay, so in theory, we're calling it and I gotta pass the game state

791
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,300
to that.

792
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,400
As well.

793
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,300
Okay, so now in theory, if I create one of these guys and I walk them

794
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,500
around, I should be able to kill him and go back to the cutscene right

795
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,900
and I should be able to let create them again and go and you can see

796
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,000
these not actually deleted right there.

797
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,500
He is.

798
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:32,700
And yeah so you know proof that he's still in the world and so I can

799
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,600
keep doing this as much as I want and make more and more Heroes.

800
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,000
Course, they're all like stuck in each other's Collision boxes right

801
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,700
now because they're spawning right on top of each other which is not a

802
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,400
very good thing but you get the idea.

803
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,700
So we're all good there.

804
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,300
I think so.

805
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,700
Now I should probably just Implement that.

806
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,400
Although the thing that I want to do before I Implement that is Maybe

807
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,800
maybe say something like if you were to try and

808
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Exit the game.

809
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:09,600
So if you were to save this where this thing ended down,

810
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,100
then maybe we exit the game.

811
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:16,900
Right.

812
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,000
So you know, like quit requested.

813
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,400
Like this and then if no Heroes exist and the quit was requested then

814
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,800
we would say like hey that's it for the game's over.

815
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900
Right stop.

816
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,500
And so I don't really know how we want a signal quitting.

817
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,300
I assume that what we'd want to do is have that be in something that

818
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,200
we pass back to the game to the platform code because it's the thing

819
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,000
that needs to do shut down, right?

820
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,600
And so in order for that to work, we would need to do a thing where

821
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:53,700
like

822
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, we would need to do a thing.

823
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We're inside the code here, there was something it could look at,

824
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,600
right?

825
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
So in the weren't 32 platform section.

826
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,200
When we're doing sort of our thing, we've got Global running.

827
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,400
And you can kind of see that Global running is set by some platform

828
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,900
stuff so we can hit alt f4 to let kill the game or whatever and that's

829
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,600
all good.

830
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,200
But

831
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,700
We don't really have any way of sort of having the game.

832
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,600
Do the quit, you know what I mean?

833
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So, what we want to do, I think is we want to go ahead and grab that

834
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,300
from the game itself.

835
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,700
So we want to do something we're in here, as we're sort of going

836
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,200
through, whatever is happening at the end or rather.

837
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:42,000
After we do update and render, let's go ahead and get updates and

838
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,000
render groups after we call game update and render.

839
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,100
I

840
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,100
Do you want to do is say that Global running you know is going to get

841
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:59,700
set to false if you know the game indicates to us that that should

842
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,100
happen.

843
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:06,100
So maybe we do something like this where we say oh if if there was a

844
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,800
quit requested you know then we'll go ahead and do that.

845
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,400
Now I would probably do that here and I'd say like okay if Heroes if

846
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,500
the heroes exist

847
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
If no Heroes exist.

848
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,300
Then if equipped was requested, then I'll just say, like memory quit

849
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,600
requested equals true and that'll end the game, right?

850
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,100
I could do it like, right here, even

851
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,800
Something like that.

852
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,500
And so that's just a way of exiting out.

853
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,000
That means we will need some Jimmy.

854
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,900
In the platform layer will need some way that it can that it can sort

855
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
of signal that back.

856
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:55,000
And this is like note Casey signals back to the platform layer and so

857
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,800
that would be be through to quit requested and that should be fine.

858
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,100
I think right now I'm going to take a look and went through two,

859
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:04,800
handmade.

860
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,700
I just want to make sure that we when we initialize game memory that

861
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,400
we initialize the whole thing, 20.

862
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,700
And I don't know if we do, we do.

863
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,900
So, there we go.

864
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,600
So now I should be able to if I'm watching the cutscene I should be

865
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,600
able to quit the game.

866
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I can I should be able to go in here.

867
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,900
I should be able to go back.

868
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,100
Boo that quit the game even though Heroes existed.

869
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Why is that?

870
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,200
Why?

871
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,900
Oh, I see why we never give it a chance to reset the Escape key.

872
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,500
So it's kind of like on the first frame, it goes.

873
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,200
Oh I should kill this hero on the second frame.

874
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,900
Right it exits out of the menu entirely.

875
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,100
So that's a key that's going to have to be D bounced, right?

876
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,400
Meaning.

877
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Like or that we have to check for it.

878
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,000
Going down in up again, right?

879
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,200
And so yeah, I feel like we would need to do more of a

880
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,300
I guess we could do it was pressed, that would probably be fine.

881
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,500
Let's take a look here.

882
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:11,500
Oops.

883
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,900
So, we could probably just do this, right?

884
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
We could say was pressed that

885
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,500
Like so.

886
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,500
And was pressed.

887
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
And that may be it.

888
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,000
So, there's regular exit.

889
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,900
There's two step exit and then we're good.

890
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,300
So at least now we can like get into the game we can get out of the

891
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,000
game and that gives us a little bit more of a sort of solid thing

892
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,600
happening there.

893
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,500
But of course we also don't really have any logic for our cutscene.

894
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,100
So, what we want to do now is I think probably have a little bit more

895
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:11,600
of a formal idea of what's happening with the cutscenes, they probably

896
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,400
shouldn't have, you know, something where it's just this random thing

897
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,600
in the middle of game State.

898
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,400
That's like, oh,

899
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,200
The cut T, cutscene right.

900
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,700
So I think we want to try and make the cut scene a little bit more of

901
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,800
a thing so that we kind of have a little bit more of an idea of what

902
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,300
it's doing and how and whatever, right?

903
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,200
So I'm going to do a thing here where I just say okay there's such a

904
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,600
thing as a playing cutscene

905
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,600
And that's going to have to Encompass, all of the information that

906
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,300
needs to come to be encompassed by playing cutscene.

907
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,100
And, of course, that's for right now.

908
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,600
Not going to be particularly interesting.

909
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,100
but, you know,

910
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,400
That at least gives us a place to put other things.

911
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,000
Should we decide that we need to do that, right?

912
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
It's true that we probably will want a little bit more information in

913
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,100
there because right now, actually, this stuff is hard coded as

914
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,900
well-meaning the shot index and all that stuff.

915
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,400
So we could also do another thing where we said, okay, there's also,

916
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,500
you know, which one of these it is so, you know, a playing cutscene

917
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,800
could also have something like this.

918
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,000
What are the scenes, right?

919
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
And, and how many are there?

920
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,800
then here's the tea in it so far, so that

921
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,400
That seems a little bit more, little bit more reasonable.

922
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,100
Yeah, so what I'd like to do is then say, okay, you know, we've got

923
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,200
playing cutscene and playing cutscene, maybe is a thing that can be

924
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,000
returned.

925
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,300
So maybe we'll do something like play Intro, cutscene

926
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,900
a rather get intro in Mitchell eyes.

927
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,300
I don't know.

928
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,400
What do I want to call this baby?

929
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,200
Just begin intro cutscene or that suggests.

930
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,100
There's going to be an end.

931
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:09,900
Make intro.

932
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,200
Cutscene not sure.

933
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,400
Right?

934
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,200
So if I do make intro cutscene, then what I can do is just say like

935
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,900
all this information that was there.

936
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,700
I'm going to bake into it.

937
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,400
So I say here's a playing cutscene

938
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,400
That's the result and I'm going to go ahead and initialize it.

939
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:36,900
So we say okay the scene count is this this count

940
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,600
Seems.

941
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,500
Come here.

942
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,000
The tea.

943
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,600
Is just zero point zero that we don't need their size that because

944
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,900
that will happen automatically with this, and then I'm going to return

945
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,200
that.

946
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,700
So, there you go.

947
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,200
So that'll make the intro cutscene.

948
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,000
I don't need to pass anything to it.

949
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,900
Really there's nothing to pass.

950
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,300
And so now I could actually, when we start up the game, have a little

951
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,100
bit more of a concrete thing that says, which is, you know, which one

952
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,800
of these things were playing at the moment.

953
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah.

954
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,400
Yeah.

955
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:23,300
All right so if I do that let's go ahead and now change render

956
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,200
cutscene instead of taking T.

957
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Cutscene I'm going to pass in which cutscene we're talking about and

958
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,600
now this will be like cutscene T, right?

959
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:34,400
And

960
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,600
It'll look more like that.

961
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,600
It'll do actually.

962
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,300
No that's not true.

963
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,500
It'll just pass that straight on in, won't it?

964
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,200
So we'll do render cutting that time will actually take.

965
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah, well actually take both of those.

966
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,100
And so anyway this will actually need to be past the actual cut scene

967
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,000
itself.

968
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,000
So let's go ahead and do that.

969
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,800
Don't know how.

970
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,300
I don't know where I want that past.

971
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,700
That I wanted at the end.

972
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,700
I don't know.

973
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,500
Let's put it there.

974
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:13,700
It's fine.

975
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,500
Don't worry about it.

976
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
All right, so yeah.

977
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,900
Playing cutscene comes in here.

978
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,300
We get it passed in.

979
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,200
We're going to go ahead and use the things that are in that.

980
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:32,900
and,

981
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah.

982
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,900
And now we should be good to go.

983
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,000
We just have to do a little bit of cleanup work surpassing the

984
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,100
cutscene of course.

985
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,200
I always spell it differently because that's just the way I am so

986
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,000
render cutscene that time.

987
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,400
Needs to take that sin T.

988
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,100
Cutscene not at the beginning like so and then this of course would be

989
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:05,500
cutscene oops cut seam tea.

990
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,800
And there we go.

991
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,900
All right, so you're right.

992
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,800
It doesn't have

993
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,000
There we go.

994
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,700
So that seems good that all seems good.

995
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,900
And T, cutscene is not a member of game State.

996
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:24,600
That's correct.

997
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:24,800
Now.

998
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,600
So now what I want to do is where we used to have to cut scene.

999
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,400
I'm just going to have playing cutscene and the current cutscene

1000
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,400
like so.

1001
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,500
So now what I'll do is when we do render cutscene, I'm just going to

1002
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,400
say oh hey this is the current cutscene.

1003
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,300
And what I want to do now is just to initialize that right?

1004
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,100
When we are have not been initialized yet.

1005
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,800
Then what I'm going to do is say, oh hey, yeah, when we initialize the

1006
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,500
game and I need you to make that be an intro cutscene right?

1007
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,900
Alexa.

1008
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:06,600
Before.

1009
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,400
And if I current cutscene missing type specifier into Sumo C++ does

1010
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,400
not support default.

1011
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,000
And

1012
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,100
Yes.

1013
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,500
Well, you know, I mean what do you want from me?

1014
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,000
I didn't Define it because it was in here and, you know, it just

1015
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,200
didn't have the chance.

1016
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,200
So, there you go.

1017
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,700
You know, no need to worry, no, need to freak out compiler.

1018
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,100
All right, so we're going to do a render cutscene here.

1019
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,100
This is just game State current.

1020
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:34,700
Cutscene

1021
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,500
XO T, cutscene, not a member of game State.

1022
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,100
That's unfortunate of course, but not really a problem because we can

1023
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,700
just do like, Advanced cutscene I guess with something like this.

1024
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,900
Now, there is a nastiness here, there is a thing that's kind of

1025
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,400
annoying.

1026
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,800
And that is by doing it this way.

1027
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,500
We do kind of make it a little harder on ourselves because these are

1028
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,000
not going to be hot loadable anymore because they might move if that

1029
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,700
makes sense.

1030
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,700
So, that's kind of annoying, and I don't know if we want to do

1031
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,700
anything to try and fix that.

1032
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:22,500
We don't really have to because we could always make them be in the

1033
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,900
function themselves.

1034
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,300
So there's there's ways we can get around that, but it's worth noting

1035
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,200
that, that may cause us a bit of a problem future.

1036
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,000
And we'll have to see

1037
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:30,700
About it.

1038
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,000
Just in terms of the hot loading of the code since, you know, we baked

1039
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,300
it.

1040
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,800
It's not clear that that's going to matter too much because we're not

1041
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,600
going to be probably fussing with as much, but it's worth noting.

1042
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
That that is a little bit of a problem.

1043
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,500
And so, you know, that's just a limitation of the fact that we don't

1044
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,800
get much support from C4 our heart loading.

1045
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,900
So we can't have stuff like the, the data, you know, get munched

1046
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,500
properly.

1047
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,200
It's it's just a bummer but that's the, you know, the reality of it.

1048
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,700
So anyway so then we just need a way to like Advanced cutscenes and

1049
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,300
time right?

1050
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,500
Again just I had hard coded this but now just making it a little more

1051
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:10,700
formal so that we kind of can have multiple cutscenes.

1052
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,000
Want to and they're not all kind of baked in.

1053
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,600
So here's cutscene, here's DT.

1054
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,400
So cutscene t plus equals DT is all that's going to do nothing this

1055
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,600
point and now we should be back to normal, right?

1056
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,500
So now again we can we can go in, we can come back out and of course,

1057
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,700
what's going to be problematic here is

1058
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,300
When we go into the game like that and come back out, the cutscene

1059
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,400
won't restart and presumably we probably wanted it to.

1060
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,300
We probably will want like a little title screen at some point and

1061
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,400
we'll probably want to restart the cutscene like.

1062
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,900
So we show the title screen for a couple seconds and then we start the

1063
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,200
cutscene or something like that.

1064
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,500
I don't know exactly what we want to do but it'd be something like

1065
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:57,900
that.

1066
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:02,500
But right now what will happen is instead you know, if we let this go

1067
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,100
right, like I wait for a little while you can kind of see the the

1068
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,800
welcome sign right?

1069
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,200
Kind

1070
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
Flowing off to the right there.

1071
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,100
It you know, it's now almost entirely gone as it kind of comes around.

1072
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,800
So if I go into the game and now come back, you can see that's where

1073
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,300
we start again, right?

1074
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,600
So we don't really want that, you know, we want the ability to restart

1075
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,500
instead of it sort of saving that state because presumably, that's

1076
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,800
what we would want to have happen.

1077
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,200
And so, in order to do that, what we'll need to do

1078
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,800
Wait, you know, I should do.

1079
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,700
We break that we did this one.

1080
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,300
Make sure all the forest still worked.

1081
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,600
We verify

1082
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:51,400
So what we want to do is we want to be able to restart the cutscene

1083
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,000
whenever we you know kind of come back.

1084
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
You know, whenever we start the game we want to we want to make sure

1085
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,400
we reset that cutscene right.

1086
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,700
And so in order to do that we need some notion of like when we

1087
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,500
transition.

1088
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,200
And so that's the problem.

1089
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:09,400
Like this is a very clean way to do it because it means that there's

1090
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,300
never really going to be any kind of conflict about.

1091
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,200
There's never really going to be any issue with accidentally you know

1092
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,300
game getting thinking that it's in the game and it's not or thinking

1093
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:27,300
that there's Heroes when they're not but we don't really have any way

1094
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,800
of of knowing

1095
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,400
That we transitioned from a state of playing cutscenes to state of not

1096
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,300
played cutscenes.

1097
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,200
And so that's the next thing we should do.

1098
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,900
But at this point right?

1099
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,200
The five-minute warning so don't want to start it on that yet.

1100
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,000
Since I got to go a little early tonight.

1101
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,100
Anyway I feel like what I rather do is just go to the Q&A now so that

1102
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,400
we can get any questions that there might be and then we can start on

1103
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
some of that stuff tomorrow.

1104
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,100
So let me go ahead and move it to Q&A.

1105
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,700
There we go.

1106
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,800
Insofar as with adding a block until loaded style function, be a good

1107
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,000
idea to make sure even lower computers have all the layers loaded

1108
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
before the scene starts.

1109
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah.

1110
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,600
Potentially it depends what you want to optimize for, right.

1111
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,200
And we already have one.

1112
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,600
So if we want to do that, there actually is one of those.

1113
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,300
It's it is

1114
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,500
Where is it?

1115
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,700
Handmade render group.

1116
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,000
It's this.

1117
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,000
Right here.

1118
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,500
So, if you wanted to, for example, like what we could do, in fact, we

1119
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,900
could do this right now is, let's let me just just to show you how

1120
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,600
that's done, and we could do it.

1121
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,400
We could leave it this way.

1122
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,400
It's not a bad idea to just do.

1123
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,400
So if we do it like this, right?

1124
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,500
And we don't have a glitches because we're doing our prefetches

1125
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,300
prefetches.

1126
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:18,400
Yay!

1127
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:18,800
For us.

1128
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,400
Right.

1129
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,600
Well, if we were to turn off the prefetches to simulate like a

1130
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,000
superstar,

1131
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,900
Computer or something, right?

1132
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,600
So if we turned off the prefetch, which is here,

1133
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,300
we'd be back to glitch land, right?

1134
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,500
So now we see those glitches happening.

1135
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,200
You know, if we wanted to turn this glitches into pauses,

1136
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,800
What we could do instead is just not render.

1137
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:55,400
Any time, we sense that there aren't any of those that there aren't

1138
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,000
any assets that there are any assets missing, I guess what I'm trying

1139
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,400
to say.

1140
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,400
And the way that we would do that, right as we just say like oh okay.

1141
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,900
You know, in here when we do tiled render group to Output we could

1142
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,800
instead do like, okay, just take a look and say if all assets present

1143
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,700
right then do the render otherwise don't.

1144
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,100
And so now what it would do is it go like, okay, well, you know, now

1145
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,700
there's a little like hiccup each time but it's really brief, right?

1146
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,700
And so, that's totally, you know, a fine thing to leave in there and

1147
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,200
maybe that's

1148
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
We want, right?

1149
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And then you can also see like when I do, for example, if I do

1150
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,900
spacebar you can kind of see that with the exception of our ground

1151
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,900
tiles which page in as a separate thing.

1152
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,700
And that's kind of a different issue when we hit that spacebar.

1153
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:56,500
That thing also, we'll just wait until it's ready as well, so we can

1154
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,300
totally do that.

1155
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,800
That's a, that's an easy thing to do and probably it can't hurt.

1156
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,900
Right, probably.

1157
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,600
So we could just leave that in there and then once we put, you know,

1158
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,200
our our prefetch

1159
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,900
Back in then there's no hiccups and if you should have fall if you

1160
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,500
know, for some reason it did fall behind it.

1161
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,400
Be okay, you know, that'd be okay.

1162
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,900
So yeah.

1163
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,000
I'm going to go ahead and take out that times 10.

1164
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,200
Isn't there a way to clear the back buffer using Cindy?

1165
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,400
Yes, although it is not necessarily faster.

1166
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,300
You have to test it to see.

1167
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:00,700
Rep, rep instructions are often quite fast and so I don't know what

1168
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,900
we're using at the moment, but Cindy's not always the fastest way to

1169
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,100
clear, if I remember correctly but sometimes it is since, in that

1170
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,600
case, we really don't have to worry because clearing we only do it in

1171
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,300
the case where we don't render anything.

1172
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,300
We don't really have to care how slow the clear.

1173
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,000
Is that the moment I'm probably we never will have to.

1174
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,400
Would be my guess.

1175
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,900
Will there be any animated?

1176
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:24,200
Cutscenes are just zooming shots.

1177
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,100
Just doing shots, unless you count the, the like to frame for the

1178
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,200
Santa putting the hat on.

1179
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,700
Can you do a clock?

1180
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,600
Sure.

1181
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,300
15350 for

1182
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,600
Would it be possible to fade from the desktop to the game's initial

1183
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,600
black screen?

1184
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,900
Yeah, you can, if you want to I'm not a fan of Fade to Black.

1185
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,800
I don't really like Fades so much unless you are trying to do them for

1186
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,900
a very specific reason.

1187
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,300
You know, if you watch a movie there are very few Fades they're only

1188
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,900
employed in very specific like Fades and wipes are used very sparing

1189
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
in any modern cinematography, right?

1190
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,800
You know, you think you think wipe you start to think of like 1970,

1191
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,300
right?

1192
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,400
And so Fades, you know, are definitely still employed wipes, very,

1193
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,200
very wipes less.

1194
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,400
So, but Fades are still employed for certain emotional effects, but in

1195
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,200
this case, it's not necessarily one.

1196
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,700
It, it's not probably what I would expect.

1197
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
A fade in.

1198
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,200
Maybe I don't know if I would want to fade it or not.

1199
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,900
But but in terms of, can you do it?

1200
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:13,200
If you do want that effect, you could.

1201
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,900
And the way that you do that is, you would try to get the contents of

1202
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,600
the desktop background or you'd put up a layered window first and Let

1203
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,700
It Fade Out.

1204
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,400
And, you know,

1205
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,900
Yeah, I don't really know.

1206
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I mean, let me, let me try and sketch the idea out for you, I guess,

1207
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,700
because it's not super easy to explain but I can try to kind of give

1208
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,000
you what the idea is and and don't do it.

1209
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,800
Exactly the way I'm doing it here.

1210
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:03,100
But, you know, so if I were to do a fade out right here and make a

1211
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:06,300
thing here, that's just like internal void Fade Out.

1212
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,000
Then, what you would do, right?

1213
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,300
Is you take one of these windows.

1214
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,300
And you do exactly what we did to the main window.

1215
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,900
So you'd say, okay, you know, I'm going to make this window on to make

1216
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,200
it the size of the whole screen.

1217
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,000
And off we go.

1218
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,900
Now, I probably also need to.

1219
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:42,500
I need that window class to be something else, so I'm going to have to

1220
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,900
make one of these here as well.

1221
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,400
Although I might

1222
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,800
I might.

1223
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,600
I might be able to do it without one.

1224
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,500
Well, they'll do it anyway, right?

1225
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:06,300
All right.

1226
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,100
So if we have here, you know, here is our thing of this.

1227
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:16,200
And this.

1228
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,800
And that.

1229
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,800
So I'm going to say like, you know, we're going to fade this thing

1230
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,600
out.

1231
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,600
I'm going to pass my instance in.

1232
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,600
We don't really speak to need to, but we might as well.

1233
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,700
You can get it by calling, get module handle zero.

1234
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:38,600
Pro tip.

1235
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,600
So anyway, if we do this we create a window Joe fullscreen.

1236
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,300
What we would do is say oh you know what, give us something that's on

1237
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,700
you know over the whole screen might be the easiest way to do it.

1238
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,000
I'm just trying to think of the one that's the most likely to work

1239
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
most of the time because there's a lot of different ways.

1240
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,800
You could do this, you could try to capture the thing and drawn in

1241
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,600
your window.

1242
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,400
But this might be the one that's works the best because it doesn't

1243
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,700
require you to try and capture which could be unreliable, depending on

1244
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:07,600
the operating system, where

1245
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,600
This would probably work from XP forward, I don't know.

1246
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,400
So I'm going to sketching it out here.

1247
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
Your mileage may vary.

1248
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,000
It's not something I would really recommend shipping in a game for a

1249
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,600
particular reason.

1250
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,700
But you know, if you really want to do it you know, here's a way to

1251
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,800
try, guess is what I'm saying?

1252
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,600
So then, you know, we could just do a thing where we said, like, okay,

1253
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,800
we want to do an update layered window on this thing.

1254
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,200
So, here we go.

1255
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,800
Are we going out like so, and you can see this update layered window

1256
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:50,500
function is, you know, it's something that allows us to, you know,

1257
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:57,500
call the operating system and tell it to update this sort of window

1258
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,700
that's going to be translucent.

1259
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:02,100
In fact, it's the thing that we do for this and I covered it on stream

1260
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,200
before when we did the thing where we made our window translucent so

1261
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,400
you could see behind it.

1262
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,000
I don't know if you remember, we did that as a long long time ago like

1263
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,100
it

1264
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,300
Episode 30, or something.

1265
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:12,800
We did it.

1266
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,000
And so, if we want to do that here, right?

1267
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,600
We could do something where we do you know what else we might be able

1268
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,200
to do.

1269
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,400
Well, okay, and I'm gonna I'm gonna stop.

1270
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,400
Stop talking about, I don't know.

1271
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,800
Maybe we even still have update layered window in here.

1272
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,600
Do we know we know.

1273
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,100
So again, I would just need to call this.

1274
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,300
You can see what we've got here for docs.

1275
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,800
So we want to pass the window handle that we're trying to update,

1276
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,000
right?

1277
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,800
Which is this guy

1278
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:51,000
We want to pass a DC here for the screen and I think I don't actually

1279
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,300
know.

1280
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,400
So if HTC does handle to a DC for the screen, this handle is obtained

1281
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:55,700
by something.

1282
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,100
No man calling the function.

1283
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,800
Calling what function it is used for pal.

1284
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,300
Color matching when the window, contents are updated.

1285
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,000
If HCC is null, the default palette will be used, which is this is

1286
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,900
probably all fine.

1287
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,100
We probably don't need, either of those HTC's.

1288
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,200
I'm guessing I handle to a DC for the surface that defines layer

1289
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,600
window, create pedal DC.

1290
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:18,100
So we could, we could do both of those at zero potentially the new

1291
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,900
size of their window size, not change, we could do null.

1292
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:29,000
So, all of these we can probably do, you can probably do with no, I

1293
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,800
think.

1294
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,200
Ink.

1295
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,200
I think.

1296
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,000
Let's see, ya.

1297
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,600
So I think we can do these with no.

1298
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,300
So let's try that first and we'll see.

1299
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:42,900
So I'm just going to pass zero for this.

1300
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:48,300
HDC I'm going to pass zero for both of these, right?

1301
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,700
And this and that.

1302
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,800
And then I need to do the color key, the P blend and the DW Flags.

1303
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,300
So the color key

1304
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,600
I don't think we care about this.

1305
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,600
So, the code recent compositing.

1306
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,800
Larry, I don't think we care about that because we're not actually

1307
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,800
going to use it because our the blend function is got to tell it not

1308
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,900
to use that basically.

1309
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:13,400
So I'll just

1310
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,200
Put in some random thing here.

1311
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
So there's the color key.

1312
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,900
Now we need to blend function.

1313
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,700
Will it blend?

1314
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,100
And then we need to flags.

1315
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,500
And so the way we're going to do it is we're going to do U LW Alpha,

1316
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,700
which is telling it to do an alpha composite operation.

1317
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,400
And I'm sorry, I'm kind of flying through this.

1318
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,700
It's just cuz it's the certainly not really part of handmade here,

1319
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,200
obviously.

1320
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,200
But I'm going to do alpha level 0, Alpha levels less than 255 like

1321
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,700
Alpha level plus plus or something.

1322
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,500
So we go through all the ranges of it or whatever.

1323
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,000
And so then we just need to specify the how we want to blend our

1324
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,100
window on top of stuff.

1325
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,200
You know, I'm saying?

1326
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,500
So if we do that, we just have to say, okay?

1327
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,300
Lend Upland flag stress concept of alpha format, right?

1328
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,300
So let's start with the blend up.

1329
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,700
And then we got to specify the blind Flags.

1330
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,000
Then we got specify, the source constant Alpha.

1331
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,300
Then we got do the out format.

1332
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,800
Okay, so the blend up.

1333
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,500
Let's say the only source cessation of an operation that has been

1334
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,300
defined is AC Source over so hey not like a lot of options.

1335
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,100
There blend Flags, can't be set.

1336
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:37,200
So hey that's great specifies.

1337
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,300
An outrageous use for the entire source bitmap so this is just going

1338
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,100
to be our Alpha level, right?

1339
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,800
That work incrementally over time.

1340
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,399
Then we have an alpha format, which is showing the way it's our

1341
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,300
sisters are interpreted.

1342
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:53,500
Al format has a value AC Source Alpha by setting the alpha Channel.

1343
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,399
Okay, so we don't actually have enough a channel.

1344
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,000
I wonder if we can just set this to zero which means the red green

1345
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,500
blue channels.

1346
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,300
Must be multiplied for example, if your chance so is that the only one

1347
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:03,800
they do?

1348
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,100
When the alpha format member is AC Source Alpha, The Source, it must

1349
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,300
be 32 bits as if it is not the official fail.

1350
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:13,800
So I'm going to set that to zero.

1351
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,000
I hope so because we don't actually want it to have any Alpha.

1352
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,399
I don't know if we can or not though.

1353
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,500
So this makes fails spectacularly.

1354
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,200
Well, I got about five minutes left before I got to go so we'll see if

1355
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:25,899
we can get it working.

1356
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,500
Yep.

1357
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,600
Oh, that's going to Loop forever, isn't it?

1358
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:38,200
Area.

1359
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:45,200
Okay.

1360
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,700
yes, so Fade Out

1361
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,800
Let's see, so Fade Out.

1362
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,600
I'm going to do a sleep.

1363
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm going to do a one second sleep here.

1364
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:03,600
So we'll start out with 50 and go to 255, and it'll just sleep for one

1365
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
second in between Cycles.

1366
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,900
So we'll see if that does anything.

1367
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,000
So you can see I'm not getting anywhere with that.

1368
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:09,800
So, I'm not actually seeing my window.

1369
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,200
So I think I may have to pass more stuff to this.

1370
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,600
I may not be allowed to do what I did here unfortunately which is

1371
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:33,300
really too bad because I would have liked it to work but presumably it

1372
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:33,800
didn't.

1373
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,800
So let's take a quick look just here get last error.

1374
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,100
See what it didn't like.

1375
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,900
Okay, so error is 0.

1376
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,400
Hmm.

1377
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,100
That's kind of odd.

1378
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,100
We should have gotten an error.

1379
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,200
Presumably right.

1380
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,400
Because we're not seeing our window show up at all.

1381
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,700
Which is kind of odd because we know it's there.

1382
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,000
And we know it's on top.

1383
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,400
I wonder if we have our spy plus plus installed.

1384
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,200
We do, right?

1385
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:25,900
It's here.

1386
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:31,000
Here's our Fade Out window class and highlight.

1387
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,900
Guess let's take a look at it.

1388
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,400
Yeah, it's the whole screen so that's all correct.

1389
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,400
See, I don't know what's wrong with that.

1390
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,100
Like I said, it may be that you can't pass that many zeros to update,

1391
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,900
layered window, and expected, actually do anything.

1392
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
I was hoping to abuse it.

1393
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,500
So we wouldn't actually have to draw anything, but maybe we do have

1394
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:55,700
to.

1395
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,300
Let's take a look because the HDC

1396
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,300
Porter service by the new screams earlier, window of the conversation,

1397
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,300
not changing, it can be null, this can be.

1398
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,600
Now that can be, no, this can be known as well.

1399
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,600
So how does the color the CR key get used ever?

1400
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,200
I was wondering.

1401
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,400
Yeah because we're not using that so it shouldn't matter what we set

1402
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,500
that to so that should all be good.

1403
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:38,300
Yeah.

1404
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,300
So I don't know, we may have to take a look at this sometimes when I

1405
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,100
have a little more time because like I said you should be able to do

1406
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:47,200
this, it's how this thing works.

1407
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,000
But you may have to actually update the contents of the window is the

1408
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,600
problem.

1409
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:56,800
And yeah, and I don't actually know how to do that, part of it.

1410
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,900
Now it could be that we just need would need to clear it to Black.

1411
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,700
I guess I could get stock object that

1412
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,900
But I don't think that's that's not how these tend to work.

1413
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
The this is the thing that gives it the data.

1414
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:14,500
And so I'm I suspect that this that this is not a sufficient if that

1415
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,100
makes sense.

1416
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,600
So yeah, so what I could do, maybe

1417
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,900
yeah, let me just let me take one more.

1418
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:27,700
Look at this to see if there's anything I can quickly.

1419
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:33,700
Do that would give us one of those that would work.

1420
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,600
That's not useful.

1421
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,600
Table of coops, that's not good.

1422
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,100
Table of contents.

1423
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,800
That I can look at.

1424
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,300
Let's just go update, weird window.

1425
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,700
Yeah, I don't know if I want to look at any of these.

1426
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:06,500
They might not be what I want, but

1427
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,600
Yeah, so see, you can see here this is doing like our stuff to create

1428
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,300
like our DC.

1429
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,000
Look the same way that we were doing it and then they pass the full

1430
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,500
thing in.

1431
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,100
And I know that works.

1432
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,100
That's how the other thing works.

1433
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,500
So well.

1434
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:23,700
I mean I guess it's not, it wouldn't be too hard to Surly do that.

1435
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:29,300
I mean, we could if we wanted to use our resize dip section thing,

1436
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,200
right?

1437
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,800
Maybe we could make that work.

1438
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,200
So, something like this.

1439
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,800
And this would do that for us.

1440
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,000
I think, right?

1441
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:57,100
So we'd say like, oh, okay, create a dip section that we could use.

1442
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
We have to do a creek credible, compatible DC, as well, which I guess,

1443
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,700
I don't know.

1444
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,800
So, that'd be like a client rekt, get client wrecked.

1445
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,200
So here's our width and height.

1446
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,400
There we go.

1447
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,100
So then we'd have a dip section which we could draw two if we wanted

1448
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,500
to.

1449
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,000
And we could also do a thing where we then created all of our DC s.

1450
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,400
So the screen DC would just be, like, get DC 0 I assume.

1451
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,400
And our d.c.

1452
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,100
Our DC is just going to have to be compatible d.c., right?

1453
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,300
Yeah, this is going to take too long, there's no way I'm gonna be able

1454
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:25,600
to finish this in time because I'm already one minute over.

1455
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,300
All right, here's the deal.

1456
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,400
We will do this on Monday because it's not that hard to do.

1457
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,900
And we will just do it on Monday and I'll try to think over the

1458
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:41,400
weekend, what, the easiest way to would be to just get to do black

1459
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,400
because I feel like we shouldn't have to create an actual whole DC set

1460
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,400
up to just put the black window over there and make it fade in.

1461
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:53,200
So I'll think about if maybe there's a better way to do that and if

1462
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,700
there is, we'll go with it, all right?

1463
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,600
I'm going to shut it down.

1464
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,400
I said I got to go.

1465
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,200
So yeah.

1466
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,400
Thank you very much for joining me for another episode of how many

1467
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:06,500
here.

1468
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,700
It's a recording with you, as always, if you want to follow along the

1469
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,600
series at home, you can always well, you can always go to handmade

1470
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,000
here a.org and pre-order the game because come to the source code.

1471
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,300
So you can follow along at home.

1472
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:18,700
There's also Forum site.

1473
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,300
You can go to if you want to ask questions.

1474
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,300
There's a patreon page wants worth of video series and a tweet Baht

1475
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,800
which went down when they shut down our server.

1476
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,900
But I restarted it.

1477
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:30,400
And so in theory, it should be tweeting again starting next week.

1478
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,100
So sorry about that, but I'll check that yeah, one of these days.

1479
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,000
I'm going to go bother to find where the actual startup script is on

1480
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,500
that particular server, so that when it reboots, it will actually

1481
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,900
start my tweet.

1482
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,000
But again, what can you do?

1483
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,600
All right, so I'll be back here Monday and you can check that

1484
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,000
tweetbot, which I will make sure it's working in a weekend if you want

1485
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,700
to know the schedule.

1486
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,200
Probably five, again, I'll be back here, Monday until then, everyone

1487
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,400
have fun programming and I'll see you on the internet.

1488
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,200
Take it easy, everyone.
