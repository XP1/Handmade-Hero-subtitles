1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,100
The show where we code a complete game live on Twitch from scratch.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,300
Using no libraries, no engines, no artificial colors or preservatives

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
none of that stuff in here.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,500
This is 100% organic Computing at its finest.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,600
It commands a premium price at your local, organic market place where

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,800
there is a premium price on everything.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,800
And the grocery bill is very expensive.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,300
You know, the places I'm talking about and those are the kinds of

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,600
places you can find, fine, handmade hero code products.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,700
And speaking of which, if you are one of the people who have

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,100
pre-ordered the game on him, a hero to org, please remember that.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,600
You can follow along, exactly, with the code from today.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,900
It's day 49.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
So, if you would like to grab that zip file, you can download all the

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,900
source code in it, find a 48 zip and unzip that you will be exactly

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,900
where I am right now.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,400
And where am I right now?

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:00,800
It's

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Very good question that you have posed to me.

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,900
Obviously, you know, sort of telepathically because obviously I can't

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,700
hear you right now.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,200
But, but in my mind, right?

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,300
I'm receiving.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,500
That question from you, loud and clear.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,300
And basically, if you remember, we were at the point where we were

28
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,700
saying we have to, you know, I showed a very, very basic form of line

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,800
intersection to sort of get intersections.

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,900
Working in the game.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And then I said, we need to move up to the next level of complexity.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now in order to get better Collision detection.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,500
And so we were at the point where we did Implement some Collision

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,100
detection for him, but it was not particularly good.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,900
And and so we need to start thinking about how to make it better.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,800
And one way that we need to make it better is we need to start

37
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,600
handling things more robustly.

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Instead of making them infinitely.

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,300
Thin I talked about this a little bit yesterday.

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm trying to show a bug here that we should have.

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:00,900
I thought

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,600
Demoed it pretty.

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,500
Well, there it is.

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,500
Where you can kind of sneak through thin situations.

45
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,900
I'm also wondering what happens when it gets down there.

46
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,900
We get this weird situation where we, where we kind of where we get in

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
some kind of a weird hang situation.

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,600
I don't know what's going on here and I want to check it out to see

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,500
what the problem is.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,300
So

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,600
ha ha ha.

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,700
All right.

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Why?

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Why have we never seen this before?

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,900
That's very, that's very bizarre.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
Wait, how is that even happening?

57
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,600
You see what's going on here.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,300
We've got a mint.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
Ilex of one am in tile.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,500
Why of 31 past Mac style X of nine?

61
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,300
Which is fine and then one path Max Max tile y of 0.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,900
What's going on there?

63
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,800
What, what is going on there?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,500
How did the

65
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Of two values, equal equal 3, and the maximum of two values.

66
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Equal 0, methinks me thinks that we have a bug here, people because

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,000
that should not be the kit.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,300
But how is that possible?

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Right?

70
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
So someone's got a typo unfortunate that someone's me?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Because no one else even has the ability to edit code on this machine.

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,300
So, honestly, it's really hard for me to sit around and pretend that

73
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,100
someone else is at fault because pretty much it's always going to be

74
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,200
me.

75
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,900
So, let's see what?

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,800
The values are that we are putting in there before I continue talking

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
on the stream.

78
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,300
All right.

79
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,200
So, let's see what we've got.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,900
Here are AB style lie.

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Oh snap.

82
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Yeah, well, I'm glad that we happen to be testing right at the

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,200
wraparound point.

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Do you see what happened there?

85
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,800
This is kind of interesting.

86
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,100
Just goes to show you wrap around is hard.

87
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,600
Sometimes wraparound is hard.

88
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,400
So.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,200
What happened?

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,800
There is actually pretty interesting.

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,600
So.

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,500
We've got our ab style-wise and the player has just moved off the

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
bottom of the screen, which causes his y.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Coordinate to rap, to the top tile, right?

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,200
He's going on to the the top of the screen right at the very top of

96
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,800
the map.

97
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,600
So basically, he underflow 0 and goes to, you know, four billion,

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,100
which is exactly what we expect to happen.

99
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,800
And that's fine.

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,500
But when we do maximum of these two, right, it obviously picks this

101
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,100
one as the higher value, right?

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,200
And that's exactly what it should do because it is the higher value.

103
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,800
But then

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,900
Me add one.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,100
It actually becomes a lower value than this in the sense.

106
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,000
And the reason for that is actually because the mint ilex and mint.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,900
I'll why that we were at that we were using right?

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What we wanted to know was not actually what the maximum value was

109
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,800
between the things that we were going to.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,800
We actually wanted to know is just how far those whichever one was the

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,500
furthest from the mint ilex.

112
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,800
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,900
So I wonder what is the more stable way to do this computation such

114
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,100
that we do not have that wraparound problem.

115
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,600
That is very intriguing.

116
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,200
Right?

117
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,500
And I feel like probably what we would want to do is something like

118
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,900
say.

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,700
All right, let's actually test the thing that we want to test which is

120
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,900
which one is the farthest from meant ilex, right?

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,800
So we would find out here essentially, you know, which whichever one

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
is the farthest from it and the subtraction

123
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Do the right thing with regards to rapping.

124
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,100
I would think right?

125
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,900
Because we know that these two are relatively close to each other.

126
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,500
And so in theory, it's the subtraction would always work.

127
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
I don't know if that's actually track to think about that left to test

128
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,400
that out.

129
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,400
Right?

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Because let's say that this guy was, you know, some kind of was like

131
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,700
four billion or something and then mint ilex.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Was was going to be now that wouldn't work either because that would

133
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,600
still produce that would still produce that 4 billion value, and then

134
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,100
that would be totally wrong as well.

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,100
Mmm-hmm.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,700
How am I going to do that?

137
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,300
Stably?

138
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,800
Hmm.

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
That's a very good question.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,600
So really the problem too, is we don't even know which one should be

141
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
the minimum either because we don't really know which one is

142
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
technically, we just need know that we need to visit all of the tiles,

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,500
but we don't actually know what order to do the men.

144
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,000
That's tricky.

145
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,900
That is a tricky problem.

146
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,700
And one of the kind that I'm not particularly good at.

147
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,800
This is one of those like this is one of those bit fiddly sorts of

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,400
problems.

149
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,900
Mmm-hmm.

150
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
What do I want to do here?

151
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,600
It's kind of interesting.

152
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,700
Oh, no.

153
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,300
Where is the Whiteboard?

154
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
What have happened?

155
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,700
I must have closed it when we were doing all of our color fussing.

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,300
So here it is.

157
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,800
Let's go ahead and open that up.

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,800
Hello, krita.

159
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,700
There we go.

160
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,300
Oops, there we go.

161
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,600
Okay, we're good.

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Of course.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,900
I still need to pick up the background color.

164
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,400
There we go.

165
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,900
So this is a very interesting problem that we have here and I'm not

167
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,700
it's entirely certain how to solve it.

168
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,700
It's very, very, very interesting.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think what we have to do is sort of rebase our variables temporarily

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
to sort of, think about it in a different space.

171
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,200
So here we are at 0 0, right?

172
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,500
And the player has moved off the bottom here, so

173
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,000
Looking at a situation where the players starting position, was

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,400
something very low like zero or one, you know, something like that and

175
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,300
he moved to a position that's like four billion, right?

176
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,100
So what we want to do here is we want to start at the 4 billion and we

177
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,200
want to add to get to the 0, right?

178
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
And I guess we could say that.

179
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,300
What we want to do is always pick whatever the direction is, that

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,100
would be

181
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,700
The shortest to go, right?

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Because we know that these are supposed to be close together.

183
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,100
And so we always want to do the subtraction that would yield the lower

184
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,400
of the two distances, right?

185
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,600
So yeah, that's one way to think of it.

186
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Right?

187
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,600
So basically if I had, if I'm going for a billion to 0 or if I'm going

188
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
0 to 4 billion.

189
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,100
I know that going from 0 to 4 billion, will actually be relatively

190
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,500
short if I go in the negative direction, or if I go from, for if I'm

191
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
going in the Pub's Direction, going from 4 billion to 0 will be like

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,300
to be short because I just add one and I'll get there, right?

193
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,000
Or if I was going to one, I dad, you know, to and I'd get there.

194
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,300
So I need some.

195
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,800
A convenient way of producing that.

196
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,100
That iteration type right?

197
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,700
So I need some way of saying, what is the thing to start at?

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,700
Right?

199
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,300
And what is the thing to finish at?

200
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,000
And it needs to work on both boundaries.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,800
So it needs to also work when I'm at for a billion and I move to 0,

202
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,000
right?

203
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,100
So I would suspect, let's think about this.

204
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,900
So I would suspect that if I just took

205
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,200
Mmm, if I was to look at these and go, okay, if the difference between

206
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,100
like one way I could do it and this is I may be a little bit cheesy.

207
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,000
If the difference between the two values is greater than, you know,

208
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,400
that sort of halfway marker.

209
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,900
So basically in t32 Max over to, right?

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,800
If it's if that distance between them is greater than that, then I

211
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,000
know that I've wrapped around.

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,200
So I could detect the case in which that occurs.

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't know if that's the best way to do it because I'm trying to

214
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,700
think if there's some way to just do it with operations, that will

215
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,100
directly yield the correct thing because a lot of times with unsigned

216
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,000
into, if you think about it, you know, long enough you come up with a

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,400
clever thing.

218
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,600
We're just like, oh, okay.

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,600
This always works correctly, no matter which way I do it, right?

220
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
So one way, let's see.

221
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,000
So so let's say, let's see what the cases are here.

222
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,900
So let's say that I've got, I've got something like

223
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,600
Row 2 1, right, I've got something like 120.

224
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,200
I've got something like 0 to 4 billion, right?

225
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,000
And then I've got something like 4 billion 20, in terms of like

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
interesting cases.

227
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
So these are the normal cases, right?

228
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,600
And that's where the min max works just fine because it just picks,

229
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,800
whichever is the lower and whatever is the higher and goes between

230
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
them by adding one.

231
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
And then these are the are the are the ones that don't that wouldn't

232
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,200
work right now.

233
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
So, one thing that I

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,800
I'd do is say well.

235
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,300
Alright, what if I just always start at the location, the player was

236
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,600
so, I always start like 0, or 1 or 0, or 4 billion, or whatever.

237
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,200
And then, I just think of it as a problem of, I just need to know

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,800
which whether to add one or subtract one on each iteration of the

239
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,700
loop, right?

240
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,400
I just need to know which one of those to do and obviously, right in

241
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,100
this case.

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,300
I would want to add one.

243
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,900
In this case.

244
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,800
I'd want to subtract 1.

245
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,400
In this case.

246
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,300
I want to subtract one.

247
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,800
In this case.

248
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,500
I want to add one, right?

249
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,900
So these would be ad case.

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,400
Aces.

251
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
These would be subtraction cases, right?

252
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,800
So the question is given these examples.

253
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
What is the thing I could do?

254
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,400
That?

255
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,300
Would produce that value.

256
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,100
Right?

257
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,400
Like what would actually produce this particular thing?

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,300
So like these guys are examples of if I do the subtraction, right?

259
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,600
If I

260
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,700
If I did the new - the old right then I would get exactly the sign of

261
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,800
that result would give me which one I wanted to do certainly in these

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,000
cases, right?

263
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,600
Because if I did 1 minus 0, that equals 1, right?

264
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,700
And the sign of that is the direction I want to go.

265
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,200
If I did zero minus one which is, which is this case, I would get the,

266
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,600
I would get the negative one in signed, which is also the reaction

267
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,400
that I want to go.

268
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,800
However, in this case, if I were to do

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,100
20 minus 4 billion.

270
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm sorry, 4 billion, minus 0 I would get a plus 1, right?

271
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,800
And this case, if I did four billion, so it gets the opposite of the

272
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,700
sign there.

273
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,800
And so that doesn't really help me still determine what the sign is of

274
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
the values with that.

275
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm going to same thing with like greater than or less than right.

276
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Like I can't really use that which is sort of just the same as a

277
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,800
subtraction, right?

278
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,200
I can't ask whether the thing I'm going to is greater than the thing

279
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,900
that I was coming from because in this case, that would be a problem.

280
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,000
So what I can do again as I can I mean, this is the thing I keep

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,500
coming back to this is definitely the easiest is like just check to

282
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,700
see whether the distance between the two things is that and then flip

283
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
the iteration order.

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,100
But mmm-hmm.

285
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,400
Is there anything else I could do?

286
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, wait a minute.

287
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,100
Is that actually the case?

288
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Well, no, I think is it?

289
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,900
Because if I did the arithmetic, if I treated this?

290
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:43,900
Well, no.

291
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
No, that doesn't really help.

292
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,300
Mmm-hmm.

293
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,400
I don't know.

294
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,600
I don't know.

295
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,100
So I guess I'll just treat it.

296
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,900
I guess I'll just do the simpler case the simpler way to do it for

297
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,700
now, but this is something this bears.

298
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
Some thought.

299
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Because I feel like if we spent some time on this, this would actually

300
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
come out to be something relatively clean.

301
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:18,200
That would not involve a bunch of checking about the rap point, right?

302
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,500
I feel like we should be able to do this.

303
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh, wait a minute.

304
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,100
Haha.

305
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,500
Oh, wait a second, though.

306
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:40,100
You know what, this might work because 4 billion - 0 in signed would

307
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,500
actually come out to be negative 1.

308
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,200
Right, and 4 billion - I'm sorry 0 - 4 billion in signed.

309
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,100
Okay.

310
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,400
All right.

311
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
So we got to check this out.

312
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
Let's actually let's, let's, let's look at this.

313
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I know this is probably not the kind of thing that interests.

315
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,100
People on the stream, but you know what?

316
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,400
Sometimes I'm here every night.

317
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,600
Sometimes you just gotta go with.

318
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,200
You.

319
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,000
Just gotta he's got a bear with me.

320
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,900
So here's what we were doing.

321
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,200
Right.

322
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,800
And that's not that's not really any good.

323
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,000
So I'm just going to go ahead and say let's let's nuke that for the

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,600
moment.

325
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
And so we're going to say, all right, we've got a mint.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Ilex and the mint.

327
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Ilex is just or sorry.

328
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,200
I should say.

329
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
Well, we're going to still call it mint.

330
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:25,800
I like Steven.

331
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,500
That's not what's called, because we'll leave the loop the same but

332
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,900
then we'll change it after assuming this actually works.

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,100
At all, which I don't know if it will.

334
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,700
So what I want to do here is say okay, right.

335
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm going to start wherever the player was and I'm going to go to

336
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,700
wherever the player is going.

337
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,000
So actually, you know, I guess I will change the loop because I got to

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,100
change it anyway for those things.

339
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,300
So we'll say start tile X and then we'll say one past and tile X and

340
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,500
that's going to be whatever the new player position is like.

341
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,400
So there we go.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,200
There we go.

343
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,200
And then we just need, we need a Delta X and a Delta y, right?

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,800
And the Delta X and the Delta y are basically going to be the sign of

345
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,600
these values, right?

346
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,000
So what we need to do is say whatever the sign of if I was going from

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,800
the start tile X, you know, to the to the end tile X or vice versa

348
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,700
here like so.

349
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Start tile.

350
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Why like that?

351
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,400
And so, then the only kind of iffy thing about it is just if they are

352
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,800
both the same, right?

353
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,400
That's the only thing that's kind of annoying because I can't actually

354
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,900
it wouldn't actually get anywhere when I do the ad I suppose.

355
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,800
That's now that's that, that wouldn't actually quite work.

356
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,500
So, you know, what would be a little bit?

357
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,600
Better is if we did this Loop a little differently to.

358
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,400
So if I could just say

359
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,700
If I could just do it like this and say, okay, what we're going to do

360
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,900
is say we've got the this and then we're going to do this Loop and

361
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,000
this is going to be a while, right?

362
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
So, okay.

363
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,500
There we go.

364
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,500
While

365
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,500
Not equal to the last one, right?

366
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,300
So yeah, we'll do it like that and and we'll increment it there as

367
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,599
well.

368
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,300
Well, I guess that's actually got to be a plus equal since we're doing

369
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,700
a Delta Direction thing.

370
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,000
So that doesn't really give me a place to put it.

371
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
So I guess this is just going to actually be this.

372
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
There we go, and we'll have to check it manually.

373
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,500
So if AB style y equals,

374
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Mac style.

375
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,100
Why?

376
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:55,000
Or should say and tile why, then break else increment.

377
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,800
There we go.

378
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay, that's what I actually need to do there.

379
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
This is what we do is we just say, alright, we're going to start here

380
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,000
and then we're going to go until we hit that end Thailand.

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,300
We wanted to make sure that we actually process the end tile and if we

382
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,200
don't, we will go ahead and break out of it.

383
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,700
Right?

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,700
But this is going to have to be Delta Y and this is why they yeah,

385
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,800
what did I get?

386
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Okay, so then I can do the other one exactly the same way.

387
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,300
So I'll do that.

388
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll do this way.

389
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,600
And I'll do the exact same thing in here for this Loop.

390
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,000
So we'll just keep going till we hit that that end like so.

391
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,200
All right.

392
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,400
So now we've got it.

393
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
So we'll just do, okay.

394
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,100
We'll go through all of them and we'll stop when we hit the end

395
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,700
tilak's.

396
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,400
I like that's a little nicer regardless because then it's not, we

397
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,200
don't do one pass canned just to make it.

398
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,100
So, if it's a nice for a loop, so there we go.

399
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,100
And now I need to actually compute these things obviously.

400
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,500
So in order to compute them, I'm doing some traction here of anti Lex.

401
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:01,800
Yeah.

402
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,300
- start to like so and so I want to see what the subtraction actually

403
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,000
does for me.

404
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,400
So, let's take a look.

405
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,200
Mmm mint.

406
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll Y is actually supposed to be start tile.

407
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,400
Why start tilak's?

408
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,300
There we go.

409
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,100
Okay.

410
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,200
So let's set a breakpoint here so I can take a look at what's going on

411
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,500
here.

412
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,900
So when our dude comes in, we've got an old player, piano a new player

413
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,500
P.

414
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
And let's see what those actually are.

415
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I don't wait, but the dude isn't moving.

416
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Why are we getting this kind of craziness?

417
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
That's a bit odd, but you say,

418
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,200
oh, because it's the first time it's been re canonicalized.

419
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,600
That's a bit odd.

420
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,100
Don't you think?

421
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,400
You see what I'm seeing?

422
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,600
Why is it?

423
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,900
Why is the X and Y value, 5 and 5.

424
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,400
Like, how did that even ever get set to 5 in 5?

425
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,100
This is interesting.

426
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,900
Today is becoming a bit of a clean up day.

427
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,400
What is that?

428
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,200
That's a break point.

429
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Is that what that is there?

430
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,800
And even know that it showed me those there.

431
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,300
I guess it's because this is 2013.

432
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I don't have 2013, I have 2012 at at work.

433
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,700
All right, so I want to see what's going on there when we initialize

434
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,400
that player.

435
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,000
So,

436
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,200
Why is he coming in with such a because he's been set to that.

437
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,800
Why is he set to 5 and 5 as his offset?

438
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
That's not a court canonical.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,100
Coordinate at all.

440
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,100
That's just bizarre.

441
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,600
All right, so get rid of that.

442
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I must be some hold over from something old.

443
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,100
So let's try that again.

444
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,600
Now.

445
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,500
We're at least in a much better position here.

446
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Alright, so we have the start tile X and that's this is what I

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,600
expected to see.

448
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,000
Now.

449
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,700
We have the start Telex and the entitle, x x and tile, why?

450
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,000
And those are what we would expect.

451
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
So now we would expect compute.

452
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,300
No Delta's in this case, which is the case that I was prepared for in

453
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,800
why I wanted.

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
The breaks that breakouts this way.

455
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
So basically what happens is we immediately break on both of them and

456
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,500
we're done.

457
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,300
So we only do that one test, which is what we wanted.

458
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,000
So now if I do something a little bit more, like a little little more

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,100
relevant, so let's say I'm going down here and I do that.

460
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,000
Now I can set a breakpoint.

461
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,400
Well, he's actually moving and take a look at what he actually does.

462
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Okay.

463
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,800
So we go start Telex and start tile, Y, and N Telex.

464
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,900
X and tile.

465
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,300
Why?

466
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,400
And now we should get.

467
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,700
Oh, you know what though?

468
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,400
I did forget to do.

469
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,100
I've got to just take the sign which is all I actually want to hear.

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
All right, so let's try that again.

471
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,900
Where are we?

472
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Where was that?

473
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:51,900
Okay.

474
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,700
So, what I want to do here is just do sign, which I never remember.

475
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,400
I almost never call that on integers.

476
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,600
This is a, this is not a normal thing.

477
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,700
How do, what's the, what's the C plus plus, sign bit?

478
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,400
I don't want the C++ when I just want the regular one.

479
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,700
Let's see.

480
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Well, we'll take a look here.

481
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,600
I was hoping it's the regular one.

482
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,900
Okay, so it is just sine B.

483
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,000
I can call that regular.

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I didn't want to use some crazy C++ this, but that's all I actually

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
wanted and that's trivial operation to do, right.

486
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,100
It just has to look at the high bit to see whether the high bit set.

487
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,600
So I could actually do that myself if I wanted to, in fact, maybe I

488
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,700
just will I mean I could just shift it down, right?

489
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah, I could shift to download that might Sykes.

490
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
And so I'm just going to do it this way because that's a little

491
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,700
clearer to everyone else.

492
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,900
So let's say sign of or something like this.

493
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,400
And that will be in here and that should be totally in line and we'll

494
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,400
check out see if it is sign bit and that will be for an in 32 C value

495
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,400
and sine B value.

496
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,100
Okay.

497
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,100
So oops I said, sign bit sign up.

498
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,100
There we go ambiguous.

499
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,900
Call to overloaded function.

500
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
My there are quite a few of them there.

501
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, I can only get, I can't actually get the sign of just a regular

502
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,700
value.

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,500
I want to just a sign of the regular value.

504
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,300
I guess I'm going to have to do that myself.

505
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,600
It looks like unless I'm wrong about that.

506
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,300
I just want sign integer.

507
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,100
I thought there was a standard one for it.

508
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,600
And I just it's escaping me at the moment, but I was quite sure that

509
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,000
they're originally was least.

510
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,400
I thought there was but I guess not.

511
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,400
I guess not someone on the stream will tell me later.

512
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,300
That's usually the way that it works when I forget one of these

513
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,800
things.

514
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,900
All right.

515
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Well, I guess I don't get to get to know that but I feel like the

516
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,900
compiler.

517
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,100
Very least should be able to do it pretty easily.

518
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,700
Yeah.

519
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,200
All right.

520
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,800
Well, let's take a look at what it does here.

521
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:18,700
So if I were to say, if value if value is, is greater than zero, then

522
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,900
it's one else.

523
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,300
It's negative 1.

524
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,200
Right, that sort of thing.

525
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Of course.

526
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,100
I also would like to know.

527
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,400
I don't really care what happens at the zero case.

528
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,700
Hmm.

529
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,500
Maybe I would say that if it was at zero will also call it 1.

530
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,800
So I have to have a tiebreaker in there, right?

531
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,900
Because it could be exactly zero which case there is no sign.

532
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:43,900
So, I don't know.

533
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,500
So I want to see what the compiler produces for that.

534
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm a little bit interested to see, actually.

535
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,200
All right.

536
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
So let's take a look here though.

537
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,800
And just make sure that that's working at all as a first at the first

538
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,300
step.

539
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,300
Okay, so that's just still produces zero.

540
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,000
Or what right now?

541
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,100
Sorry, it should produce one, which is perfect.

542
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,200
No problem there and let's keep going.

543
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,600
So, if I go ahead and do this guy now, I should be able to see ya.

544
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
So, start Telex start to, I start Telex.

545
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,900
Start to why?

546
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,500
I will say.

547
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,900
It's a little odd.

548
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,500
Want to see something else here.

549
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,200
Why?

550
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,700
It's still a little confusing.

551
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,100
Like this doesn't make sense to me.

552
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
I feel like we have another bug here as well.

553
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,800
It's definitely added buggy kind of day.

554
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
I think today is just going to be a debugging day.

555
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
We don't normally do that in the Stream because I kind of go through

556
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,500
things quickly and we don't have time to really stop and think about

557
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,900
things.

558
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,800
But so why if I was moving my guy down right because like, you know,

559
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,600
If I run this, the guys going downward, I guess, if I set the break

560
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,100
point, right?

561
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,100
When he jumped back up to the top maybe, but I'm going to make sure

562
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,900
that that doesn't happen now, so, I'm going to set that break point.

563
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,200
Well, I can see exactly where he is, exactly where he was moving.

564
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,600
Right.

565
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,500
But even that jump of the top, that should just be a memory of store.

566
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,800
So that wouldn't even show up that way.

567
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,500
So, I want to see what these values are, right?

568
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Start tile X.

569
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,700
So, how is the end tile X4?

570
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,700
Like how is that happening?

571
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Why is this x value for?

572
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,500
Who is doing that, right?

573
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,200
Because the guy is not moving anywhere in X, so, it doesn't make a

574
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
whole lot of sense to me that, that, that would happen.

575
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,200
I want to see what's happening at the top of this function.

576
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,500
Yeah.

577
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,300
Okay.

578
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,500
So let's see.

579
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,300
DDP.

580
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,400
What's DDP?

581
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,800
It's zero negative one.

582
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
That's exactly what I would have expected it to be.

583
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,700
So we come through here.

584
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,600
We do our length squared - there we go.

585
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,700
I've got that 1.0.

586
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,900
We multiply by the player speed, we add in.

587
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,900
Well, that's actually totally fine.

588
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,100
Right?

589
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
Because that's a very, very small X number.

590
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,500
Right?

591
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,400
That's that's like, you know, .004 or whatever.

592
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
So that's totally fine.

593
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Maybe I was just misreading it before.

594
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,700
So new player pee.

595
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
New player old player P.

596
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,700
So they both day old player.

597
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,300
P already has an ex of 4.1.

598
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,100
Actually in it.

599
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,900
Which doesn't so how big was that?

600
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,100
How big?

601
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Oops, how big was a tile map on a tile on a side?

602
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,400
Maybe I'm just like forgetting my old.

603
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,500
Look at I'll side and M is only one point three nine.

604
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,700
So you should never be able to have

605
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,900
And offset of for that's like totally not allowed at all.

606
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,200
Right, so we've got, we've got some bug's to deal with here.

607
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,800
So let's actually, I'm just going to step straight up step through the

608
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,100
code directly and figure out what's going on here.

609
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Because we've got, we have some bugs lurking, at least one probably

610
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
more lurking in our code.

611
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,800
And I think the most important thing to do by far before we go, any

612
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,300
further would be to get rid of them.

613
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,100
So I'm going to go ahead and take a look at the startup code here.

614
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,700
I guess I'll take a look at what happens when we actually initialize a

615
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,400
player and see see what happens in there.

616
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,200
Okay.

617
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,900
So let's go ahead and run the game and when I initialize my guy, I

618
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,400
want to see what his situation is Right entity.

619
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,900
So and interestingly enough, when we do get entity with that energy

620
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,200
index.

621
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,900
I am assuming that we were clearing but we could double-check that as

622
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,200
well.

623
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,600
So when we start that all looks

624
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,900
Totally reasonable.

625
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,800
The offset is 0 which is exactly what I would expect.

626
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
And so, let's see what happens.

627
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,000
Here we go, through is controller stuff and that nothing else will

628
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
happen here, which is exactly what we would expect.

629
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
Because no other controllers have said anything.

630
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,600
The camera is following this entity.

631
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,600
So it's going to go ahead and take his Z value.

632
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,500
It's also going to do a subtraction here to see whether it needs to

633
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
adjust to follow him.

634
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,700
It does not, so that's all.

635
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,200
Fine.

636
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
And let's see.

637
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,900
We don't actually have is entity even defined in this scope.

638
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,800
I don't even know what that's actually showing me.

639
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,200
Anyway, so we're going to go ahead and draw the bitmap.

640
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
We do this stuff.

641
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
We draw everything, which is good.

642
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,300
Go ahead and draw the tile map.

643
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,600
Nothing particular interesting there.

644
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,200
This is the end of it was looking at.

645
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,600
So we go ahead and we're going to do so entity index 0, we actually

646
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,800
shouldn't ever draw.

647
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,000
That's the no entity.

648
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,700
So we wouldn't we don't even have to actually Loop over that in a day.

649
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,900
I couldn't make that just Loop.

650
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,000
Start at one, The Entity exists will prevent it from happening but

651
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,800
something to note.

652
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,800
So, all right, when we're in here, here's our guy again.

653
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,900
He still has an X.

654
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,200
That's what we expected.

655
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,100
So that X is totally correct.

656
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,000
And no problems there.

657
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,500
So that's all good.

658
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,800
So I suspect that basically.

659
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,900
Oh, you know what?

660
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,600
You know what?

661
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,300
I just realized this may be the bug that we.

662
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah.

663
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,300
Yep.

664
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,200
So this could actually be this right here.

665
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,800
I forgot to fix this typo.

666
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,700
We talked about on the forums briefly as one that we had to do.

667
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,100
So we're supposed to reconnect lies before this.

668
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:08,200
And also this re doubles my previous to do about wanting to take care

669
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,400
of the re canonical Hice problem, which maybe we'll

670
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
You as well tonight.

671
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,100
So yeah, okay.

672
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,200
So now that we've got that straightened away because one of the

673
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
problems right with that recognize thing as I sort of said we'll deal

674
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,800
with that in a bit because I didn't really want to go fussing with it

675
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,200
too much because we're really not sure what we're going to do with a

676
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,900
bunch of those things.

677
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,300
Yet.

678
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,700
It means you have to type that re canonicalize, which is just kind of

679
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,100
error prone, right?

680
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And it's not good.

681
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,100
So let me go ahead and get us back now because I think what happened

682
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
is basically when I moved the guy over here.

683
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Here it was never Rica nanak lies in his position.

684
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,900
So he was constantly offset way over from where he was, right?

685
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,600
So now when I do this again, I think we should see like a better.

686
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,500
We should see a much better set of tile pieces of Tau information here

687
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,700
5353.

688
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,400
Perfect.

689
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,900
That's what we expect to see most of the time.

690
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,200
It should be in the same tile and there we go.

691
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,000
With our Delta is Delta 1, Delta 1, okay.

692
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,300
So, there we go.

693
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,400
So now he's doing his thing.

694
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Let's go ahead and see if I can if I can break us again.

695
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,100
So I gotta get through here.

696
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,600
Like so, come on, you can do it.

697
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,700
There's bugs in the Collision detector.

698
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,100
Come on.

699
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I know you can do it.

700
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,400
We know there's a bug.

701
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,800
The Collision detector is a little too good right now.

702
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,700
We want it to be a little bit worse than it is so that we can glitch

703
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,000
through it.

704
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Easier.

705
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,500
Come on.

706
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,600
I can't demo the glitching.

707
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,200
If you don't let me

708
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Through there.

709
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,200
Come on.

710
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,000
All right, you know what?

711
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,900
We're just going to make a door.

712
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,300
We're just going to flat out.

713
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,200
Make a door there.

714
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,200
That's what we're going to do.

715
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,100
It could also be that now that we fixed that problem.

716
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
We're iterating over.

717
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
Walls better write, it could have been that that problem was also

718
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,700
causing us to not iterate.

719
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,900
Over the door is properly over the over all the tiles that we should

720
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,700
have been, and we were missing them.

721
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,600
So that's why I was able to glitch through it.

722
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,300
So easily.

723
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,100
I'm pretty sure we could still go through it.

724
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,100
If we tried though, because like I said, the Collision detector

725
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:19,300
currently I think still is kind of buggy.

726
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,800
But yeah, it may have been that that bug was was what was allowing me

727
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,900
to do it so easily because it wouldn't check the right tiles.

728
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,400
And so we were able to get through it.

729
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
Well, I want to test my

730
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,100
tapping solution.

731
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,800
So what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to force their to be.

732
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,300
I'm going to force their, to be a door there and I can do that in the

733
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:39,500
thing.

734
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,800
That creates the tile code.

735
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,000
I can just straight up, say, you know what, guys, there's always a

736
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,300
door in the downward Direction because hey, I want there to be.

737
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,400
So frankly.

738
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,300
It's just like, okay.

739
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,500
Oh, you know, what I could do to?

740
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,000
I could just say, you know what, there's always, there's always a

741
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,400
door.

742
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,000
It's like surprise.

743
00:33:59,700 --> 00:33:59,800
No,

744
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
No one gets too close.

745
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,600
Anything.

746
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,100
Oops.

747
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,800
Yeah, that's the opposite of what I want to do.

748
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,100
My bad.

749
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,900
Right?

750
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,500
What I want to do is come down here and reset it to what?

751
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,100
Yeah.

752
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,100
Sorry about that.

753
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,000
Okay.

754
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,199
So now if I come down here, I should be able to trigger the case and

755
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,100
we can actually test it.

756
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:23,300
Now.

757
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,800
It looks like it was not quite working there.

758
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,400
So what I need to do is just go.

759
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,100
All right.

760
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,800
What can I do here?

761
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,900
I need to set a breakpoint that's basically conditional on that.

762
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
So I'm just going to go ahead and write that in.

763
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,800
So I can take a look at my Delta case where I will do the wrap around.

764
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,400
So basically what I'm going to do here is say, you know, something

765
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,300
like if and tile

766
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,800
Yeah, if n tile, Y is greater than n.

767
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
Ty Lex, I'm sorry.

768
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,300
Aunt, I'll Y is greater than start tile.

769
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,900
Why then I'm going to just want a break right there.

770
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,600
Right?

771
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
We'll just stop right there.

772
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,400
So I'm going to set a breakpoint on that and it's just something I

773
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,300
like to do a lot of time.

774
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,400
So I'll just write some code in that breaks on the case that I

775
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,100
actually care about just like right there and then I can just go ahead

776
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
and look at what happens.

777
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,000
So the start towel start to write n tile and tile exactly what we

778
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
thought was going to happen.

779
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,700
Right?

780
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
We're going from 0 to 4 billion.

781
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,500
So we produce the Delta X of 1 and the Delta y of negative 1 which hey

782
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,700
is exactly what I wanted to have happen surprisingly enough.

783
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,600
So it did.

784
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,000
So it turns out the wraparound arithmetic is totally what you want.

785
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,800
So

786
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,600
What was the problem there is really the question.

787
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,800
What was the problem?

788
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,600
So we do these tests and that's fine.

789
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,800
And then what do we actually record is the entity as the new player

790
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
position do?

791
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,300
That's correct.

792
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,200
That's all pretty much what you would expect.

793
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
So, yeah, that seemed like, it worked.

794
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,000
Exactly, right?

795
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,500
So, what was the problem?

796
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,100
Why did we have a problem with not seeing where the guy was

797
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,500
afterwards?

798
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:23,700
Right?

799
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,100
Because if I'm not mistaken, where is our dude, right?

800
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,500
Whereas, our dude is?

801
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,100
Gone, which seems undesirable to say the least.

802
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,800
So what I'd like to do is go ahead and say at this point.

803
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,700
I'm going to go ahead and break in the render and say, where did my

804
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,200
dude go, right?

805
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,400
I don't know where he is.

806
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,600
He should be here somewhere.

807
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,700
So let's find out.

808
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,000
First of all, let's find out where the camera is because that's

809
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,200
interesting, right?

810
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,900
And then, we can figure out what the diff is.

811
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,800
So what's the diff?

812
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,500
What is the difficulty, the diff between the camera and the guy?

813
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,800
Is negative 9 and a gigantic y value.

814
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,700
So, the camera does not appear to have properly caught up with the

815
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,400
dude, which, which seems a little odd.

816
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,800
Oh, right.

817
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,100
Yeah, so this is also going to have to get upgraded.

818
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,400
Now to handle the wrapping, right are moving the camera to handle the

819
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,300
wrapping by wrappings complicated.

820
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,300
You got to you got to have your stuff together.

821
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,200
I wonder if if allowing rapping was a bad idea, I guess for

822
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,000
educational purposes.

823
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,100
Maybe doesn't because you get to see me after go through all this

824
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,800
stuff, but it's crazy.

825
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,900
How much stuff you have to think about extra.

826
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,800
You can't just cheese out, right?

827
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,300
So I forgot that we basically haven't done much with the camera.

828
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,500
What I'd really like to do with the camera here is do something more

829
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,900
along the lines of search for the closest camera point that we want to

830
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,600
view, which would be something that would be generated along with the

831
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,200
world.

832
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,500
But in the interest, of doing something more

833
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,700
Straightforward, I guess, what?

834
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,600
We'd rather do here is say, if the camera supposed to be basically

835
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,900
every 17.

836
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Maybe we just do a divide of that absolute tile for the guy.

837
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,500
And we just set the camera to be wherever that actually is right for

838
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,000
now.

839
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,400
Because that would always that would always work and that may just be,

840
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,000
you know, a better way to leave it in there.

841
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Something that basically just says, what's the closest centered screen

842
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
for the dude and set it to that?

843
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,300
All right.

844
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,000
So, of course 17 doesn't evenly go into 4 billion.

845
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So at the wraparound Point, that's pretty interesting at the

846
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,100
wraparound point.

847
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,600
You wouldn't really even be able to quite do that, right?

848
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,900
Because if you think about it,

849
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,600
This is turning into a much more interesting stream for me.

850
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Probably not for everyone else.

851
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,700
But so if you think about it, we've got this situation where we're

852
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,400
saying, we're viewing the the, you know screen.

853
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,300
Which is a certain, you know Dimension that we wanted for playability,

854
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,600
which is 17 by 9 or something like this, right?

855
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,800
And remember what we're actually said, it was 17 by 9.

856
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,100
So for a 17 by nine screen, like those numbers, don't go into four

857
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,200
billion and some odd, right?

858
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,900
The, the actual 2 to the 32nd, right 2 to the 32nd.

859
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,500
That number of tiles isn't evenly divisible by 17 or 9.

860
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,800
So, when we do our rap,

861
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,300
Rapping right?

862
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,200
We would not be able to put a screen right there.

863
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,000
Right?

864
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:40,100
So at the wraparound Point, you'd get this other, you'd get a screen

865
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:44,900
that was like misaligned or you get, you know, yeah, you'd get

866
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,600
something that was sort of going to be half off like, like that.

867
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,000
And you'd see part of the of the top part of the world, which kind of

868
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,900
breaks what we would want to do, right?

869
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,800
And so,

870
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,400
So really if you want to have that properly, you do have to always do

871
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,200
it so that you kind of know, right?

872
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
What the actual.

873
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,500
You kind of know what the actual.

874
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,100
Places are in your game and what constitutes a screen and you always

875
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,400
have to actually use some additional information.

876
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,600
If you want to do it this way.

877
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,700
I wonder if this just means that rapping is a big No-No and we don't

878
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,600
want to do that.

879
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,200
Right?

880
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,600
It could mean that we just would encounter all kinds of problems like

881
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
this, where we thought something would work.

882
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,100
Okay, but then it turns out that when it's on the edge, you know, it

883
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,500
won't, you know what I mean?

884
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,700
So, I wonder if we want to say, we always start like right in the

885
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,000
middle and we never let the

886
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,400
World's wrap around to the other side.

887
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,400
So instead of being toroidal topology, right?

888
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,700
We say no, we're going to have discs topology, right?

889
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,100
I don't know.

890
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,800
It's a good question, but it seems like it seems like if nothing else

891
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,300
the fact that you can't do it, the screens evenly means that you could

892
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,600
never actually, if you wanted all 17 by nine screens, you would never

893
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,000
actually be able to make it go.

894
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Go the full way.

895
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,200
So like at the very least, you'd think what we would want to do is

896
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,700
say, okay.

897
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,600
It's not for billion around.

898
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,600
Anyway, we'd want to do, like, whatever the closest multiple of 17,

899
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,200
was 24 billion, right without going over.

900
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,200
So, it just seems to me.

901
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,600
I'm just just thinking through that.

902
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,200
It just feels wrong, like, it feels like.

903
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,900
All right, if we can't have that workout in a clean way, then maybe we

904
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
just disallow it.

905
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,000
It's like forget it.

906
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,700
You're not allowed to do that.

907
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,400
We have some way that we set.

908
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,600
The initial place where I swear screen start is, you know, is in the

909
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,700
middle somewhere and rapping is just not allowed.

910
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,700
Mmm-hmm.

911
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,900
I think I might just go ahead and say,

912
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,900
For now because it really just feels like it's going to introduce bugs

913
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,200
and we don't get much out of it.

914
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,900
We only just did that because it was like, oh, hey, you know, we don't

915
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,700
have to, you know, why not right was kind of the reason to do it at

916
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,100
the time and it seems like it's just more trouble than it's worth at

917
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,800
that point.

918
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Right?

919
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,500
Because you get a bunch of stuff that would have been much easier to

920
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,300
write that it's now not so.

921
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:27,900
Okay.

922
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,400
I think I'm going to say that.

923
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,900
I think I'm

924
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,100
It's going to ixnay it right now and say we're not going to allow the

925
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,300
wrapping to happen.

926
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,900
We're only going to say that we have to do.

927
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,400
You have to start in the middle and go from there.

928
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,700
So I believe screen X and Screen y-yeah our initial values.

929
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,900
So we would set screen X and Screen.

930
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:56,000
Y to be like in 32 Max over 2 and 32 Max over to like so, right.

931
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,800
And so that way we would start off.

932
00:42:59,400 --> 00:42:59,700
Oh,

933
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,300
And we have to adjust our tile map our tile chunk indexing as well.

934
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,800
So that's actually a good reason probably why we didn't do that

935
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,300
initially.

936
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,800
So if you remember we have not implemented our storage yet either,

937
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,400
right?

938
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,400
So our storage for Todd chunks was still going off of the fact that we

939
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,200
just allocate a hard-coded array of those two chunks at the beginning

940
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,500
and go from there.

941
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,800
So, yeah, I don't know.

942
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,800
Maybe we'll have to will will do this as a to do for when we actually

943
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,300
Really Implement full sparseness that can take any values in which

944
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,100
again, not something to do.

945
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,600
Now waiting for a full sparseness.

946
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,200
And then I'll say, okay, we'll just set this to something.

947
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
That's at least not going to rap.

948
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,200
For the moment and we'll leave it at that.

949
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,900
Okay.

950
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,900
So back to where we were now that we've at least looked at all these

951
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:03,100
bugs that we have here and I might I might want to go ahead and second

952
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,500
what's going on here.

953
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,400
There we go.

954
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,500
That back in.

955
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,600
Okay.

956
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,500
Wait a minute.

957
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,400
I forgot there's another problem.

958
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,000
If I start you off on 1616, then players have to be initialized to be

959
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,200
where who wear that actually is.

960
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,800
You know what, I should probably 22 when we actually drop a player

961
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
down when I initialize player.

962
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,600
I should probably put them somewhere where the camera can see them.

963
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,400
Right?

964
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,900
That would make sense.

965
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:33,100
Right?

966
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,500
Because we have a camera P.

967
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,400
Right?

968
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,200
And so what I should probably do is make the camera P start out to be

969
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,000
looking at the first place in the world and then

970
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,800
Make sure I put the players down near where that camera p is or I

971
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,100
guess I could do it vice versa.

972
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,700
But either way I would probably want to say.

973
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
Okay, we're going to start.

974
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,100
If we're going to start the world off there.

975
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,900
We want to have a place for the players start off as well.

976
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:59,800
So we'll do see 16 by 16.

977
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,800
And you know what, I guess even this is kind of not really all that

978
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,200
necessary quite yet.

979
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,800
Because if I was just to leave it at this as long as I put those walls

980
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,200
back in, we're actually fine, right?

981
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,200
The only actual problem was because we were glitching through that

982
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,400
wall because we never generate anything that can go in that direction

983
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:22,800
either.

984
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,700
All right.

985
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,300
So let's get back to the Collision detection thing because we've got

986
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
so many things that we want to do to do here.

987
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,200
It's like going to be nice.

988
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:31,900
We kind of want to.

989
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,500
Start chopping through the so I just don't want to go chasing down a

990
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,000
bunch of these things that are bugs, that are only because we're sort

991
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,600
of at the point where it just kind of defining engine stuff.

992
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
It's much easier to fit through this door.

993
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
Now that we're only a point.

994
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,400
It's kind of a shame to ruin that in a second, but that's what we're

995
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:46,900
going to do.

996
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:47,700
Alright.

997
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,400
So basically what I wanted to do today was just start talking about

998
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,800
how to make our Collision detection.

999
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,400
Wider.

1000
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,100
It does look by the way, that like that, glitching through the wall is

1001
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,200
almost impossible to do now, even though I still think it should be

1002
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,800
possible.

1003
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:01,800
I guess you

1004
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,700
Just much harder.

1005
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,200
Yeah.

1006
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah.

1007
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,200
I don't know why that's going on.

1008
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,500
I don't know why that's not going.

1009
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,300
I should say suddenly we got robust Collision detection.

1010
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,400
It's not pretty sure it's not actually robust.

1011
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,100
But what can I say?

1012
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,500
So fixing that typo in terms of re canonicalizing, was actually most

1013
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,600
of the problem.

1014
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,300
It would, it would appear for being able to phase through the wall at

1015
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:22,400
all.

1016
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,800
And without that, it doesn't look like you can really do it anymore.

1017
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,700
So, oh, well, not as much motivation, but even so we still have a good

1018
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:31,800
reason.

1019
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,700
And why we want to talk about what I was going to talk about today.

1020
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
We really have still have two.

1021
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,900
Good reasons, right?

1022
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,400
How much time I got left.

1023
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,700
It's going on here.

1024
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,100
No, I got no time left.

1025
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Well, okay, I can still do some of it.

1026
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,600
So let's do a little bit of it.

1027
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,500
Too many, too many weird bugs and stuff to talk to to look through

1028
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,600
today was not a good day for streaming new stuff.

1029
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,100
But you know, sometimes you got to go through cleanup sorts of things.

1030
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,600
All right, so

1031
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,200
What I wanted to talk about today was just how to start making the

1032
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,400
connection better by looking at the guy as more of a area rather than

1033
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,100
a point.

1034
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,600
And of course we still, you know, you can see the effects of that

1035
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,400
already which is because you can enter penetrate this wall like that,

1036
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:12,900
right?

1037
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,000
And we want to kind of fix that.

1038
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,100
And then we're going to do the stuff where we actually allow them to

1039
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,900
Glide as well, which is sort of one of the other reasons that we want

1040
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,100
to do Collision detection stuff.

1041
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,000
So what can we do, right?

1042
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,200
What I want to talk about was what can we do to get it so that he's

1043
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:27,800
not

1044
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,800
Sticking in that wall and I guess if we only have 12 minutes left, you

1045
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,500
know one thing I could do is just say that for tomorrow.

1046
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,000
I'm trying to think if there's others bugs since today was almost an

1047
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,400
entirely debugging day.

1048
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I'm trying to think if there's other buggy sorts of things that we

1049
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,300
would want to do.

1050
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,100
So I could just introduce it and coat it tomorrow since it's very

1051
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,900
straightforward what we actually want to do as well.

1052
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,100
And I don't know what are some of the other bugs that we had.

1053
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,400
I could look for some of our to dues and just see if any of them were

1054
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,200
Were there.

1055
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,500
So maybe I'll do that.

1056
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,500
Since this was the thing that caused us, the real problem.

1057
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,200
Maybe I'll fix that canonicalization thing.

1058
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,400
So maybe what I'll do is say, okay.

1059
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,800
What I want to do in, we were you know, that was a pretty bad bug that

1060
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,400
we had and I want to make it so that we're unlikely to have that bug.

1061
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,500
So what I'd like to do is go ahead and say this offset parameter,

1062
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,600
maybe we just don't want that to be something that gets modified very

1063
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,100
often without being able to re canonicalize after.

1064
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,900
Now, it's not necessarily the case that

1065
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,600
we want to prevent it from always doing that but we just in general,

1066
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,300
we'd like to go ahead and say that we're going to re canonicalize

1067
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,700
that.

1068
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and introduce a

1069
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
function that does the the change and the re canonicalize together.

1070
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,000
So I'm basically going to say okay, you know offset I'm going to say

1071
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:52,800
we've got Tom a position here like like so I'm going to say that we

1072
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,400
have offset, tilemap position.

1073
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:02,700
Or maybe I'll just do offset and we'll pass in the thesaurus value,

1074
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,300
right?

1075
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
So this is the pose.

1076
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,300
And P dot offset will plus equal to whatever the offset is that you

1077
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,300
want to pass in and you pass in that offset, right?

1078
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,900
And that's that's really all I'm talking about here.

1079
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,100
Something that's going to do that and then we'll Rican, Annika lies.

1080
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
So, where did I actually get?

1081
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,200
That re canonicalize from RE canonicalize position, this guy.

1082
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,100
So we'll do that and I guess it needs the tile map as well, because of

1083
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,600
course, it needs to know how big the tile side is in meters.

1084
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,700
So this is what we will actually be doing.

1085
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,500
There we go.

1086
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
When we want to offset one of these Taliban position peas, and that'll

1087
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,100
just return the new one.

1088
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,700
So, we've got the new one here.

1089
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,800
Well, I guess I can just return the old one return.

1090
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Like so, so that would basically just be a little inline function that

1091
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,700
just does the two operations that we were doing manually before and

1092
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,400
that would allow us to to not make that mistake because then we'll

1093
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,900
just use that when we offset things.

1094
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,000
And so what I can do is just sort of make a note to myself here.

1095
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,800
Sometimes I'll do this and say, okay, let's take a look at the people

1096
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,100
who actually should be doing stuff with this.

1097
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,100
Let's go ahead and make that happen there.

1098
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,200
And this is kind of this.

1099
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,200
Is so I've talked before about how I don't like private.

1100
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,700
So this is tends to be what I do instead of private.

1101
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,300
If I have I probably it tends to be like a note to myself that this is

1102
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,000
not something that I should be updating very often, right.

1103
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,600
This is like the most that I'll usually do is I'll do something to

1104
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,900
make it so that it's like, oh it's got a marker on it, right?

1105
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,900
So that now I know.

1106
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,200
But every anyone who wants to do Shenanigans with it still, can I just

1107
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,300
want them to know that?

1108
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,100
Okay, just make sure that you're aware of it.

1109
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,400
It.

1110
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,800
And I'll put a note in there in a second that says, what's going to

1111
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,400
happen there?

1112
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,800
This needs to take it.

1113
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,700
Map, obviously.

1114
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,900
So that should be everything Tom at position.

1115
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,900
And then we just do this right now map and then we don't have to do

1116
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,100
Rican a lake lies anymore.

1117
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
So basically all these guys are fine.

1118
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,700
But of course they would look like this.

1119
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,400
But we could probably get rid of them as well since we're not really

1120
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,200
using that anymore.

1121
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,400
So we've got the offset in there and this guy will be the same.

1122
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,900
So that's a new player P equals offset the old player P with that.

1123
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,200
So that's already much nicer to look at as well.

1124
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,400
So, there we go, and that will just look like that.

1125
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,000
In fact, we don't even need to have new player pee in there at all.

1126
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,800
Now, I don't think this new player P the views.

1127
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,500
It's not, so that's fine.

1128
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,900
Okay, so these guys who are actually accessing the values, that's

1129
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,000
totally fine because they're the rendering code.

1130
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:06,800
So that's fine.

1131
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,400
So now we should be good to go and or not cool way.

1132
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,000
Well today is a horrible day.

1133
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,800
This is like the worst day I've had on the stream.

1134
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,500
I think ever nothing has gone right for me.

1135
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,300
It's been awful the entire time.

1136
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,300
What did I do to deserve this?

1137
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,100
So what what did I do?

1138
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,900
That's what I did.

1139
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,500
Yeah.

1140
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,100
So again, I probably shouldn't even write that.

1141
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,600
That's just a stupid way to write that.

1142
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,000
And that's part of the reason why I deserved that stupidity.

1143
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,700
So, there we go.

1144
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,100
So, basically, now I just have it so, okay.

1145
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Everyone now just does their offsets directly and in theory, that will

1146
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,200
make it a little bit easier to avoid having problems.

1147
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,300
There's still another thing that I would really like to do the thing

1148
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,800
that I want to get to eventually.

1149
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,800
And so, I'm hoping that as we kind of round out how we're doing.

1150
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,400
Stuff over the next couple weeks and finally go.

1151
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:07,700
Okay.

1152
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,000
This is how everything is going to work.

1153
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,600
I'd like to get to the point.

1154
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,300
I mean, the thing that I've been thinking about lately, basically,

1155
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,300
it's just that I'd like to give the point where we don't have these

1156
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,000
all these crazy position things happening anyway, because what I

1157
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,800
wanted to have happen eventually, I'm just not exactly sure how we're

1158
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
going to get there quite yet.

1159
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,700
What I really want to have happen, right?

1160
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,100
Yes.

1161
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:31,900
I want to have it so that when you're kind of, when you're on the area

1162
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,800
of the screen, everyone is just in regular.

1163
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,000
Regular float space.

1164
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,200
And then everyone who's off-screen is in their tile map positions.

1165
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,300
And when you move onto the screen, right?

1166
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,400
You become a floating Point coordinate relative to like the center of

1167
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,000
the screen or something, right?

1168
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,100
That's what I really want to get to because I my intention is I don't

1169
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,600
really want to be using those tile map coordinates at all eventually

1170
00:53:59,600 --> 00:53:59,800
like

1171
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,700
Goal, eventually was to figure out a way to make it so that we always

1172
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,600
map everyone into the float space, do all the game there.

1173
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:11,200
And then when things leave the screen and have to persist that aren't

1174
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,600
relative to the screen, then they go into some kind of cold storage

1175
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,400
where they're just in tile map coordinates.

1176
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,200
That's my goal.

1177
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,100
I'm just not quite sure exactly how we're going to get there yet, but

1178
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,700
I want to assume.

1179
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,200
As we do like, some more of the stuff.

1180
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,200
I'm feeling like, I can probably just make that happen.

1181
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,200
All right, so we're okay.

1182
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,700
Now we're back to we're back to dude, being at parity and we

1183
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,900
accidentally improved our Collision detector quite a bit by fixing a

1184
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,700
bug, which was not my intention, but there we go, and we sort of

1185
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,700
decided that we don't think wrapping is going to be such a good idea.

1186
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:44,800
Now.

1187
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,500
I don't know, it's possible that it like really those were the only

1188
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,500
things we had to fix wrapping by just feel like will end up with tons

1189
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,600
of problems that are happening.

1190
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
If we allow that rapping to continue that we just don't want to have

1191
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:55,900
happen.

1192
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,000
So we may just try to always

1193
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,700
Make it so that you never wrap around.

1194
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,500
You never actually use the toroidal thing for all intents and

1195
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:03,900
purposes.

1196
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,700
It doesn't exist.

1197
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,100
That is probably the best strategy to avoid sadness, but I don't

1198
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,600
actually know.

1199
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,400
So we'll just leave it at that.

1200
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:17,700
So anyway, not a very eventful handmade hero, mostly just a bunch of

1201
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,900
garbage that had to get cleaned out and that's fine that has to happen

1202
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,200
periodically, but tomorrow we'll do the thing that I wanted to do

1203
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,900
today, which is just make the Collision detector properly, handle

1204
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,400
dilated things basically.

1205
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,100
So that you can sort of do the guy can be a shape and the wall can be

1206
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,200
a shape and intersect them together, which is what I wanted to do, but

1207
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,800
was not going to happen, what we go along.

1208
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,700
Also do,

1209
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:46,200
Is is somebody was suggesting perhaps.

1210
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,500
There would be a way to set the default inside the settings.

1211
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,900
There would be a default way to set these colors.

1212
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,300
I don't know if that's actually true but I will take a real quick look

1213
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,100
to see if that actually is true color management.

1214
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:01,300
No, probably not color management.

1215
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:05,000
Ha color, selector settings, shade such a color patches.

1216
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,400
I could make them color patches.

1217
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,000
I suppose, I just want there to be some kind of a default.

1218
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,600
What's your default canvas?

1219
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,800
Order doesn't help.

1220
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:14,500
Yeah.

1221
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,100
Yeah, it doesn't look likely.

1222
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,200
So I think we're kind of

1223
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,300
We're not, we're not in good shape there.

1224
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,300
We're not in good shape, but what you going to do?

1225
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,500
What are you going to do?

1226
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,400
Okay, so I don't imagine they'll be a whole lot of questions, but I

1227
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,400
will go to Q&A.

1228
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,100
Anyway, maybe we'll take some off topic questions because there's

1229
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,500
really not much to talk about.

1230
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:42,200
It was just a basic bug basic debugging day, which I'm sure they'll be

1231
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,500
a lot of on the stream and just haven't had to do them very much

1232
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,900
because I guess the code we've been doing has been simple enough.

1233
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,100
That it hasn't really been the case that I've had to look at stuff

1234
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600
much but

1235
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,800
if you want to go ahead and send me a question, prefixed by Q:, I

1236
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,700
would be delighted to answer it and

1237
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:07,100
And if that question is, why did we have to do that to bugging?

1238
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:14,400
The answer is because I don't know, we were sloppy and now we've got

1239
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,200
some stuff.

1240
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,100
We all now know at least that from now on will avoid using offset

1241
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,100
directly and only people who really need access to it will actually

1242
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,000
access it for now and we'll start doing this way, but I want to get

1243
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,800
out of that habit because really

1244
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,800
I just don't like the fact that that there's constantly this sort of

1245
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,700
interchange between the tile indices and the writer ones.

1246
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,100
And so the way I like to do to level coordinates like that as I always

1247
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,000
like to map everyone into the same space, do whatever the game is

1248
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
going to do and then map everyone out at the end and that way you're

1249
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,500
not worrying about whether you have to canonicalize.

1250
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,300
So this is really even though this is like, you know, you might think.

1251
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:57,600
Oh we encapsulated this a little bit so it's fine really, it's just

1252
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,900
it's just bad and it's not

1253
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,500
Necessary.

1254
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:03,000
And so I want to get to the point where we don't have that anymore as

1255
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,400
well.

1256
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,600
That makes sense.

1257
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,100
Do use diagrams a lot in your actual work, even when it is just for

1258
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:13,700
yourself.

1259
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,100
Only if I'm doing something particularly tricky, I guess.

1260
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,200
But yeah, I draw em diagrams.

1261
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,100
In my notebook when I'm trying to work stuff out.

1262
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
That's that's tricky.

1263
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,900
What do you recommend for learning C++?

1264
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,100
I don't know, to be honest with you.

1265
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,400
A lot of people ask that and first thing I'm the wrong one to ask

1266
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,000
because I learn C++ so long ago that I don't know what the current

1267
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
resources are for it.

1268
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,600
I suspect there's better stuff than when I was learning, but I don't

1269
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:41,900
know.

1270
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,200
Try, setting handmade hero to start at the midpoint between tiles and

1271
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,500
hit down to see if you can slip through.

1272
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,500
So unfortunately, I don't think you can.

1273
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
And the reason is because we're doing a greater than or equal to check

1274
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,600
on the walls, right?

1275
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:05,800
So it's more, it's more difficult than that.

1276
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,800
I believe this is the thing.

1277
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,800
That's getting us, right?

1278
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,800
So you can't slip through the cracks because it actually is covered.

1279
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,900
And so I may be wrong.

1280
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:20,000
This may be watertight.

1281
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,300
I I didn't think it should be.

1282
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,700
I assume that it wouldn't be but I was wrong to bug that we had was a

1283
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,900
totally unrelated bug.

1284
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,500
And so the I was just thought it was that bug because I was kind of

1285
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,600
expecting to have that and I was going to show how to fix it.

1286
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,800
But we really didn't have to do that.

1287
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,100
Now.

1288
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,300
I feel like if we made the Epsilon 0 though, I feel like we still

1289
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,100
could glitch through now, right?

1290
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,100
That's feels like it.

1291
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,200
Probably shouldn't happen.

1292
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,800
But maybe not.

1293
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,700
It might be that that it's so exact at this point because they're

1294
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,100
vertical and horizontal lines, which are really hard to mess up.

1295
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,400
It could be that that's yeah.

1296
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,800
So even with a no Epsilon, it won't go through at this.

1297
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,400
So, I don't know.

1298
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,900
What can I say?

1299
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,600
The Collision sector is better than it should have been.

1300
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,900
It's a good problem to have I suppose.

1301
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,200
But you know.

1302
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,200
What can I say?

1303
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,100
What are your initial thoughts on dx12?

1304
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Well, I like this new trend towards direct like push buffer access

1305
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,400
kinds of things and stuff like that.

1306
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:35,100
So I'm I am thumbs-up on opengl next and DirectX 12, theoretically and

1307
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:40,500
mantle, but I have to actually see the final shipping products.

1308
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,900
First before I can say whether they're good or not because you know,

1309
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,000
there's plenty of room now.

1310
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,900
Between a good idea and a bad implementation, right?

1311
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,200
There's plenty of it could still be lousy or something, right?

1312
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,900
Why is my code over 900 lines?

1313
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,800
I don't know.

1314
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:02,500
What do you mean?

1315
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,800
Because it's 916 lines, I guess.

1316
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,500
How about using signed values for the Tha coordinates starting the

1317
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,100
world at 0, 0, and allowing movement, to - Physicians is just about

1318
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,000
the world array indexing.

1319
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,300
We have now know, like week.

1320
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,400
I mean, yes, in some sense, because the world in this thing, we have

1321
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,400
now is not quite done yet.

1322
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,000
But know we could easily use sine values.

1323
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,100
For what I plan was planning on us doing in terms of those map

1324
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:37,700
lookups.

1325
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,800
Stream went offline.

1326
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,700
Is that Twitter?

1327
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,300
Is that me?

1328
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,800
Why did the stream go offline?

1329
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,200
I guess it doesn't look like I ever went offline.

1330
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:53,700
Huh?

1331
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,100
I wonder if twitch is just Twitchy.

1332
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,100
Why don't you like private?

1333
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,400
Um, I don't like private because some code has to access stuff and

1334
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,300
then I end up being in this situation where I gotta make things

1335
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,100
friends to get at it and all this stuff.

1336
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,900
So I just don't like private.

1337
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,100
What?

1338
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,300
I really just what I like to do is just make a note to myself that

1339
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,300
this is the thing that is only for special occasions.

1340
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,400
And then I'm fine with it.

1341
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,000
Private just gets in my way usually.

1342
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,500
So I don't I just don't use it.

1343
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:35,900
Let's see.

1344
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,100
Is there any background information?

1345
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,600
You can give us new viewers.

1346
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,500
So there's, there's a whole page handmade here a.org that has like a

1347
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,600
ton of information.

1348
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,400
If you want to check it out.

1349
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,600
If you're just new to the series and want to know what's going on.

1350
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,100
I highly recommend checking that out.

1351
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,600
It's got a ton of stuff on it.

1352
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,900
Courtesy rapping.

1353
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,900
Go about float space.

1354
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,500
Do you envision any complications with broadcasting, a sound from the

1355
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,100
float position in the next room?

1356
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,500
So I don't know.

1357
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:14,000
Like I said, I I because I don't like the design things up front.

1358
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,100
So I don't like to say.

1359
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,500
We're going to do X or going to do, why?

1360
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,000
Right?

1361
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,100
The whole reason that we're playing around right now and just kind of

1362
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,900
like feeling out what we want to do is specifically because I'm not

1363
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,000
sure how everything should work.

1364
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,000
So what I what I'm thinking or at least what I've been thinking and

1365
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,300
we'll see.

1366
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,900
What happens is I'm thinking that what will probably do.

1367
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,800
If everything worked out perfectly and I don't know if it will maybe

1368
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,500
it won't.

1369
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,400
If everything worked out perfectly.

1370
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,400
I feel like what we would do is say, okay the game takes place in

1371
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,200
something, you know.

1372
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,300
That looks kind of like this.

1373
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,300
Right?

1374
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:59,800
So it's basically got, you know, your room and maybe like the 3 by 3

1375
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,100
by 3 because it'd be like a cube or whatever the three by three by

1376
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,400
three of the rooms around it.

1377
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,000
Right?

1378
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,400
And all of those are in float, right?

1379
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,000
So your position relative to the center of that is all in float.

1380
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:17,500
And then what happens is when you move right from one room to the next

1381
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,000
there's just

1382
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,000
An event where you move over and the camera changes to here, right?

1383
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,900
And then everybody's position is just updated to be in the new room in

1384
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,700
anyone who falls outside of that, like, who is in here, gets baked

1385
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,000
back out to tile positions.

1386
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,500
And it's just, you know, is now dormant and I'm thinking will still

1387
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:44,000
run, like, high-level AI sorts of stuff on the tile map stuff itself,

1388
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,100
so that they're still all the world is still active, but only

1389
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,300
The stuff in here is actually in float and going at any given time.

1390
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:53,500
That's what I'd like to get to like.

1391
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:59,100
This is like, you know, hearts and and flowers, right?

1392
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:05,200
And bunny, rabbits, you know, I don't know how to draw a bunny rabbits

1393
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,100
necessarily.

1394
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,000
but,

1395
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,700
Something like that.

1396
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,600
Maybe, I don't know.

1397
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,600
That's not a very good bunny rabbit, but you get the idea.

1398
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,700
What is your preferred scripting language when you need it?

1399
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,400
I don't I don't really ever use scripting language.

1400
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,800
I'm curious, if you have to deal with memory misalignment.

1401
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:47,200
Yes, so we will have to do that on the stream, actually, if I, well, I

1402
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,200
don't know what you mean by memory misalignment necessarily, but like,

1403
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,800
we will have to do stuff.

1404
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,100
When we do our allocations to make sure that like, for example, all of

1405
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,800
our stuff that's that uses SSE is aligned properly.

1406
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:04,400
So we will be dealing that lecture later on the stream in when we're

1407
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,400
doing the render and stuff.

1408
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,400
Any reason you're making it somewhat more complicated than it should.

1409
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,000
Yeah, I just don't want to have, I want to be able to have large

1410
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,600
worlds.

1411
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:16,400
Right?

1412
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,500
And I went over this before and basically the problem is, I don't

1413
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,400
really want to use doubles because doubles are half as fast and

1414
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,300
sometimes way more than half as fast way less than half as fast.

1415
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:32,000
So it doubles are bad for performance and I don't want to just use

1416
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,900
floats because if I just use floats, the world can't be that large,

1417
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,300
right?

1418
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,100
And you get that bat like Minecraft.

1419
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,200
Where people walk for a long time in this start jittering or whatever,

1420
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:41,900
right?

1421
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,800
And so I want to make sure that we handle sort of as large of a world

1422
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,200
as you could ever possibly conceivably have.

1423
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:53,800
And so, what I'd like to do is get it so that we're always floats

1424
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,700
locally, right?

1425
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,400
So everything just plays out in floats, in the world locally, but then

1426
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:06,500
things kind of get stored out to the tilemap not as floats, right?

1427
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,200
How are you supposed to draw the game on Windows 10, without a

1428
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,000
hololens?

1429
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,400
So actually

1430
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,200
What you you guys can't see this but the when you're looking I don't

1431
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:22,500
know.

1432
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,100
If you see like out here, this is not real at all.

1433
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,000
Most of this isn't real.

1434
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,500
Like I'm not sitting here programming today because I was busy during

1435
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,600
when the stream of supposed to happen.

1436
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,000
So what I actually did is I took one of the Prototype hololens has

1437
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,300
that I had and I just put it over the webcam and it's just a are

1438
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,000
projecting me, sitting here, talking to you doing the programming,

1439
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,800
right?

1440
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,600
And that's proven to be a pretty

1441
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,300
Way for me to make sure that I always have the stream out on time to

1442
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,200
everyone but so that I but I can also, you know, head out and just,

1443
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,700
you know, hang out at the restaurant for a while and just, you know,

1444
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,800
you know, have a few drinks that kind of thing.

1445
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,600
Just take it easy.

1446
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,000
Is the system rendering off-screen objects in the background?

1447
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:15,700
I'm sorry.

1448
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,300
I'm not sure what you're referring to if you mean in the scheme that I

1449
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:19,100
was just outlining.

1450
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,000
That is what I would like it to do eventually.

1451
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,200
No, you wouldn't bother rendering any of this.

1452
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,100
You you'd leave it unrendered but you'd simulate it.

1453
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,300
Oh, the struct name.

1454
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,300
ABC initialization looks odd and I couldn't find it online.

1455
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:43,800
So what that is is that C++ 11 s way of doing initialization.

1456
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,899
So, basically, in C++ now in their infinite, decimal wisdom, they have

1457
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:53,100
decided that this is how you have to do things if you have a struct

1458
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,700
and you want to declare one of those, right?

1459
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,800
And you don't want to give it a name.

1460
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
You have to do this.

1461
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,100
Right.

1462
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,100
I don't know why they decided that was the case.

1463
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,500
But that's all that is.

1464
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:12,700
That's like a, that's just an inline declaration for in for a C++ 11.

1465
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,300
What's the estimated date for the release of handmade hero?

1466
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,200
Very far in the future.

1467
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,600
I think eyeball parked like two years or something because it goes so

1468
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,500
slowly, I can only do an hour a night.

1469
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:28,700
Right?

1470
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,000
And I'm talking the whole time.

1471
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,800
So I'm programming at not even the speed.

1472
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,800
I would normally program yet.

1473
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,700
So it's, it's going to be a long time.

1474
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,800
However, pair programmed, not really.

1475
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,399
No, I don't know if I have a guest on the stream, but maybe

1476
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,700
Do I go hard in the paint?

1477
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:56,800
Absolutely, I mean, one of the biggest problems is like, you know,

1478
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,500
sometimes I'll just, I'll just straight up file out of a game, you

1479
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:04,500
know, but I want the Defenders to be scared of me.

1480
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,600
You know, I don't want them to think that I'm a guy who's going to be

1481
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,000
in there.

1482
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,100
All like, you know, keeping, you know, having a safety margins.

1483
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,000
Like there's none of that.

1484
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,500
It's all contact, all the time with me.

1485
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,300
Could you remove the old render weird gradient?

1486
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,400
Yeah, I could, I mean, I think we loved it so much, but you know what?

1487
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,900
I will we could get rid of it.

1488
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:26,200
Sad to see it go.

1489
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,000
Why is it such an issue with wrapping?

1490
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,700
Is it because you aren't using World coordinates?

1491
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:41,600
Well, no, it's the issue with wrapping was just because you end up

1492
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,900
with your indices going.

1493
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,300
You can't you can no longer rely on min-max, right?

1494
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,100
So it's nice to be able to use min max and know that you can say like

1495
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:55,800
if I have two locations and I take the minimum of them that I get the

1496
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,900
smaller of the two, right, and that the distance between them will be

1497
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,600
reasonable, but

1498
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,900
What happens if you allow rapping right?

1499
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,900
Is in this case, it may actually be that you'd wrapped around.

1500
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,700
So you've got these two, which means this guy is actually here, which

1501
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,100
means that the Min is this guy and this is the max and the distance

1502
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,000
between them is massive.

1503
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,300
It's like four billion or something, right?

1504
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,300
And so you have to end up writing all your code, much more carefully

1505
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:23,000
to be able to do stuff.

1506
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,100
You can't just do the things that would be intuitive.

1507
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,600
And so, I just don't think that's a very good trade off because we

1508
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,700
don't get anything out of it.

1509
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,600
We already said, we're going to have 4 billion by 4.

1510
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:31,100
Lien world.

1511
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:33,100
We can just put it in the center, and no one would ever be able to

1512
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,000
walk to the edge.

1513
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,200
No matter how long I sat there.

1514
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,000
Where did you get your education at?

1515
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:47,100
I am uneducated and educated.

1516
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,400
To see handle pointers any different than C++.

1517
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,300
No, not not in any oops.

1518
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,400
That's not what I meant to do.

1519
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,900
Not in any meaningful sense.

1520
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,800
Know, there are some things like

1521
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,100
When you're talking about like classes and stuff, like multiple

1522
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,300
inheritance and things like this.

1523
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,700
There's there's things that you could argue are different about

1524
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,200
Pointer handling in C++ potentially, but like basic pointers are the

1525
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:13,600
same.

1526
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:17,800
Do you use Version Control?

1527
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,100
And if not, do you promote it?

1528
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:23,000
Yeah, I mean I do use I always have a system that backs up my files

1529
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,100
like I don't use Version Control hard.

1530
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,200
Like some people like some people are all about like branching all the

1531
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,100
time and doing all these other fancy things.

1532
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:32,800
I don't really ever do any of that.

1533
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,100
But I do use just the basics of Version Control.

1534
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,700
Why not change?

1535
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,000
The tile widths and Heights to 8 and 16 as the closest powers of 2, to

1536
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,200
still allowed to Royal world.

1537
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,700
That won't cause camera issues.

1538
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,600
Well, that's a note.

1539
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,900
So the reason I don't want to do that is because basically wrapping

1540
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:57,400
just isn't important, like we don't have any reason that we actually

1541
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,200
need wrapping.

1542
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,700
And we're not even talking about the world rapping, like we can still

1543
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,100
Implement World rapping in the sense of the player would experience

1544
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,700
rapping by just saying, okay, this tile Maps over here like so

1545
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:10,900
Step onto it.

1546
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:12,800
It just works you over to the other side or something, right?

1547
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,000
We could totally do that.

1548
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,900
But in terms of actually having the map itself be toroidal thing.

1549
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,500
It doesn't get us anything to have that be true.

1550
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:24,300
And so since we don't get anything, it seems like a bad decision.

1551
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:29,500
To make a gameplay restriction, which is what the map size would be

1552
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,600
make a gameplay, restriction out of it, just so we can get some

1553
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,800
feature in the engine that we don't even care about, right.

1554
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,500
So what I'd rather do is say the game can pick whatever it wants its

1555
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,200
base to pick 1617 by 9 because that's better for gameplay.

1556
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
And who knows what we'll pick?

1557
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,400
We may change that, right?

1558
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,400
That's just what we had it set to buy.

1559
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,200
Now, think that's like a Zelda issue number.

1560
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,600
That's that's why.

1561
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,000
Can you explain how you use?

1562
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,500
Makowski addition to your polygon Circle Collision system?

1563
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,700
Yes, we'll do that tomorrow though.

1564
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,000
Basically all we're going to do.

1565
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,800
I mean, the first thing we'll do is the very simple one.

1566
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,100
I don't know if I bother doing the circles yet because we may say that

1567
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,400
for the full Collision detector past that we do when we're writing the

1568
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,000
engine proper, but all you need to think about it.

1569
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,600
It's very easy.

1570
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,800
If you want to do a minkowski sum of two, rectangles, it's the same as

1571
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,600
putting sweeping that rectangle around and just making a bigger

1572
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,200
rectangle, right?

1573
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,600
And you'll see, it's very easy.

1574
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,600
If you just do the same shape unrotated,

1575
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,600
It's very, very easy to implement and I can show you, I'll show you

1576
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,800
tomorrow, very simple way to implement.

1577
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,400
It's very, it's very basic, it gets harder.

1578
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,100
The reason it gets harder as when you want to start to do fancier

1579
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:36,600
things.

1580
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,900
So when we do the full closure sector will be handling more stuff

1581
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,200
like, oh, you know, I don't know that.

1582
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:46,200
Well, Bob, I don't know that will actually ever have rotating

1583
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:51,000
Collision volumes in our game, but we might and we want to and the

1584
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
system that will probably end up using will support them anyway, but,

1585
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,500
at the very least, like having Circle,

1586
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:59,500
And in squares and ellipses and stuff like that is something that you

1587
01:14:59,500 --> 01:14:59,800
can.

1588
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Think about, it's definitely much harder than just doing say

1589
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,200
rectangles systems of axis, aligned rectangles, but we're going to I'm

1590
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,100
going to at least show the rectangle case tomorrow, because really

1591
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,300
quick and then we'll save the rest of it.

1592
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,000
Potentially, for when we do the full question doctor.

1593
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,600
Are you eventually going to add tile entities?

1594
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:27,000
So after we do the animation control stuff like after we get basically

1595
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,800
like we're pretty close actually because the Collision detector is the

1596
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,200
last kind of finicky thing there.

1597
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,600
The next up we're going to do is basically like having some guys

1598
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,900
moving around the screen that interact with each other, so that we can

1599
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,300
start to work up towards that stuff.

1600
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:39,600
I'm sorry about where everyone maps in and Float space, and then Maps

1601
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,600
out, and that sort of stuff.

1602
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,700
After we do that, then we'll move on to actually, spec'ing out how

1603
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:50,300
we're going to do the world stuff and that's when we'll start doing.

1604
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,000
Happening on those tiles because I want to basically start building

1605
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,500
the maps.

1606
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,400
And the reason we didn't do that back when we first got the Tom a

1607
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,100
purring is be working as we hadn't have vectors yet at all.

1608
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,500
And so I want to do vectors.

1609
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,900
I thought the easier way to start with vectors with just have one or

1610
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:06,500
two things because when we start doing World building with vectors is

1611
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,300
going to be a little more complicated, we're going to have a lot of

1612
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,200
stuff that's going on there.

1613
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:09,600
So,

1614
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,600
How much Focus are you going to be showing towards tile entities?

1615
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,100
I'm not sure.

1616
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,600
I know exactly what the phrase tile.

1617
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,700
Entities means, though.

1618
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,000
I'm not even sure that we'll really have much of a tile map in the end

1619
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:27,500
game.

1620
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:33,400
Like basically, I just felt like maybe tile map is the easiest way for

1621
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,900
us to generate the world, but we may not it may not really look very

1622
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,700
tilemap e at the end, so we'll see.

1623
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,300
And and we may just ditch the tilemap thing altogether.

1624
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:42,800
I don't know.

1625
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:48,700
So we will see when we actually do the world map pass, where we're

1626
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,900
really creating the world.

1627
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,700
We will see where we end up because I don't know the answers to a lot

1628
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,500
of those questions.

1629
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,900
It's my first time making a 2d, like walk around a game like this,

1630
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,500
almost everything else I've ever done is full 3d.

1631
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So it's pretty, it's pretty educational for me to go through this

1632
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
because I get to see like, how do I want to handle all of these things

1633
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:08,800
and I'm not sure yet.

1634
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,300
So I'm, you know, as I go.

1635
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:11,900
I kind of player I'll be playing around and going.

1636
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:12,500
Oh, I like this.

1637
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:13,200
I don't like this.

1638
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,000
How tall are you?

1639
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,600
I'm 6 foot and about like a 3/4 of an inch.

1640
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,800
Maybe not quite 61.

1641
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,500
What if you translate a 9x9 tile grid to the player as origin before

1642
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,900
doing any world math?

1643
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:42,800
Yeah.

1644
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,200
I mean, like I said, that's kind of what I want to do.

1645
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,800
Basically like we'll be getting

1646
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,800
We will figure out something, right?

1647
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,900
Something.

1648
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,900
will be figured out but I'm just not sure what it is yet because

1649
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
Still kind of building the basic stuff that we're playing with.

1650
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,000
And, until we're done with that.

1651
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,200
It really won't be possible for me to say definitively.

1652
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,200
What I want to have happen.

1653
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,000
What do I use to draw create data?

1654
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,700
Oops.

1655
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,800
Creature with a Wacom.

1656
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,000
What is this?

1657
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:29,500
What is this thing in 2003 Graphics tablet?

1658
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,600
In 20s.

1659
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,300
How you spell that?

1660
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,900
20s, who knows a Wacom tablet.

1661
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:40,800
Let's leave it at that.

1662
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,700
For rapping, you could just check if the new value is between you and

1663
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Max and the nearest house multiple of 9 17 that subtract the

1664
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:58,400
difference.

1665
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,000
Well, no, you couldn't though because you have to do that for the

1666
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,500
entities as well and the camera.

1667
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,800
It's just it's very janky at that point.

1668
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,300
Right?

1669
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,800
It's not a good situation.

1670
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,200
Can you explain what float space is exactly for us?

1671
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,800
Newbies?

1672
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:17,500
Sure.

1673
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,000
so,

1674
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,300
here's the deal.

1675
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,500
Inside a computer, right?

1676
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:29,800
You've got integers.

1677
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,500
Which is a way of coding numbers.

1678
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,400
Such that you have some number of bits in them.

1679
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:37,700
Right?

1680
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:38,800
Like 32 bits.

1681
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:43,100
Let's say would be a typical number and they're stored are mapped to

1682
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:48,300
the numbers 0, through something to, to whatever the number of bits

1683
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:48,600
is.

1684
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,800
So 2 to the 32nd, in the case of an insurer that sort of tube.

1685
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,800
It's actually two or three s minus one.

1686
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,400
Because it can't store that final one.

1687
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:56,900
Right?

1688
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:01,200
But there's also floating Point numbers and what floating point

1689
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,100
A are floating Point numbers are way of using the bits inside your

1690
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,400
computer right to actually talk about numbers that are not just

1691
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:12,800
integers that are not just whole numbers, 0, 1, 2 3, right?

1692
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,200
Whatever that don't necessarily have even spaces in between them and

1693
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:21,300
which are allow you to sort of specify things small, or large,

1694
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:25,500
depending on how the circumstance depending on what the circumstances

1695
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,000
that are storing them.

1696
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,500
So, what they do is instead of taking all 32 bits and just using them

1697
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,100
to encode,

1698
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:31,900
An integer.

1699
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:38,200
They split it up and they encode an exponent as part of it and a

1700
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,100
mantissa as part of it.

1701
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,000
Right?

1702
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,400
And those are actually very much like the scientific notation.

1703
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,800
You may have seen in school, right?

1704
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,100
Where people say something like oh, this is 3.12 for e to the fifth or

1705
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,500
whatever.

1706
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,700
You know what I'm talking about where they do that that scientific

1707
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,300
notation nonsense, which is basically saying I'm always writing

1708
01:20:59,300 --> 01:20:59,800
everything.

1709
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,700
One number, and then the, the trailing digits as decimal, and then I'm

1710
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,400
telling you how many, you know, where to move the decimal, point to

1711
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,200
the right.

1712
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,200
That's how they're encoded.

1713
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,300
And that allows it to basically float, which is the name of it float,

1714
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,500
where that decimal point is so that you can represent things that are

1715
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:23,100
very tiny or very large with the same kind of encoding and things,

1716
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,700
don't have to be evenly spaced like they are integer land or anything

1717
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,300
like that.

1718
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,700
So the problem with floating point

1719
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,700
Is precision, right?

1720
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,100
You have a Precision problem?

1721
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,600
Because what happens with floating Point numbers as you might expect,

1722
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:41,400
just like with with that scientific notation, right?

1723
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,600
If I have a limited number of digits, I could store, which is

1724
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,200
basically what happens when you're talking about a 32-bit number or

1725
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,400
something.

1726
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:47,800
That computer.

1727
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,700
I have a limited amount of information there, right?

1728
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,100
If I had a limited amount of information and I've got, you know, that

1729
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:57,900
3.125 E2 the six or whatever, right.

1730
01:21:57,900 --> 01:21:59,800
If I've got something like this, if I

1731
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,500
Only have say four digits to represent, then what that means is if I

1732
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:08,100
was at a to the zero or write or e to the negative 1 or something,

1733
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,700
right?

1734
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,700
Then I actually have quite a bit of precision in my 3.125, in terms of

1735
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,800
how big the smallest thing movement.

1736
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,800
I'm representing is because what is 3.125?

1737
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,500
E to the negative 1.

1738
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,300
Well, it's Point 3:1-5 a very small value, right?

1739
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,800
And so, what's my Precision there?

1740
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,300
Well, my Precision is all the way out to four decimal points, right?

1741
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,100
Four decimal places.

1742
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,800
That's pretty small that I can support.

1743
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:30,900
They're right.

1744
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,700
But now, let's say it was E10, right?

1745
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,600
Is what I was doing.

1746
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,900
Well, now, I've got to move that decimal, place, 10, places this way,

1747
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,900
and it's like three 125000, write something like this.

1748
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,000
And now what's the smallest thing?

1749
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:45,900
I can represent?

1750
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,900
Well, the smallest thing I can represent Now is really huge.

1751
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,800
It's like 5 million or something.

1752
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:51,400
Right?

1753
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:56,800
And so the problem is just like if you only have a certain number of

1754
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,300
significant figures in your, in your any number here, floating Point

1755
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,900
values and computer suffer from the exact same problem as they get

1756
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:04,600
larger.

1757
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:09,500
They become less precise until eventually you get artifacts from that.

1758
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,200
Right?

1759
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,700
And the artifacts that you would get is.

1760
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:17,600
- right because as I like, you know, if as my as I'm talking about,

1761
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,700
say, I've got a dude, you know, you're playing Minecraft or something,

1762
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,400
right?

1763
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,900
Here's my Minecraft world, right?

1764
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,900
And I start out at the beginning of my Minecraft world and I start

1765
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:29,900
walking in this direction.

1766
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:33,000
And I walk in this direction, for a very, very long time, like days or

1767
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:33,900
whatever, right?

1768
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,800
And I start getting out very far.

1769
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,400
And now, all of a sudden, the camera starts being kind of jerky.

1770
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,000
And my position kind of starts wobbling back and forth or something,

1771
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:41,700
right?

1772
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,700
Well, what's happening?

1773
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,900
There is the position of the player got so large that the actual

1774
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:50,700
distance that the actual Precision of where it could remember that you

1775
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,400
were standing is now, so great that you can see the Gap.

1776
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,700
You can see the jump between any of those two positions, right?

1777
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,200
And stuff starts to go really wrong.

1778
01:23:59,600 --> 01:23:59,800
And so,

1779
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I wanted to do in this game just to show really it's for educational

1780
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,400
purposes.

1781
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,600
Like we could write this game without it, but for educational

1782
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,100
purposes.

1783
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,500
I wanted you to basically watch me.

1784
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,000
That's the worst handwriting.

1785
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Let's try that one more time.

1786
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,600
And you.

1787
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,400
Occasional.

1788
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,600
Purposes.

1789
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,500
For educational purposes.

1790
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,300
I wanted you to be able to watch me kind of struggle through it and

1791
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,400
have to deal with all the complexities that arise from allowing giant

1792
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,300
things and trying to do them in a way that was still going to be

1793
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,500
performance-critical, not by just saying doubles.

1794
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,400
Let's switch to doubles, which are floating Point numbers, which have

1795
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,000
twice, the Precision because doubles are very slow.

1796
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:44,900
Right?

1797
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:49,200
And so, we want to do is try to use floats, because they're at least 2

1798
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,500
X2 speed, if not faster.

1799
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,300
Oftentimes much faster.

1800
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,800
And so, we want to do is see if we can do that.

1801
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,400
Again, for educational purposes.

1802
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,700
We wouldn't have to do that for this game.

1803
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:05,000
We could just, we could probably still make plenty large worlds for

1804
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,600
the average player, but it might be fun.

1805
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,200
When since we're doing the work, it'll be fun for people to make these

1806
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:11,500
worlds.

1807
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:14,200
That it takes them seven months to play through.

1808
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,200
I don't know who's going to have the stamina for that but

1809
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,200
Will you create a map editor then know?

1810
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,100
It's a procedurally.

1811
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:22,900
Generated game.

1812
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,300
So there won't really be a map editor.

1813
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,200
/ say the maps will be generated every time.

1814
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,900
Catching up with the past.

1815
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,000
Video seems like you could use bit Fields or a union to

1816
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,200
simultaneously, have abs tile tile chunk Rel tile in the tile structs.

1817
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,200
Is that something that makes sense to do?

1818
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,300
I don't think so, but I may not be understanding what you're asking.

1819
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:51,800
Exactly.

1820
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:59,300
Noob question, what's the best way to learn how to code?

1821
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:00,200
I don't know.

1822
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,000
That's a good question.

1823
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,800
When I started out.

1824
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,100
I learned basic first and basic isn't really something that even super

1825
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,500
exists commonly today.

1826
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:09,800
I mean, there are Basics out there but they're not like things that

1827
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,900
receive a lot of development effort or anything like that.

1828
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,600
And so I don't know.

1829
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,300
I think the best way to learn to code is whatever you're motivated to

1830
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:16,700
do.

1831
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,800
So go, like, grab a unity game or something in or a moddable game and

1832
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25,100
hack on it a bit like in an easy language like or gamemaker, something

1833
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:25,900
that's like design.

1834
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,100
Just allow you to write a little bit of code and get some results.

1835
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,300
I would say that's probably the easiest way to get into it.

1836
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,300
And then when like, you're ready to kind of Step Up to more serious

1837
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:36,500
programming than learn C or C++ or something.

1838
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:46,200
I thought floats and doubles with the same speed in your FB, you know,

1839
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:51,800
they aren't so basically in you've got a couple of different widths.

1840
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,200
So what happens is,

1841
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,300
Right.

1842
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,900
Typically, the operation is that you're going to do in.

1843
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,500
Any in any math?

1844
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:06,500
Intensive, stuff is going to be something where you where you've got

1845
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:14,000
for either 4X, 8X or 16x floats at a time.

1846
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,600
So, basically, what will happen is you'll have four floats ABC, and d

1847
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,500
and you will add them to four other floats d e f and g or something.

1848
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,500
And you'll do that.

1849
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,400
And that will take like, that'll be like a two-cycle, throughput thing

1850
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,000
or something.

1851
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:27,900
Right?

1852
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,800
So you'll do for floats into Cycles.

1853
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,600
It's roughly something like that.

1854
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,200
If you're talking a vxr avx2.

1855
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,100
It's a 8X or 16x.

1856
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,100
Right?

1857
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,900
If you do doubles, if you switch the doubles, you can only do two at a

1858
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,300
time.

1859
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,800
So if you do doubles, you would only have a and b.

1860
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:48,300
So then you would be doing 2 x into Cycles.

1861
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:48,900
Right?

1862
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,200
So basically, it's half the speed.

1863
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:55,900
Anytime you do doubles, you take an immediate half speed, hit to

1864
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,700
switch to doubles.

1865
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,700
so, the only time you would want to do that is

1866
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,800
Well, I mean you might just do it because you don't care and that's

1867
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:08,400
totally fine, too.

1868
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,400
You might be like, you know what, it's just easier to write the code

1869
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,500
this way and I don't think the speed is going to be a problem.

1870
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,700
That's one totally valid thing.

1871
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:24,600
Another way is if the work that you're doing to stay in float is more.

1872
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:28,500
Complicated is more than twice as complicated, right?

1873
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,900
As what you would be doing in doubles, then it was a lose.

1874
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,900
So you're right about the memory footprint.

1875
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,800
The memory footprint is obviously always a problem in that doubles.

1876
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,100
Take twice the amount of space.

1877
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,600
So that is always a problem.

1878
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,000
So it's their cash on friendly as well.

1879
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:48,400
But even just, before you start thinking about cash affects their half

1880
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,000
the speed.

1881
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:51,800
All right.

1882
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,100
We're at the end of the questions and it's the end of the time.

1883
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,600
That is some really, really good.

1884
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,500
All right, so that's pretty good.

1885
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:00,500
Alright everyone.

1886
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:04,200
Thank you very much for joining me for another episode of handmade

1887
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:04,600
hero.

1888
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,100
It has been a pleasure coding with you.

1889
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,800
Unfortunately, today was just a pretty straightforward bug day, but

1890
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,700
that's totally fine.

1891
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,000
We haven't had one yet really for the most part.

1892
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,100
So that was pretty good tomorrow.

1893
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,400
We'll do Collision detection since we don't really have any reason not

1894
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:17,500
to.

1895
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,800
Now we've sorted out the things that we want to sort out today.

1896
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:22,600
So that's done.

1897
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,900
And so basically, we should be able to implement our up, a big

1898
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,500
Collision detection, and that will be basically the end of the

1899
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,600
Collision detection for now.

1900
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,100
I don't think we really have anything else that we super need to do.

1901
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,600
And so then we'll probably move on to just getting a couple things on

1902
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,000
the screen doing different stuff.

1903
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,000
So we can start to look at like some animation, basically is what I'd

1904
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
like to do going forwards.

1905
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,600
So if you're interested in that, please join our in the Clinton,

1906
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,900
please join me tomorrow at 9 a.m.

1907
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,000
Pacific Standard time for our for Europe, Friendly Feed and

1908
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,800
Then of course, we'll be back here at 8:00 p.m.

1909
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,100

You can use every night to download the source code after I finish

1918
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,200
coding.

1919
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,600
And we also have a couple of.

1927
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,600
If you're trying to follow along on a different platform.

1928
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,200
There's a good place to go and then there's also a discussion board

1929
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:36,700
like a forum.

1930
