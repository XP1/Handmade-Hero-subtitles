00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,100
Welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,800
Show, we code a complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,800
We are right in the middle of doing our cutscene sequence, so I'd like

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,900
to go into that.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,000
We kind of stopped to cut sheets, cutscenes short of the finale

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
yesterday, and we want to go ahead and do those today.

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,800
So, if you are programming along at home today, stay 223.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,200
So, if you would like to join me, please unpack day, 222 source code.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,800
If you preorder the game on handmade hirota org unpacked a

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,500
two 22s.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,100
That's what I'm starting with today.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,800
Just to refresh your memory if you choose me.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
Don't remember?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,800
This is where we were at yesterday.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,800
We basically made a series of cutscenes here and we've got them all

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,700
lined up in one file and we just kind of can pick in the code which

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,500
one we want to use.

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
We had a file called handmade cutscene, right?

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,300
And it's just got, you know, basically the simple little Logic for

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,400
each of our cutscenes here and we can go ahead and jump down to the

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,200
last one we did which was shot nine.

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,500
You can kind of see, it's just kind of zooming in on the little kid

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,300
who's going off to his room.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:17,100
And yeah, so looking at all that I need to now make a shot 10 and a

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,500
shot 11 and that's it.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,400
That'll be the end of it once we do that.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
So I'll go ahead and paste that in here.

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,900
Shot 10 and we'll start off with only one layer of that shot.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,200
You can kind of see that this one and again I should probably go to

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,300
what we were doing before.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,000
Just make one one little window because, you know, we've got the Live

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,100
code editing stuff going.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,200
I can just kind of tweak the parameters here, so I'm just going to go

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
ahead and load that up.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Here's can made cutscene.

36
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,300
So there's our first layer.

37
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,100
Now you can see that's kind of a sky layer, right?

38
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,400
So that one probably should be one of those layers.

39
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,000
It's like really far away or whatever in the background and let's go

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
ahead and move it back there.

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know how big we want it yet, but that's definitely going to

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,600
feature that flag where we have the scene layer flag, add infinity so

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,300
that it doesn't move at.

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,900
All right.

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,000
So just kind of stationary.

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go ahead and add it and how big we want that yet?

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
Let's go ahead and add another one.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,100
So there it is.

49
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm going to

50
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,100
This one, I don't know what motion the cameras going to have I suppose

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,500
is going to zoom a little bit I suspect so I'm just going to leave

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,300
that zoom in there probably it's probably not going to be that much to

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,200
me but so let's go ahead and make that happen.

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,700
All right, so let's see what we want.

55
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,200
The size of that to be, we presumably want this to be, maybe about 10

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
meters away, something like that.

57
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,900
Something kind of back in the distance, probably needs to be a little

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,700
larger.

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,300
Maybe not quite that large.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:44,400
See

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,300
See here, maybe something like that.

62
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:46,600
I don't know.

63
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,500
We'll see you in a second.

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,100
Okay, so that's looking out the window and you can see that the sky is

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,500
a little bit janky there as well, so I'm going to try moving that

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:55,900
over.

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
I'd probably need to move it over quite a bit.

68
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Several meters to line it up.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,300
With the window, which is what we want, something like that.

70
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,500
And I'll have to move it up at two teeny bit as well.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Let's go ahead and get that going.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
Let's see, there we are.

73
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,500
So that looks probably about right, I don't know, maybe not, I'm not

74
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,100
entirely sure what's going on there.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
So we'll find out in a second when we when we kind of put some more

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,100
layers in here.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,800
So there is a little hero, dude, standing on is little his little

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,700
You know, she's a little step stool, right?

79
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,700
And I'm going to go ahead and move him kind of over a little bit

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,300
because he's too far over.

81
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,800
See that looks more correct?

82
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,500
Maybe a little more Center than that, not sure.

83
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,100
But we'll find out in a second but otherwise that's about right?

84
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,100
That's pretty good.

85
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,600
I don't know if you actually know, I think about it.

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,900
He may need to be back a little further, so,

87
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm not sure maybe he should be more like negative 5.

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,400
Oops sorry more like negative 3.

89
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,500
That seems pretty good.

90
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, no, I don't really know.

91
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,600
So we'll drop another layer in there and we'll find out.

92
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:26,700
So here's the doors and I don't mean the band for those of you that

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,600
are into like sort of hard rock sorts of stuff, right?

94
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
So let's see here.

95
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,100
Let's let's get that going.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
So there is the doors.

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And so, what I want to do is I want to make sure those doors are kind

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:38,900
of

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,500
Lock blocking out.

100
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,100
You know that they should be big like the screen is right.

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,100
So I got a I got a size those up so that they don't ever have any

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,700
gapping, I'm going to go ahead and do the same trick that I was doing

103
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,500
before where I just kind of lock it to the initial shot so I can size

104
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,400
that properly.

105
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,900
So let's let's just make that get a little bigger.

106
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
There we go and so that's how that should look.

107
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
And so now the kid is obviously too small at that point.

108
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,900
So this is good this little sort of let me figure.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,200
Her out how big he needs to be which is what I would like to do.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
So let's make him a little larger, something like that.

111
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,500
That's probably a reasonable.

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,100
Maybe let's see here.

113
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,500
Yeah.

114
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,900
Yeah.

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Something like that.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm not totally sure exactly what should be there but we'll see how it

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,400
looks.

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,300
Pretty good, looks pretty good so far.

119
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,900
Okay, so we're going to go ahead and add layer 5.

120
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,400
To the mix.

121
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,400
So this is all of his hat, his hat collection, right?

122
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,300
Because he spends a lot of time on Steam so he has a lot of hats but

123
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,800
he's purchased, you know,

124
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,000
Very important part adding customer value via hats.

125
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,100
So there we go, get those hats in there.

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,200
And those I want to size again, kind of, so that they're just about

127
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,800
the size of the screen.

128
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,100
I think something like that.

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,200
So I'm going to move those down like so.

130
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,600
Here we go.

131
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
And yeah.

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,800
So and then we've got one more layer to add in here.

133
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,600
I believe there's one more.

134
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,600
Yeah, and so there's that final layer so that's gotta be placed and

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,900
scaled up as well.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,700
Let's get that in there.

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
I think that once entered.

138
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,700
So there we go and it's a little smaller than that, probably in

139
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,400
actuality.

140
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm guessing maybe not entirely sure, not entirely sure.

141
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,300
But that's probably good.

142
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
Yeah, that's, that's about right.

143
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,800
Okay, so let's see how that looks.

144
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Let's try and get the zoom right now.

145
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,500
So there's there's sort of the more Parallax bit happening.

146
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,600
I feel like maybe there wants to be a little more depth to that as the

147
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,700
zoom kind of happens.

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,900
So I feel like maybe that we're not we're just not separated enough in

149
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,100
terms of our sort of spatial placement of these guys.

150
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,900
And so I kind of feel like maybe we want this to be a more exaggerated

151
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,300
fall off.

152
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,900
So I feel like we maybe want something, you know more, wait a minute,

153
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,300
what's going?

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,900
They're okay.

155
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,100
Those are both at three.

156
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,100
Okay, so we want maybe like something like that.

157
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,900
Sort of a thing.

158
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,400
And I'm just trying to think about if that'll be enough of a

159
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,900
difference in what happens?

160
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,600
I feel like that will probably be enough.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Kind of hard to say.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,300
I would like there to be a reasonable different, so maybe I really

163
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,200
just need to make this guy be like closer and so that because I want

164
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
there to be a lot of motion.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,800
And, you know, at the current way that it is, it wouldn't probably be

166
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,500
all that much.

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Let's see here.

168
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,600
So if this guy were even closer, so let's say this guy starts at 0.5,

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,500
right?

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,400
This guy starts at 1 and these guys are at to something like that and

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,600
then I just kind of resize them down.

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
To be wherever.

173
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,700
Let's see her to normal 20.

174
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,200
Let's see.

175
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,799
So if that's the case and I want these guys to be sized, okay, we

176
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,100
could cut that guy down and that's a little bit more like it.

177
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,700
You can cut that guy down as well and that's a little more like it and

178
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,500
we've got to reduce that a little bit.

179
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,400
Something like this might be a little too much.

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,000
There we go.

181
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,900
And those doors, those doors can't

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,500
No more.

183
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,400
So those are going to have to be a little bit more as well.

184
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,500
So that's maybe like that.

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,000
So let's see if that's any good.

186
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
Let's just get that go.

187
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,000
All right, that's feeling better to me, that's definitely feeling

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,900
better and I feel like maybe the kid, the kid in the door, just I

189
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,400
don't know, maybe the kid in the door should be slightly separated as

190
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,400
well, just slightly so instead of them both being at the same, like

191
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,900
maybe they're more like this.

192
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,100
We're like maybe the kids actually a little bit closer than the door

193
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000
even I don't know.

194
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm not sure.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Something like that.

196
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Hmm, I don't know.

197
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,500
Like I could.

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,100
I could do it.

199
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,600
The problem is, of course, these will get drawn in the wrong order

200
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,500
which is not fabulous because I had them sorted the other way because

201
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,600
I was figuring it would be in front but I don't know.

202
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,100
I mean I could also do it the this way around.

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
So the doors are there in the kids further back, right?

204
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,400
And that's another again.

205
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Just another way of getting depth into it.

206
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,600
So, I don't know, we'll see.

207
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,300
All right, so that's where we're at so far and I feel like that's

208
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,000
pretty good.

209
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,400
We do need to scale up the background a bit as a result.

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,700
It's not going to be enough the way it is because it's got its

211
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,400
actually got to go out to the bleed there.

212
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,200
So that's got to be a little bit.

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,900
It's got to be a little bit larger which means that this one does as

214
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,300
well, right?

215
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,300
Something like that.

216
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,400
So let's see.

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,900
How's that looking so far.

218
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,400
It feels a little bit better.

219
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah.

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, I'm pretty pleased with that.

221
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,500
All right, so if we go ahead and just make this now, dive a little bit

222
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,100
more like the camera dive a little bit more reasonably towards the

223
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,800
kid, right?

224
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Because we want it to sort of be zooming in on him.

225
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
He's the, the point of Interest are.

226
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,700
So yeah, if we kind of make it Zoom a little bit more towards him than

227
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,100
it's a little more reasonable now.

228
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,200
Unfortunately, we get that one thing that moves towards the near

229
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,700
clipping plane.

230
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,900
I don't know if you saw that, so it sort of disappears.

231
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,200
So we probably need to

232
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:49,500
Sure.

233
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,100
That's that's up a little more than it is right now, that's that

234
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,000
closed layer needs to make.

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,500
We need to make sure that's off the screen by the time it hits.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
Because otherwise we're going to have that sort of disk discontinuous

237
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
sort of jump, right?

238
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,400
But otherwise I think that's looking pretty good so far.

239
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,800
Yeah, and I don't know, I think the kid may be nice to be just a

241
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
little bit larger potentially, just, it just a teats.

242
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Oops, that's the wrong one.

243
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,100
There we go.

244
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Maybe we need a little bit of upward motion.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I will look less.

246
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,200
All right, so I'm pretty happy with that.

247
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,400
That seems pretty reasonable to me.

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,100
Yeah, not really much else to say about that.

249
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Seems pretty good.

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,300
Yeah.

251
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,400
It's got kind of a nice feeling of depth to it.

252
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I think it's pretty good.

253
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,900
It looks like we're still may be getting a little bit too much of a

254
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
gap on that background layer.

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,400
So I'm just going to make that just a little bit bigger so just to

256
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,200
make sure that it doesn't bleed at all and I'm pretty happy with that.

257
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,100
All right.

258
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,200
Okay.

259
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
So now we just need our very last one, which is shot 11.

260
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,200
And so then we can assemble these all after we get shot 11 and we can

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,100
assemble these all into a single cutscene, which is pretty cool.

262
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,300
That's what we want.

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,400
And I'm going to go ahead and straighten this out again, just to get

264
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,000
us back to sort of a nominal level.

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,800
So, yeah, this is again, the same.

266
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,800
This is a, this sort of this shot is basically the same

267
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,000
As the opening shot, kind of a shot, it's like a layered Hillside kind

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
of a thing looking look at thing.

269
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,400
So, again, the background is going to be placed at Infinity.

270
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,600
So I'm just going to go ahead and again, the Z value doesn't really

271
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,100
matter because the things placed at Infinity but I set it at - 100

272
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,300
just so that we it doesn't, you know, I guess I don't really need set

273
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,600
at.

274
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
I don't even know why I said 900.

275
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,500
There was no point probably if the renderer ever sorted things by Z,

276
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,000
which we might

277
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,500
You in the future, we want them to sort properly.

278
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,800
So it needs to have a value that will be behind everyone else.

279
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,300
That's, that's really the only requirement, okay?

280
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,900
So let's go ahead and set up the layer 4:30 to.

281
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,900
So there's another one.

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,200
And I'm going to go ahead and turn off the zoom for a second just so

283
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
we can kind of lock it down.

284
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,800
So I'm going to go ahead and scale that back so I can see what it

285
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,200
looks like.

286
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,600
So this is just Hills with kind of like the spooky Forest light in the

287
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:59,800
back there and so I'm going to scale that up maybe a bit more like so.

288
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,100
And you can kind of see that's clipped off the top, which means that

289
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
this thing has to kind of be up a bit unfortunately.

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oops, not that one.

291
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,100
It would be nice if all these layers had were complete but some of

292
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,200
them are obviously.

293
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,300
So there's that part of it.

294
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,200
Next, I'm going to have to load in another one here.

295
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,100
So that I don't know what we probably want that to be at, I'm guessing

296
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,300
that should actually probably pretty far away.

297
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know how far away, exactly.

298
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
But probably pretty far away if that makes sense.

299
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,800
Maybe like that for now and so maybe this one, is it - 40 or

300
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
something?

301
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,600
I don't know.

302
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,800
So let's go ahead and spread that new layer in here.

303
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,200
So there's another layer that one will kind of put up to its normal

304
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
size there again.

305
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,700
There it is, and yeah, that needs to be just a tad bigger.

306
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,100
So something like that.

307
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,000
And it needs to be moved up a

308
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
As well.

309
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
So something like

310
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
something like that.

311
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,300
All right.

312
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,200
And so there's the next layer of Hills.

313
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Now we have, you know, yet another layer coming in of hills

314
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,400
There we go.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,300
And you can see that this is sort of a more.

316
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,900
It's off to the the other side, right?

317
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:33,800
Oops.

318
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Try and get that in there.

319
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,400
So I don't know exactly how big that one should be.

320
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,600
But that is yeah, that's what we're going for.

321
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,700
So it needs to be kind of lifted up to the top of the screen,

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
obviously, and also probably moved over a bit.

323
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,300
So that it touched its, the, this like kind of sitting on the right,

324
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,500
the right side, right?

325
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,300
And yet now let's just take a quick look.

326
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,800
Oops.

327
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,800
Let's just take a quick look at what that looks like Zoom wise, right.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,500
So we're not getting very much Parallax there at all.

329
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,400
There's hardly any difference between those.

330
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,099
Now we could make ourselves move more, right?

331
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,400
We can, we can crank up the motion to kind of see it a little bit more

332
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,300
pronounced, but you can kind of see that there's really just not that

333
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
much difference there.

334
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,200
So I wonder if we want to try when we're sort of setting these up.

335
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
I wonder if you want to do more like a half, a half a half kind of a

336
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,300
thing.

337
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Let's see how many layers we've actually got here.

338
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,700
What's when do we get to one?

339
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:33,900
That's

340
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Actually pretty close.

341
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,100
I don't know.

342
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,400
So there's that.

343
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,400
See what 6 looks like.

344
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,600
so, I think that must be the

345
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Foreground most one guessing and let's take a look at what the seven

346
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,700
players up that is up kid.

347
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Yeah, okay.

348
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,800
So we kind of know how much there are here.

349
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
We know that this is the kid but we know that these are all the layers

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that we have to have.

351
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,400
And so I'm going to kind of I'm going to try just doing it.

352
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Where will maybe do sort of like a doubling and so maybe this one is

353
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,300
like, you know, five meters away.

354
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:25,700
Oops.

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Maybe this one is like five meters away since 10:00.

356
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,400
This is one, this is 20.

357
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,900
This is 40.

358
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,300
This is 80 something more like that and maybe we'll try to do it a

359
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,600
little closer to will do 2 to 5 to 10 to 20 to 40 and we'll see how

360
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,300
that goes.

361
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
And so if we were going to do that let's start over just on the back

362
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,400
there.

363
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,300
That seems like it's moving a reasonable amount for a distant plane.

364
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
So let's just assume that that's going to be good enough for now.

365
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,200
And I'm going to shrink that down.

366
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,600
Right.

367
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,800
I don't know how far down that should be.

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,600
She probably also stopped.

369
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,200
The motion.

370
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,600
Okay.

371
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
How big is it really is?

372
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
Is it roughly 40?

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Yes, it's roughly 40.

374
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,000
And then 10.

375
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,800
There we go.

376
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,000
All right.

377
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,400
So let's put the next one in.

378
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,900
And that's going to be.

379
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Much smaller.

380
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,500
It was certainly 25 before, so it looks like it's about 24.

381
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,100
Okay, and that I don't know how high that is 52.

382
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,400
Three.

383
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
So that's about 3.5.

384
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,800
All right.

385
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,700
And so how does that look, the zoom?

386
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
So that's looking better.

387
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Zoom lies to me, right?

388
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,500
That's definitely giving that's that's got a little bit more of that

389
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,600
motion now, the background.

390
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,200
So you can start a start to see the the depth of the theme coming

391
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,100
through a little bit more, so I think that's good.

392
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,600
Okay, so let's add another layer in there.

393
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
Okay, so the other layer is now that's 20.

394
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,000
So this was going to be at 10 right thought I just yeah, I turn that

395
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,300
off.

396
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,500
So let's start that guy, back in the center and I don't know how big

397
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,000
you can probably be, maybe something like that.

398
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,700
That's probably too big, maybe the more like that.

399
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,600
Kind of a thing probably possibly maybe.

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,900
Don't know, can't tell.

401
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,400
So that's going to be like 1.5 and it's going to be like .5 /.

402
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,900
Probably be a little more.

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,200
475.

404
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
And so that's up against the corner now.

405
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,500
And so let's take a look at how that moves when it moves.

406
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,100
So, that's looking good.

407
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,300
Now, you can really kind of see those layers starting to separate,

408
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,800
which is what I want.

409
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,000
So, that's kind of good.

410
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,200
And now, let's get that last layer in there before the, for the little

411
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,700
kid.

412
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,000
Oops.

413
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,700
So, there is layer 5 in the foreground, and layer 5 is offset already.

414
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,100
So let me turn that off and get this scale down to something

415
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,800
reasonable.

416
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,900
There we go.

417
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,300
So it's kind of on the left, right?

418
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,800
So let's go ahead and make that be like a little bigger maybe than it

419
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
was and let's move it up a bit.

420
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Wait.

421
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
This is not the last layer.

422
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,900
This is the second to last layer.

423
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,300
My bad.

424
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,300
I misspoke.

425
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
And I said this was the last layer.

426
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,200
That was just plain, erupt.

427
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,100
That was erroneous, it was an erroneous statement.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,500
All right.

429
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Perfect, perfect.

430
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,600
Okay, so that's good.

431
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,100
And now last last the actual last layer, before the kid instead of the

432
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,700
fake Last layer where it wasn't really the last layer.

433
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,800
But I said that it was because I was just plain wrong.

434
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,700
So there we go.

435
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
So that's the actual last layer.

436
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
And so now we just need to make sure that sized properly, which I

437
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
think is probably something like this.

438
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,500
Yeah, and then we got to move it up slightly.

439
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,200
Now of course we have a problem which is that I guess we can't really

440
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,000
move it up slightly.

441
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,100
So actually just has to be straight up, scaled more, looks like it's

442
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,200
not really the right size which is unfortunate but as far as I can

443
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,900
tell like that's just yeah that's just not going to that's not going

444
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,400
to work.

445
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,000
It would have to it has to be a little bit higher, a little bit

446
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,400
bigger.

447
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,200
Yeah.

448
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,200
After we check to make sure you can export something wrong there and

449
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,100
let's move it up.

450
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,500
So just a tease.

451
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:22,900
Yeah.

452
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Just a smidge.

453
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

454
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,300
Alright, so that's about it.

455
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,600
Now, we just need to put the little kid in there, right?

456
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,500
And the kid is just going to be, I guess, maybe it like - 14.

457
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,500
You know, -.5 something like that?

458
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,200
Pretty close up.

459
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,100
I think you would want them to be

460
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,500
Do wrong.

461
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,400
So, it's probably not that big.

462
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
All right, so maybe .5 was correct.

463
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,700
Maybe a little bit bigger than that.

464
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
And then he just needs to be moved over to sort of, you know, the

465
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,700
shot.

466
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
You can clearly see the shots framed with him, kind of looking to, you

467
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,900
know, from the left to the right.

468
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,200
So we probably want to obey that line-of-sight.

469
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Certainly

470
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
So, let's see.

471
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,400
There he is and maybe just even just a hair more.

472
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,900
All right, so let's see, let's see what happens if we let this animate

473
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,300
now.

474
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
So that looks pretty good.

475
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,200
Although word clearly not moving towards the center of interest there.

476
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,900
So I'm going to go ahead and move the camera over so that it spanning

477
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,900
towards the center of Interest more directly like.

478
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,800
So see how that goes.

479
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,200
Probably a little too much of a lift there.

480
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,900
So we'll keep that down a little bit more.

481
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Probably also want to knock that down a little bit that feels about

482
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,700
right.

483
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,700
Maybe a bit less.

484
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,800
So I think that's roughly what we would want the pan to be the kid.

485
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Maybe comes out of the picture a little too quick.

486
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,300
So let's go ahead and put him at one instead.

487
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,800
We got some separation of those layers.

488
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,100
Unfortunately to their cement to scale, one of them up.

489
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
Yeah, so that looks pretty good.

490
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,700
It's just that that that mid-layer this one right here.

491
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
Looks like it needs to be scaled up a bit.

492
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,800
Unfortunate.

493
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Because you can see it starts to separate right there at that, that

494
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,200
bottom piece.

495
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,200
Oh, so I can't move it up a bit, right?

496
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,400
I have to put it down a bit, oops, that's 11.

497
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,400
Got to leave it down.

498
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
But then, it's will separate that one.

499
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,200
Yeah, this is why I always ask for aprons on stuff, but it's tough.

500
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,800
If you're not, if you're not, someone who's used to making Parallax

501
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,300
shots, it can be kind of tough to remember how they're going to

502
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,900
actually work in practice.

503
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,500
So, you know, that's kind of, it's just a thing that happens.

504
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,700
But I can just knock some of these guys down a little bit and then

505
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,400
we'll probably be.

506
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,900
Okay.

507
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,900
I can't see because my my

508
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,500
fortunately, my

509
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,000
Head is in the way I need to see kind of that corner.

510
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,800
So you see that the corner there is got a problem.

511
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
So I need to be able to see that as well.

512
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,400
So I'm going to go ahead and and do this.

513
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,500
Well, I tune these so I can see that corner opening up and fix it.

514
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,100
So I'm going to move that back layer down.

515
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,100
I got to make that back layer a little bit bigger.

516
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,200
So that's that's this one, right?

517
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,300
Yeah.

518
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,800
So I'm gonna have to make that probably a little bit bigger than it is

519
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
just to cover again.

520
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,500
That that range.

521
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,900
And I'm going to go ahead and slide it over a bit too.

522
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,300
Let's see.

523
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,300
Okay, so now let's see how that goes.

524
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,400
Seems okay.

525
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Seems okay.

526
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,400
Yeah, it's still a little bit there.

527
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,500
Darn it.

528
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,700
All right.

529
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Duh, so just a teeny little bit there.

530
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,900
So now there won't be any bit there, but I don't know about the start,

531
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
whether there's any fringing on the start.

532
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I think that's about it, but hopefully, they're, you know, we're going

533
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,900
to have to check.

534
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Okay, so that's fine.

535
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,400
All right, so let's see if I can see any other problems at the moment.

536
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
So the kid needs to be the kid at the start is a little bit off, so

537
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,700
we'll fix him in a second.

538
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,700
Is there any gapping on this guy?

539
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
Yes, there's a little gap down back guy.

540
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,000
So he needs to be moved down just a little bit as well.

541
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,300
Is it this one?

542
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,600
All right, so

543
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,300
I don't see any Gap problems with this one, really.

544
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,400
So I think we're really just talking about moving the kid down and

545
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
moving that other layer down just a hair.

546
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
So, it's not that one.

547
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,400
It's this one.

548
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,100
The kid has to be moved down slightly.

549
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,400
There it goes.

550
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,200
And now let's go back to

551
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,100
the motion.

552
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,700
and see if there's any other bugs that we

553
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Fix.

554
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Good, pretty good so far.

555
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,800
That one's still needs to be down, just a little bit, just a hair.

556
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,300
So this guy right here, probably needs to be more like that.

557
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,500
I'm reasonably happy with that.

558
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Yep, all good.

559
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,800
There's a little bit of that back one.

560
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,200
I feel like there's just a bit of this guy.

561
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,500
So I feel like he needs to be maybe move down just a hair.

562
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
See if that would do it.

563
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,900
Now, I need to be down a little more than that.

564
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,900
And so, I don't know if that up clip him off the top at all.

565
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,300
I think that's about it.

566
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,500
That's looking good though.

567
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,900
That's looking pretty good.

568
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,400
Any clipping problems.

569
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,900
Nope.

570
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
So that looks okay.

571
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,300
All right, I'm reasonably happy with that.

572
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay, so there's our set of cutscenes.

573
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,800
I think I can I can say that that's a pretty reasonable first attempt

574
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,100
at getting all of our cutscenes lined up, so there they are.

575
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,200
As you can see, it takes a little while to tune them.

576
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,700
Again, if you really had to do ton of these, you're going to do like a

577
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,600
hundred cutscenes or something.

578
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You'd want to make a little tool for tweaking the values or something.

579
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
You know, you could write an importer for some tool or something.

580
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,500
But as a whole, I'm pretty happy with how that goes and so now but we

581
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,000
need to do, right?

582
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,200
Because we've

583
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,100
Make some way of playing these in a series, so that each cutscene

584
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
plays, you know, back to back.

585
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,400
So you can kind of see the whole thing, right?

586
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
You can see the whole thing happen.

587
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,800
And in order to do that, what I would like to do is say, Okay, since

588
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,400
this is clearly very data-driven at this point, right?

589
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,000
You can kind of see the data just living right there.

590
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:21,300
I should be able to just wrap those up into into, you know,

591
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,700
no, an array of layered scenes and just run it that way, right?

592
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,200
So I should be able to do something like, you know, layered scene.

593
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,200
You know, intro cutscene like that, right?

594
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,800
And then just literally grabbed everything here and dump it in there.

595
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,700
You know, and so now we can just go ahead and convert these into just

596
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,400
just literally, just some data.

597
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,700
So we know that we've got, you know, that kind of thing or there's the

598
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,600
asset type

599
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,600
There's the shot index.

600
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,800
There's the layer count.

601
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,900
Here's the layers.

602
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,200
In fact, what I could do as well, is just something like this.

603
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,000
Where I say the layer count is like the array count.

604
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,500
Layers one or intro layers.

605
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,700
One, something like that.

606
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,400
And then intro there is one so I could do something like that.

607
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,400
There we go.

608
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,600
Right?

609
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,900
And that would just let me do like, okay, here's intro layers one.

610
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,700
However, many it has in it.

611
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,400
That's how many we do, right?

612
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,200
And so, that'd be pretty straightforward.

613
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,600
I could even do something, you know, I could do something even a

614
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,400
little bit more ridiculous.

615
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,600
This could, this isn't a turtle Global by the way, right?

616
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,500
Or Global variable rather,

617
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,000
I could even do something a little bit weirder.

618
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,699
We're actually making macro like intro, like intro scene and then a

619
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:14,300
number.

620
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,300
Right?

621
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,699
And that would just be this stuff.

622
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,199
It would just be like that.

623
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,600
If that makes any sense, I don't know if that's a good idea, it might

624
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,800
be a stupid idea, but we certainly could do it because the index

625
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
appears like multiple times there, right?

626
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,900
So we could do interesting index like that, and

627
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,699
And do this.

628
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,000
I don't know, like I said, don't know if that's a good idea but we

629
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,400
could do it under way.

630
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,100
What Undeclared identifier it gets passed in.

631
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,300
Oh duh.

632
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,500
Okay so we could do something like that where we just kind of data

633
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
drive it a little bit more straightforwardly.

634
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,700
And that way we can kind of just

635
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,700
Drop these out here.

636
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,500
This is this is kind of convenient actually.

637
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,500
Now that I'm looking at it, that seems kind of nice, right?

638
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,100
Yeah.

639
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,800
Yeah, I like that.

640
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,100
So I'm going to go ahead and just do the munging to put all these in

641
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,300
that format and that should be that should be about it.

642
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,500
So this is actually intro shot, I suppose.

643
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,400
All right and just shot a shot.

644
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,100
And that compresses down pretty nice.

645
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,800
So I'm going to go ahead and grab out all the layers like so,

646
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,100
And that should be just about all there is to it.

647
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,100
There we go.

648
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,800
And several of these to do here.

649
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
There we go.

650
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Control errors.

651
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,600
Five.

652
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,700
And this is where I should probably use more than one window and

653
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,800
ping-pong back and forth.

654
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,400
But, you know,

655
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Coulda Shoulda Woulda.

656
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,400
There we go.

657
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,700
I could also done a crazy Macro for this.

658
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,000
You know how I do like me and you know, some emacs macro action now it

659
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,400
again.

660
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,400
Let's see, so yeah, looks good fact, I could do this.

661
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
If I wasn't dumb I just do it this way with my

662
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,300
There we go.

663
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,800
So now, I've gotten all of those layers out, and I'm put them up here

664
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:00,700
as existing arrays, and then I should be able to just kind of change

665
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,800
these quickly into format.

666
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,900
We're using in the magnet

667
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,600
All right, so that seems good and that's all of our stuff there.

668
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,900
So now these guys are really pretty trivial.

669
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,900
This is just going to be like a sort of gathering up the camera, pan

670
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,400
information and putting it into into place, right?

671
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,400
So we're basically just going to grab those and put them in here.

672
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,300
3 4, 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and so all I need now is just like these guys,

673
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,400
right?

674
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,400
And the fact that I feel like I am kind of tired typing at this point.

675
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
So I do kind of feel like maybe now.

676
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,600
Oops would be a good time to bust that one of those ridiculous macros.

677
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
So let's just try it.

678
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,200
Let's just try it and see what happens.

679
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,300
Because it's going to be crazy and weird so let's do it.

680
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,200
So here's what I'm going to do.

681
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,100
This macro in Ridiculousness and this is a macro purely purely for my

682
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,200
own Amusement.

683
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,100
I'm just going to go ahead and set up this guy here and this guy here.

684
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,600
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to record the macro starting in

685
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,100
this window.

686
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm going to switch to the other window.

687
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm going to search for camera start.

688
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
I'm going to cut

689
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,600
Out the actual value Switchback paste it.

690
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Hit the comma switch again search for camera and right again, cut out

691
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,700
the value Switchback paste, right?

692
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,200
And then I'm going to search for the location of the next one.

693
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
And end the macro.

694
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,200
And so there will just suck them out, one at a time and done.

695
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,800
Ridiculous, I know.

696
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
Like I said, kind of absurd.

697
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,100
And so now the only thing that I think is left is the shot change time

698
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,600
thing.

699
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And so the shot change time was always 0.5 at the moment.

700
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,600
So what I should be able to do here because I should be able to go

701
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,500
into the people who were using the shot change time and for now I

702
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,100
should be able to put it to just point five so and we can always.

703
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,700
Oops we can always fuss with that.

704
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
A little later on.

705
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,800
If we want.

706
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,400
All right, so that's all good.

707
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,600
Now, we've got all of our stuff wrapped up in there and we now have to

708
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,900
render our scene.

709
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,800
Somehow we should be able to just if we just want to test it right.

710
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
We should be able to say you know intro cutscene and pick one of them

711
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:52,800
right.

712
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,100
Whatever it is and we should now be able to just like cycle through

713
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,100
our cutscenes really easily.

714
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,200
You know what I mean?

715
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,700
So that's, that's pretty good.

716
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,000
And so we need to now figure out

717
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,900
Some way of dealing with this.

718
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,300
We now need to figure out some way that we can play all of these in a

719
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,800
sequence, right?

720
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,800
And so we want to introduce first of all I assume is for any one of

721
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,400
these shots we're going to want to have a another parameter which

722
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,100
allows us to say how long it's going to last.

723
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,300
But we talked about this yesterday

724
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,600
because not every shot you know will be necessarily on the screen for

725
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,500
the same amount of time.

726
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,000
So before we talk about like the camera start and end, maybe what

727
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,500
we'll talk about is the duration of the shot.

728
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,900
And so if I talk about the duration of the shot,

729
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,000
Then for each one of these guys here, right before it, we would put

730
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,700
the duration is.

731
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,400
And so, you know, we had a duration of 20 for each of these shots.

732
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,200
So I'll go ahead and just put that in here.

733
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,700
Like so, so that's all good.

734
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,800
And then you can see when we're doing this map to range thing here,

735
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,600
that map to range was that was taking the input value for the cutscene

736
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,800
and mapping it into R 0 to 1.

737
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,600
Now, unfortunately, it's only going to range from 0 to 20 because we

738
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,400
like hard-coded that in the art and the outside code and we don't

739
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,400
really want that to be the case, probably.

740
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,500
So I think what we'd rather do here is we'd rather just do something,

741
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,300
you know, maybe I'll even do something like this where we just pass in

742
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,000
the tea cutscene for now.

743
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
So we don't have to think about it.

744
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,900
And so when this thing calls out,

745
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,700
And passes that cutscene information will, just go ahead and pass the

746
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,200
address.

747
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,700
So that way, it can wrap it if it needs to or do whatever else it

748
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,000
wants to do, right.

749
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,700
so what I'll do here is I'll say, okay, let's start by looking at

750
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
This input value.

751
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,500
And we know we're going to have a fairly low number of cutscenes,

752
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,000
right?

753
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,700
Shots in the cutscene, it's only 11:00 in this one.

754
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,100
And if we do like a, I haven't decided whether there's like a game,

755
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,000
like a conclusion cutscene or something.

756
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,600
But, you know, if there's a conclusion cutscene, it's probably going

757
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
to be even less than that.

758
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,400
Like the intro is probably the one that has the most in it, right?

759
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,400
And so we know that there's just going to be very few, so I can just

760
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,300
linearly search to see where this value Falls, right?

761
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
So I'm gonna get a t-value

762
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
And I have a series of durations, right?

763
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,200
And so I can initialize T, start and T or rather TTC base.

764
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,500
Let's say right?

765
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,600
I guess I tease base to say the first, whatever.

766
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,300
The first shot is it's going to start at zero, right?

767
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,800
And then I can just Loop through here and I can say well for whatever

768
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,000
shot index, I'm on

769
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,000
Looping through the shots is just going to be however, many there are

770
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,500
in that intro cutscene array, right?

771
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,400
And for each one of those, right?

772
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,500
I can grab out, whatever the scene is for that particular shot by just

773
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,900
saying, whatever the intro cutscenes are.

774
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm going to grab out whatever shot index that is so on that

775
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,800
particular scene, I now have a duration variable, right?

776
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,100
We added this concept of adoration so the durations there,

777
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,600
So what I know is the start of this scene is going to be equal to T

778
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,200
base.

779
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,800
The duration of the scene is going is specified, so the end is just a

780
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,900
start plus that.

781
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,200
And then so then the t-base afterwards, like the next one would just

782
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,300
be equal to.

783
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
Well it would just be equal to the end, right?

784
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,700
The start of the next scene is the end of this scene.

785
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:50,800
So what I can do there is say, okay, if you know if T cutscene is

786
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,400
greater than or equal to the start,

787
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,000
And see, cutscene is less than the end.

788
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,700
I've got an idea or two, but we'll talk about that later, and it's

789
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,600
less than the end.

790
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,800
Then, I know that we are in this particular shot.

791
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,800
So this is the shot that we're talking about.

792
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,100
So it's the one that I want to render, right?

793
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,200
And after I render it, I can also end if I'd like to because I know

794
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,000
that we're only going to render one scene.

795
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,500
If we had multiple overlapping scenes, we could not do that, but we

796
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,200
don't, so that's fine.

797
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,300
And so then what I want to do is map the map T normal into that range.

798
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,900
So I'm just going to go ahead and say OK, map it but

799
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,600
Tween.

800
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,700
I should make these T.

801
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,100
Start map that between t star and T end and and that's what I'll do.

802
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,200
The other thing I can do is make sure that if we flow off the

803
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,600
beginning or the off the end, I could also make it so we're under

804
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,200
saying, but we don't really need to think about that quite yet we're

805
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
probably fine without worrying about that too much.

806
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,800
Okay.

807
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,800
And so then what I'd like to do is say all right at the end of this if

808
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,900
T cutscene is greater than or equal

809
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,100
Equal to T base.

810
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,400
That means we've gone past the end and so I'll just set the cutscene

811
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,200
back to zero for now.

812
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,200
But probably what we'd want to do is signal to the outside.

813
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,100
At that point that hey man, there's nothing there's no more cutscenes

814
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,600
or render the actual game like stop playing the cutscene right?

815
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,200
And that seems pretty straightforward.

816
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,900
So, there we go, that's the code.

817
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,900
And I think now we probably in theory, anyway, should be able to get

818
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,700
this whole thing going.

819
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,700
So let's see.

820
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,900
So that's how that works.

821
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,600
Do you know, we'll pack up direct clamp to range should just work

822
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,400
although I don't see anything which suggests to me, that it doesn't

823
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,000
work, right?

824
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I mean, I should be seeing somebody moving or somebody doing something

825
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,500
but I see.

826
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,200
Absolutely nothing.

827
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,900
So we, yeah.

828
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,200
What's wrong with this picture?

829
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,100
Intro cutscene was taught.

830
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,900
See, I should step into the debugger, I suppose T.

831
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Star T equals T base Tian is to start plus seen duration, which is 20.

832
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,500
So it's going to be whatever that is, if the cutscene is greater than

833
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,300
equal to that start value and less than the end value.

834
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,400
Then we map it in between the two to forty normal, which we pass.

835
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,300
Oh, that's not so good.

836
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,900
That should be shot index, obviously, but that doesn't explain where

837
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,500
RT normal value is not changing.

838
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,100
Artie.

839
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:29,800
Normal value for clamp map to range between to start T end is is

840
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,400
janky, right?

841
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,600
Does not seem to be correct.

842
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,000
All right, so I'm going to step into that and just see what's wrong.

843
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,000
Probably do something stupid.

844
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,300
I'm a little bit tired today.

845
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,900
I'll admit it.

846
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,700
So, yeah.

847
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,700
Normally that's not code that she should have any bugs in when you

848
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,300
write it.

849
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
It's not particularly complicated.

850
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,000
But yeah, so here is our scene and there's a there's all the

851
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,200
information for the scene.

852
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,000
It's shot index 0 right for the first one.

853
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,400
And so let's see what the to start.

854
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,200
T end is and what is our key cutscene

855
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:11,800
Oops.

856
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,300
There we go.

857
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,800
So that definitely is in between 0 and 20, no question about that but

858
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
coming here, but Artie, normal should not be 0, right?

859
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,100
Because we're mapping between 0 and 20 and T cutscene is not quite

860
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,400
that.

861
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,300
So let's take a look at what that actually is.

862
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,200
We map it.

863
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,300
That's good.

864
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,800
So off we go, we break out of that and

865
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,500
Ah, that's the problem.

866
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,200
Yeah, that's kind of stupid.

867
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,600
If we break out, we'll never know what the end actually is.

868
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,300
So that was a dumb way to do that.

869
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

870
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,100
Pretty stupid.

871
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,900
That was pretty stupid.

872
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,900
So we might do want to do something more like this, where we do, you

873
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,300
know,

874
00:47:59,500 --> 00:47:59,800
That's all.

875
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,200
and if you're not pretty stupid, then you reset the cutscene

876
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,400
That's a little better.

877
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,900
And so now we should actually see more of our cutscene happening and

878
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,300
and yeah, we should when we're finished our zoom on the home for

879
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:26,900
limbless children, we should then be in a yeah, in better shape for we

880
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,800
should we should see, you know, the the little kid at the window,

881
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,700
there he is.

882
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,200
And then after the little kid at the window, we should see, you know,

883
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,500
the looking

884
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,500
Very shoulder at the toys, right?

885
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,700
Which we still like this is kind of our most problematic scene doesn't

886
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,500
look that good.

887
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,100
So we may have to kind of work on that one.

888
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,900
Maybe change the art of it, I don't know.

889
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:56,000
And then we have Santa Claus of being his usual useless self and

890
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,600
giving the kid get another hat for Christmas you know what can you do

891
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,600
then we've got Krampus of course, bursting through the door and there

892
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,000
is an all his majesty.

893
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,300
It comes to find little Timmy, take a little Timmy away, there's a

894
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,100
little Timmy in The foreground running, you know, trying to get out

895
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,800
certainly as fast as you can.

896
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Can't escape Krampus, but thankfully for Timmy and Timmy doesn't know

897
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,400
how lucky he is.

898
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,500
But thanks to her Timmy, the little hero stops Krampus.

899
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,400
Right.

900
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,600
And he's like dude, you are not going to do that to Timmy and then

901
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,700
Krampus is so impressed by the bravado that he's like hey man, you

902
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:38,500
know I

903
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,700
I'm going to give you your own hand fine.

904
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,200
I'm going to give you a hand, you can use.

905
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,200
And so the kid is like, so psyched about this, obviously,

906
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:49,400
Goes back to his room and he's like, I'm going to pick up one of these

907
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,000
hats.

908
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,500
That's an has always been giving me that I can never use and I can

909
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,000
like put it on now and I can go on an adventure which is what I've

910
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,500
always wanted to do if I'd only had a hand.

911
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:06,900
And now I have one and so he grabs you know hat and goes off now of

912
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,400
course you are allowed to pick the hat so we don't know which hat it's

913
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,300
going to be exactly but you know you get the idea.

914
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,100
All right, so that's in pretty good shape, I think.

915
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,500
And, and now we're playing all the cutscenes together and we can

916
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,800
change the duration of the cutscenes so that pretty much makes it so

917
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,900
that we're all set, I think.

918
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:30,200
You know for a first pass we're going to obviously want to tune that

919
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,800
stuff and when we get some voice acting in their, we're going to want

920
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,700
to again adjust the timing.

921
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,600
But for the most part, we've succeeded in what we wanted to do which

922
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,900
was just have all of our cut scenes, stuff, a good first pass of all

923
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,900
of our cut scenes working pretty straightforward,

924
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
word, since we wrote a renderer,

925
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,900
we are done all the heavy lifting.

926
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,000
It was really pretty easy for us to do and hey look at that.

927
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,400
We're just in time for the Q&A.

928
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,900
So let's go ahead.

929
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,900
and go to said q, a

930
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,100
Let's see.

931
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,800
What is in Q&A?

932
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,800
Let's see.

933
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,300
Yvonne, will there be hat DLC?

934
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,000
No, probably not.

935
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,700
I'm going to Cranberry wait for more questions.

936
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,300
I will do you prefer opengl or DirectX?

937
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:57,100
I prefer opengl because you can sort of Leverage that on multiple

938
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,700
platforms.

939
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,800
Like you can run on Linux and Mac instead of DirectX only allows you

940
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,400
to run on Windows which is kind of annoying.

941
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,500
Who draws the pictures, you anxiously draws the pictures, all that the

942
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,000
hmh bot, take care of that one.

943
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,000
I think there is still a tiny Gap at the bottom at the top of the

944
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,900
window and shot to towards the very end of the shot.

945
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,700
That may be true shot too.

946
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,700
Whoops, that that's shot index.

947
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,100
Is actually one.

948
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,800
She probably pad that out.

949
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,100
She'd probably do this, just so we don't get super confused, right?

950
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,400
Because otherwise it'll total be like what's going on.

951
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,500
All right, try again.

952
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,500
Yeah, you're right.

953
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,500
Wait.

954
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,600
Yeah.

955
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,300
All right, so that means in shot too.

956
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,100
The hero entry have to be a little bigger than they are, right?

957
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,400
So now I think we're good.

958
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,400
Seems like the cutscene is nearly finished for a first pass.

959
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Are we returning to debugging next?

960
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,000
Yes, probably, I don't know.

961
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,300
We'll see what happens.

962
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,300
I'm not sure who knows, whatever we decide to do next, will do next.

963
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,300
Yuffie is how do you compile so fast?

964
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Just don't use a bunch of libraries and templates, and crappy things

965
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,600
and you compile quite fast actually.

966
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,700
So I suppose the kid will there be sound effects in the intro scene,

967
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,600
IE door opening sound effects with this be separate or part of the

968
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,200
voiceover.

969
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,300
Yeah.

970
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,200
If there's any side effects, they'll probably be baked in like

971
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,500
normally in the game will be playing sound effects based on, like

972
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,500
what's happening but in the in the intro would probably just be all

973
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,800
part of the intro audio.

974
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,400
The last trip time starting out game development.

975
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,500
Know a good portion of C++ but trying to learn opengl or Advanced

976
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,900
Graphics rendering libs are feeling too tedious to me any

977
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,200
recommendations.

978
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,800
Not, not really tedious.

979
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:07,400
If learning opengl sounds tedious, that's probably not a good sign,

980
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,900
opengl slick, pretty easy compared to like if you had to write it

981
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,900
yourself, for example, you know, so I'm not sure.

982
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,200
Maybe you mean something other than tedious, you just mean difficult.

983
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,500
If it's difficult than yeah.

984
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,300
I mean part of it is opengl.

985
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,600
There is not a lot of good documentation on it anymore because it's

986
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,900
changed so much the old like tutorials and stuff just aren't really

987
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,700
that relevant compared to what you know.

988
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,500
And so there's very few like really good tutorial to point people to

989
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,800
if they want to use like opengl for, you know.

990
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,400
And so yeah, it's, it's a bit of a problem.

991
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,300
And unfortunately, there's not much I can recommend there.

992
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,700
Well, the hat be in the cutscene after its chosen.

993
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,100
Yeah I think so.

994
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,400
I mean I think what we try to do is just pick that layer dynamically

995
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,300
based on which hat you picked, but if we can't do that then we could

996
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,000
just you know, we could just cheese it.

997
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,600
We may just have to like put a random hat on him because now I think

998
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,200
about it.

999
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,200
That's if that plays in like attract mode you know then you wouldn't

1000
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,300
have picked a hat yet.

1001
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,700
So that my yeah, I don't know.

1002
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:21,400
If you can't excited for Vulcan no I am not excited for Vulcan.

1003
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,500
I don't like the design of Vulcan.

1004
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,100
I don't agree with it may blow.

1005
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,200
Could we just watch the cutscene on Loop while we do Q&A sure?

1006
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,000
Let's go ahead and do that.

1007
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,000
Know, any good opengl tutorials are the arc synthesis ones, which you

1008
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,800
mentioned before and like, on stream way back when and which are, I

1009
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,800
believe link to on the forums somewhere.

1010
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,600
Those are the only ones that are any good.

1011
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,400
They got taken down but somebody like saved, a PDF of them or

1012
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:05,800
something.

1013
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,300
I don't know.

1014
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Those were okay.

1015
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:08,800
But yeah.

1016
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,300
It's there just aren't that.

1017
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,600
Many is what guy saying that?

1018
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,100
There's, there's someone should probably write some good opengl

1019
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,400
tutorials at some point.

1020
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,600
For that over-the-shoulder seen what if you could give the boy a

1021
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,600
velocity as well?

1022
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,200
So that it partially exaggerated or counter the camera movement,

1023
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,500
giving him some actual Movement.

1024
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,900
We could we could also slow his movement down.

1025
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,600
I don't know like like I haven't thought about it too much.

1026
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,400
I got to think about what the right thing to do is there.

1027
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,300
I don't really know.

1028
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,700
What do you have to say to the anti Global variable zealots?

1029
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,900
Who would complain about, all those Global's in the cutscene code?

1030
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:16,000
I would tell them that it's if that's data, first of all.

1031
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,900
So if they think of that as a global variable, then they have to think

1032
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:24,200
of all of the data that's loaded out of like file out of data, files

1033
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,300
is also

1034
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:26,900
Bad.

1035
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,300
In which case I would ask them how they plan on building a game with

1036
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:29,900
no data.

1037
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,700
I think the last shot still has clipping at the end, the heroes head.

1038
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:39,800
Yeah.

1039
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,900
I think we clip through the near clipping plane.

1040
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:47,200
I don't know why the near clipping plane is set where it is because it

1041
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,800
doesn't seem like it would have to.

1042
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,700
But yeah, it does disappear a little too early.

1043
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,300
Why, what is the setting for the near clipping plane?

1044
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,500
Is there a reason for that?

1045
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,600
Do we know?

1046
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,700
I don't really know.

1047
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,300
I'm very curious to know if we set the near clipping plane to anything

1048
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,800
for any particular reason.

1049
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,200
I suppose we could go back and watch the bod.

1050
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,800
What's your favorite header file to include?

1051
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,000
The ones you will advance for your project.

1052
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,900
I don't pound include anything that I didn't write.

1053
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,100
So, I think the answer would be somewhat meaningless.

1054
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
if I were to actually answer it,

1055
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:09,600
My project, our main game does not use any lb includes that are

1056
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,100
external.

1057
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,000
At all, literally zero.

1058
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,400
Let's see.

1059
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
When do you mention the banding on the streamer lives and said it

1060
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,600
would be really easy to fix.

1061
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
How would you fix it?

1062
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,900
So yeah.

1063
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,600
Basically like this is just this, this extremely lame.

1064
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,600
The thing that does that is just this little app.

1065
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,600
I wrote a long time ago for a totally different purpose, so it doesn't

1066
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,400
really do anything.

1067
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,400
Correct graphically.

1068
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,000
And so it, the the gradient is very banded.

1069
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,600
You can't really see it on in this case because there's so much color

1070
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,400
information underneath it.

1071
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,300
But if you put it against just like a regular flat background, you can

1072
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,500
see that there's banding

1073
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,900
And so to fix that, it's really simple.

1074
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,200
All you have to do is just get through it.

1075
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,400
That's it and so you can get through it any real way that you want.

1076
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,300
You know, if you're going to be super hardcore, you'd use blue noise

1077
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,700
but you know you don't really have to be that hard core.

1078
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,300
You could just use anything just a standard ordered even just a really

1079
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,900
basic death or would be fine.

1080
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,800
Who is your ideal voice of Krampus?

1081
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:30,600
I don't think Krampus is going to have any speaking Parts in this.

1082
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,900
Growing Doubloon.

1083
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:35,900
Do the hats, mr.

1084
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,600
Magical powers upon you.

1085
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,300
They might

1086
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,600
I asked this during the priest reading, but sure, but not sure your

1087
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,600
credit still catching the series but have you written it better hash

1088
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,000
after the same region episodes.

1089
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,600
No, there's been no, there's no touching of the hash.

1090
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,800
And remember, we have to shift this this game with at least one.

1091
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,900
Comment / / to do better hash function so that might be the one but

1092
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:02,000
you never know as long as there's one.

1093
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,400
Captain craft off-topic, how much planning for a large longer than one

1094
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:11,500
year?

1095
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,700
Software project.

1096
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,800
Do you do before us to start the project?

1097
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,900
How do you estimate the time?

1098
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,500
It takes to get the work done.

1099
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,200
Yeah I don't really know that that's an answer.

1100
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,700
You can give without knowing more about the project, right?

1101
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,300
And usually the it's also worth knowing that it's very difficult to

1102
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,600
predict those sorts of things.

1103
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,900
If the product is interesting at all, because chances are

1104
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,800
Going to be, if there's any research involved or anything

1105
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,300
unpredictable.

1106
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:46,800
There, then really, it's you have to you rather than a schedule or a

1107
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,000
plant which are usually making is sort of like a series of decision

1108
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,300
points where you look a right to try this and see what happens in the

1109
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:52,600
based on.

1110
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,900
That will do one of two things and that sort of stuff.

1111
01:02:59,600 --> 01:02:59,800
When?

1112
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,700
Up and coming out?

1113
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,800
Why do you not like Vulcan?

1114
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,100
I don't know when Vulcan is coming out and I don't like it because I

1115
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,400
didn't like the design of it.

1116
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,700
Curling champ.

1117
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,500
Are you familiar with free, glut?

1118
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,100
Thoughts on that?

1119
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,600
Specifically, I have never seen free.

1120
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,900
Glad I do not know what it is.

1121
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,000
See.

1122
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,400
I'm trying to go as independent as I can.

1123
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,500
And my code base is, well, one thing that I'm not sure how to replace

1124
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,900
this glue, how to load the opengl functions, myself mention of your

1125
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,400
library for that.

1126
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:29,700
Any tips?

1127
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,900
Advice on the right where to begin?

1128
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,400
You can just use wiggle, get proc address wgl.

1129
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,000
Get proc address will allow you to load any opengl function.

1130
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,700
So, so, you know, once you once you load library and get a, the

1131
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,600
address of will get proc address, which I believe is in gdr 32 lib.

1132
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,300
So dull it GTA 3, 2.2 L.

1133
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,200
So once you dynamically load GDI, which doesn't actually have to die

1134
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:56,600
in fluid.

1135
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,500
You jack is already mapped in.

1136
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,700
But once you get the coroner GTI using load library, then you go ahead

1137
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,400
and get wiggle proc address and use local property.

1138
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,500
Just get the rest of the opengl addresses.

1139
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,300
What did Krampus do with the other children after he gifted that hand

1140
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,100
to our hero.

1141
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,800
What was the purpose of his visit?

1142
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
Well you have to wait for the voice acting.

1143
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,900
I think maybe to find out some of those specifics.

1144
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,600
Huber, Caleb do you least include Windows?

1145
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,000
No, I do not include windows.

1146
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,200
I'm in my purse hover, there's a glitch in the graphic near the

1147
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,200
Cockroaches antenna in the hats put on the hats playing.

1148
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,300
Actually there's a lot of glitches.

1149
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,400
Unfortunately, I don't know how many of these we want to clean up.

1150
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,100
Like it depends how much stuff I want to send back to Yankton for

1151
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,100
like, clean up stuff.

1152
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:51,500
There's a lot of places where the alpha isn't fully one as well so you

1153
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,100
can see like Krampus is hand.

1154
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,800
Like even in that shot kind of shows through a little bit so there's a

1155
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,300
bunch of stuff for clean up there and I don't know how you know

1156
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:02,100
picking we want to get about that stuff.

1157
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,700
I want to be very picky about the programming by, don't know that this

1158
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,000
is a game where we want to be super picky about the art.

1159
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,800
This is not really a product that's about art Direction.

1160
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,400
It's a project.

1161
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:12,600
That's a

1162
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,500
Programming.

1163
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,500
So I don't know what I want to do about that or not, but there's a

1164
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,700
bunch of those this quite a few of them.

1165
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,400
I have a feeling the clip plane might have been introduced when we

1166
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,900
were doing the multiple ground layers.

1167
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,200
Yeah, and it was definitely introduce.

1168
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,600
I just don't know why it was set to what it was set at probably just

1169
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,800
random my guess it may not have been a reason for it at all.

1170
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,800
if I may be under a 10-7, feedings you layers, okay,

1171
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:23,700
So, yeah, maybe we'll check.

1172
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,100
I don't know.

1173
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,300
We probably just picked it.

1174
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,800
Randomly would be my guess because we just need a near clipping plane

1175
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,500
because we can't not have one or we might draw something at zero,

1176
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,800
which would cause a divide by zero or something, right?

1177
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,200
K.

1178
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,100
Krampus sounds.

1179
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:53,600
So cool.

1180
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,900
How did you come up with the name?

1181
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,700
I didn't Krampus.

1182
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:59,600
Is a real Krampus has a real thing.

1183
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,700
You can look him up.

1184
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,000
He like this is actually based on a true story, right?

1185
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,200
True story.

1186
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,600
Real Krampus, you know, real Santa Claus real Krampus.

1187
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,600
And you know, I mean was there really an orphanage for a limbless

1188
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,400
children?

1189
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,700
I mean, you know,

1190
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,200
But obviously, Krampus and Santa Claus are real.

1191
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,700
So,

1192
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:32,600
You know that that part is not is not open to question at all

1193
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,200
certainly.

1194
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,600
That's just science fact.

1195
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,900
Does Krampus Return to Zero?

1196
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I don't know what that means.

1197
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,400
Return To Zero what

1198
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,700
So no more real questions of looks like I think we're done with

1199
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,200
questions for the day, maybe.

1200
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,200
Maybe.

1201
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,000
Amoco Embrace.

1202
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:37,800
Thank you, case.

1203
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,200
You are welcome Abner.

1204
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:48,899
All right.

1205
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:51,000
Well, that seems like it's about it.

1206
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,800
So you be doing the lutein character.

1207
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,600
This weekend.

1208
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:03,899
How many times I'm going to answer this question.

1209
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,500
I don't do game jams anymore.

1210
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:09,600
No no no, no.

1211
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,800
I think personally unless you're trying to practice I don't feel like

1212
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,600
we really need jams anymore.

1213
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,399
There's so many games getting made right now that the problem is

1214
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,500
usually attention to detail and taking your time to do stuff, right?

1215
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,300
Not that things are taking too long game, jams are more appropriate

1216
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,899
back when people were only making Giant games that took three years to

1217
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:32,399
make, but that's not the case anymore.

1218
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,300
If anything right now, people need the take a long time and do a good.

1219
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,000
Job on the game Jam.

1220
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:46,100
Not make a game in a weekend, which just we just don't really need

1221
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:46,399
like.

1222
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,500
That's, I don't see that as you feeling of particularly useful space.

1223
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:52,399
So really the only time I think people should really be doing game

1224
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:52,600
jams.

1225
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,900
These days is if they're trying to practice programming or whatever.

1226
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,900
You know, just trying to practice programming fast.

1227
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,000
So, all right, I'm a close it down.

1228
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,500
I'm going to close it down.

1229
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,000
Killer co uk sometimes the transition from scene to scene is not

1230
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,300
perfect.

1231
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,000
Are you going to fix that?

1232
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:12,500
Yes.

1233
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:18,900
So we haven't talked about that yet, but what that actually is and you

1234
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:23,000
know, if you think about it and you've been following the series, if

1235
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,200
you think about it you should be you should actually know what that

1236
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,400
is, right?

1237
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:39,800
And what it is, is, when the scenes switch, that's the first time that

1238
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:47,200
our system is getting asked for those resources, the bitmaps that are

1239
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,700
involved in that stream, right?

1240
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:54,700
And because we've got I don't remember how much we got.

1241
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:59,500
Like half a gigabyte of bitmaps in this cutscene, but we only gave the

1242
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,000
system like 256.

1243
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,000
To work with or something like that, right?

1244
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,800
So what that means is if you play through the entire set of cutscenes,

1245
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:09,700
by the time, you go back and loop around to the beginning of the

1246
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:14,400
cutscenes, again, all of the cut, all of it has fallen out of our of

1247
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
our asset cash, right?

1248
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,800
Because the rolling asset cash.

1249
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,100
So on that first frame,

1250
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:22,700
It does.

1251
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,000
The system goes oh, who.

1252
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,300
Oh, I don't have any of the bitmaps.

1253
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,300
I need to draw this Frame.

1254
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:28,900
Darn.

1255
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,700
Right.

1256
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,500
And so it doesn't dry anything and maybe you don't.

1257
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,500
Maybe it has time to load one of them or something.

1258
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:34,800
I don't know.

1259
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,200
But it's basically just can't do anything right.

1260
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,400
And so what you're seeing is that that period of paging in the

1261
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,200
bitmaps, right?

1262
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,400
So what we want to do is and this is what we'll do tomorrow is what we

1263
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,900
want to do is make it so that we look ahead at what will come in the

1264
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,400
next slice of time and prefetch the bitmaps.

1265
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,800
And if we've never done this before,

1266
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,200
For, but you'll notice that I kind of set us up for it right here.

1267
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,800
That's that's exactly what we want.

1268
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,600
And we've done the prefetching for sounds when we're playing streaming

1269
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,200
audio, but we never did this one.

1270
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,600
And that's exactly what it's for.

1271
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,600
What we want to do is like I said, we should playing time to us

1272
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,000
tomorrow.

1273
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,900
What we want to do is in that cutscene

1274
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,800
In addition, to rendering whatever our current T is we want to look

1275
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:35,500
forward, say you know, I don't know, a tenth of a second, a half a

1276
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:41,200
second or whatever we want to look forward a half of a second and ask

1277
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,900
for the prefetch of all the bitmaps that we see then, right?

1278
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:50,400
So, that's, that's what that's gonna, that's what that's going to do

1279
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,800
and that's what would fix.

1280
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:53,500
I think, what you were

1281
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,500
I'm assuming to assuming that you're talking about,

1282
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:58,400
that makes sense.

1283
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:04,400
But yeah.

1284
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,100
But this is kind of cool too.

1285
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,300
I guess if you look at it,

1286
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,600
This might be kind of amusing, although I guess we can't really, I

1287
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,000
don't know if we actually can see this.

1288
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,500
Because we're we still have the weird.

1289
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:26,500
Like, you know, we've got the loop Live code editing weird stuff, but

1290
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,700
we've never really gone an optimized properly.

1291
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,600
But in theory, we should be able to see that actually happen.

1292
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,800
So you can see right here when the scene changes.

1293
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:43,100
It loads new stuff in, but we also generally don't ever change our

1294
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,600
memory usage, so that's working exactly.

1295
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,100
As we designed it, remember, we designed it to use a certain amount of

1296
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:48,300
space.

1297
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,700
For stuff and then never use anymore.

1298
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,800
So, even though we now have more art resources than we actually can

1299
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,900
fit in our working set, it doesn't matter.

1300
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,800
It just works right?

1301
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,800
Which is kind of cool.

1302
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:04,200
So yeah.

1303
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,200
Let's see, anything else here.

1304
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,500
Yes, I guess that's about it.

1305
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,600
I guess that's about it.

1306
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:20,700
and then the thing too is you can kind of see

1307
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,300
CPU is here.

1308
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,300
The reason that we're not like we could peg this out.

1309
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,800
We could use a hundred percent since it's a software renderer, right?

1310
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:37,900
Since we render everything ourselves, you know, you might wonder why

1311
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,200
we aren't just going for a higher frame rate and pegging all this out.

1312
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:46,000
If you remember, we set the number of threads that do the rendering to

1313
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,700
a lower number than the number that was in the machine because it was

1314
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,300
interfering with OBS streaming,

1315
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:55,600
So, actually, if I switch, and I probably should do this at some point

1316
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,400
if I switch to streaming.

1317
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:04,100
From like a graphics capture thing and we can just Peg the CPU.

1318
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,700
If we just pegged the CPU, we get this.

1319
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:10,600
This would we can totally use 100% right to just, we can basically

1320
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,700
just like increase.

1321
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,300
The number of CPUs we use to get higher and higher frame rates that's

1322
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,200
just, you know, that's just the nature of a software renderer, right,

1323
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,400
because the CPU however, much CPU, we use determines what our frame

1324
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,700
rate is just.

1325
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,100
And, and so, yeah.

1326
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,500
So that's about it.

1327
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,500
Now, the other thing too is

1328
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,900
one thing that we can do if we wanted to for fun is we're really

1329
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:45,300
wasting a lot of time to on these because if you, if you think about

1330
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,700
what's actually happening with the way our render or works, we

1331
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:51,200
actually spend time drawing all of this stuff multiply call the

1332
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:51,700
overdraw.

1333
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,300
Actually happens, meaning like even places where we're not drawing

1334
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:55,900
anything.

1335
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,500
We're still spending time like doing texture sampling, they're

1336
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,400
determining, there's nothing there and whatever and we draw like from

1337
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,800
back to front so we actually waste time drawing stuff.

1338
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,000
Behind all the pieces that are moving, you know what I mean?

1339
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,700
And so there's a bunch of optimizations.

1340
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,500
We could choose to do to accelerate that now because computers are so

1341
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:17,200
darn fast.

1342
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,100
This is still rendering at a great frame rate even though we're not

1343
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,600
even using the GPU, which is just crazy when you think about because

1344
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,400
this is like very many layered depth scenes being composite in

1345
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,100
real-time with with no actual optimization of the depth complexity of

1346
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:32,700
the scene.

1347
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,800
It's kind of crazy how fast this is running, but I just want to point

1348
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,400
out that we could make it even faster.

1349
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,500
In fact, dramatically Faster by optimizing, that depth complexity.

1350
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,900
And so, you know, maybe someday if we wanted to, we could play around

1351
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,100
that because it'd be kind of fun.

1352
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:13,300
Let me step in here and help you guys out who are trying to answer

1353
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:14,100
curling champ.

1354
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,600
So, here's the thing.

1355
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:23,100
Basically, if you're going to program a GPU, you should know how to

1356
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:25,100
write a render yourself without one.

1357
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,300
If you don't, then you probably won't really understand how the GPU is

1358
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,200
actually working and you're kind of just throwing random stuff at it

1359
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,600
and not really understanding exactly how it works.

1360
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,100
So we wrote our own stuff.

1361
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:44,500
Renderer, which actually does exactly what the GPU does for the most

1362
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,700
part so that you can actually understand how the GPU works.

1363
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,000
And that's pretty critical, especially for going to optimize GPU

1364
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,700
performance.

1365
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,800
It's pretty critical to understand the works and very few people

1366
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,100
actually do, right?

1367
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,400
So that was a very important exercise that we were going to do now.

1368
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,700
Originally, I was just going to do that as a exercise to show, like,

1369
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,700
here's how it is.

1370
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,700
And then, of course, that's too slow because everyone knows that gpus

1371
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,100
or for

1372
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,100
X and CPU is not fast enough or whatever.

1373
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,600
So, it's just going to be an exercise, but then we it turned out that

1374
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,400
our, when we optimized our software renderer, it was so fast that it's

1375
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:26,100
actually just can run the game straight up, like it runs a game at,

1376
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,300
like, 60 frames a second, which is crazy.

1377
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,800
And so I decided the best thing to do would be to actually do the rest

1378
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,500
of the product that way, so that we actually have a complete software

1379
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,900
rendered version of the game that we can actually play, which is kind

1380
01:19:37,900 --> 01:19:38,400
of Awesome.

1381
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,200
And then later, you know, as an academic exercise certainly we can

1382
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:47,600
just sort of hook it up to a GPU, but it's kind of awesome that we

1383
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,600
don't even really have to do that if we don't want to, it's pretty

1384
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,200
darn cool.

1385
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,600
The Cockroach confirmed for familiar DLC.

1386
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,700
Clearly, we need a cockroach familiar.

1387
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,900
That's obviously true.

1388
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,200
Is there some interface to use for using the GPU?

1389
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,900
Yeah, like opengl and DirectX.

1390
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,200
That's what, that's what those are.

1391
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:30,300
That's, that's what they're made for to access the GPU.

1392
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:33,400
It's the most in-depth game, you've created, I cut scenes, game

1393
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,300
engine, and so on.

1394
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,100
No,

1395
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,000
Most of the things I've worked on in the past that are probably more

1396
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:40,900
complicated.

1397
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:48,400
Let's see your company 7108 perspective.

1398
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,000
Projection awesome.

1399
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,200
Good to know.

1400
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,800
Isn't glsl and the DirectX Shader language.

1401
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,700
Good for this.

1402
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Good for what?

1403
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,800
I'm not sure what you mean by good for this.

1404
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,800
Would it be possible to access DP without a driver?

1405
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,400
Not really.

1406
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:29,800
I mean, if you are running code in kernel mode, then in theory, you

1407
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,500
could basically write your own graphics driver.

1408
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,700
But you'd have to have all the documentation for the river which isn't

1409
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:36,000
available for things like NVIDIA drivers, for example, because they

1410
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,800
won't release it.

1411
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:46,600
So, you know, let's say you were using maybe an Intel GPU then maybe

1412
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,000
you could do something because that's fully documented.

1413
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:53,000
Maybe you could do something where like okay, you wrote your own, you

1414
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
know, kernel-mode specialty driver code, that writes directly the

1415
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,400
graphics card, then you can do stuff like that but in the general

1416
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,800
case, no, because Graphics vendors don't necessarily document their

1417
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,000
card and won't let you program to it directly.

1418
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,900
And so if you want to access say an Nvidia card, you pretty much have

1419
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:15,600
to go through one of their apis either opengl or DirectX or something

1420
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,100
similar.

1421
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,900
Curling Champion made here, a moving graphics on screen.

1422
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,300
Get the CPU to do other calculations.

1423
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:43,100
So at the risk of being dismissive, curling champ like I understand

1424
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,300
how to program computers.

1425
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:50,300
I'm not confused about the fact that you use the CPU and the GPU in

1426
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,700
tandem to produce Graphics.

1427
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:58,000
This is something that I do every day at work and made here is an

1428
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,400
educational series.

1429
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,100
It's supposed to show you how things work.

1430
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,400
So we don't do it that way because

1431
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,400
Is writing everything from scratch.

1432
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,500
Yourself is a pretty important part of this process a GPU is just a

1433
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:16,400
very restricted processing unit that you can offload, certain

1434
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,400
computations to, and knowing what those computations actually.

1435
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:25,400
Are is a critical part of learning to program, right?

1436
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,200
And so, it's really kind of obvious to everyone.

1437
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,100
Hopefully that if we wanted to run this to the GPU, we could

1438
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,000
It ain't hard, right?

1439
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,900
So it's not super helpful for you to keep talking about that because

1440
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:45,600
everyone already knows that and you can go back to the streams where

1441
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,000
I've talked about this at length, they're all on the video on demand.

1442
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:04,400
And just to be clear, we are not bit bleeding, these are not bit

1443
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,000
Blitz.

1444
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:11,200
These are actually full sub-pixel accurate by linearly sampled with

1445
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,000
rotation and scaling support.

1446
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,700
So this is nothing like a bit blit.

1447
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:19,800
This actually implements the actual full texture sampling that you

1448
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,600
would do just like a graphics card does.

1449
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:31,700
That's why this in fact also is really nice and smooth and doesn't

1450
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:36,400
have any of those annoying pixel like jumpy pixel artifacts that you

1451
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,000
get.

1452
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:42,600
If you look at like, even hilariously oftentimes, you'll look at games

1453
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,800
that do use a GPU but they don't understand how any of it works.

1454
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,800
So they still have like jumps pixel, to pixel as it moves and you're

1455
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,700
like, what are you doing, right?

1456
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,400
That's true.

1457
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,900
We do do gamma correction as well, but we don't do full gamma

1458
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:57,300
correction.

1459
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:57,700
We only

1460
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,300
Power of 2 gamma correction.

1461
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:04,400
We don't do like full srgb because I really don't see the point of it.

1462
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,500
Still have a little bit, still there, still a little bit of

1463
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:09,900
Schmutz.

1464
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,300
We gotta like align our layers a little bit better, but

1465
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,300
does bilinear filtering hold up in 3D?

1466
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:30,000
Yeah bilinear filtering is what most 3D runs on sometimes, you know,

1467
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,600
You can do better filtering like there's trilinear, there's an

1468
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,200
isotropic and those are usually for like filtering across MIT maps and

1469
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,800
stuff, but gpus generally do bilinear filtering, that's what they do.

1470
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:47,400
They don't do really much in the way of more advanced filtering for

1471
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,100
textures.

1472
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:49,300
So

1473
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,000
All right, so I think we're all good here.

1474
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,400
I think we're all good here.

1475
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,900
Handmade cut and me, cutscene screen sir for Christmas.

1476
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,000
It could happen.

1477
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:27,000
It could happen, we could ship one.

1478
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:40,600
Let me blow ya.

1479
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,200
As far as I can tell you set the clip playing your company pre-round.

1480
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,600
You okay?

1481
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:44,700
Yeah just making sure.

1482
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,800
All right, I'm going to call it a day.

1483
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:11,100
Let's see here.

1484
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,200
Let's see.

1485
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:16,500
All right, thank you for joining me for another episode of handmade

1486
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:16,800
hero.

1487
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,200
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1488
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,000
As always, if you want to follow the series, you can always pre-order

1489
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,600
the game comes to the source code so that you can play around with

1490
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,500
like what we did on stream and also the our packs up there as well.

1491
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,400
So if you want to play around with the cutscene art to sort of

1492
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,200
practice, doing some of that stuff that we were showing, you can do

1493
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:35,800
that as well.

1494
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,400
We also have a forum if you want site if you want to go ask questions.

1495
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,800
We have a patreon page.

1496
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,700
If you would like to support the video series, you can always

1497
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:42,900
subscribe.

1498
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,700
If they're we have a tweetbot the tweets is scheduled to you except

1499
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,200
when they reboot my server and then it doesn't I'm going to have to

1500
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:51,800
restart him.

1501
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,700
The poor little guy he got killed but when he's actually allowed to

1502
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,600
run he tweets the schedule at you.

1503
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,500
And speaking of the schedule, I'll be back here.

1504
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:01,600
5 p.m.

1505
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,300
I believe Pacific Standard time tomorrow.

1506
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:03,800
You know what?

1507
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,700
I got to look to make sure that's true because I forget sometimes what

1508
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,500
the schedule is, I think so, yeah, that is correct.

1509
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,800
So back here 5 p.m.

1510
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:20,200
Pacific Standard time tomorrow and yeah that's that's the place to be.

1511
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,000
If you would like to see how we're going to make sure that we always

1512
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,200
prefetch our bitmaps that's we're going to do tomorrow to that make

1513
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,300
sure that those transitions from cutscene to cutscene always roll

1514
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:36,500
smoothly until then have fun programming and I'll see you guys on the

1515
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:36,900
internet.

1516
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,800
Take it easy, everyone.
