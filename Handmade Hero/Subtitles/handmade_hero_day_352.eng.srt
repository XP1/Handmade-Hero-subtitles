00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,400
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,100
The show Rico to complete game live on stream.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
We are back after taking a break, we took a break post handmade Khan

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
and we did a couple streams.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,000
During that time, we did some streams on people, switching careers,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
from whatever their current career was to a career in software

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,600
development and we had a bunch of really cool stories people wrote in,

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,700
so we read those so definitely check that out.

9
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,700
If you haven't seen that already, it's kind of an interesting side

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,900
side that side project but I guess

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,100
Side stream to handmade hear, a sort of like additional information,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,500
and I kind of shouldn't doing some stuff like that just in general as

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,400
because one of the things that I talked about in those streams

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,400
specifically was just the fact that a lot of times on how many here I

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,000
get asked questions that I don't know the answers to not technical

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,800
questions, but like personal questions.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,500
Like, you know what, you know, what would you recommend if I'm trying

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,900
to switch careers to?

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,000
To software development, or what should I learn?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,700
If I'm going to start doing game development and these sorts of

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,200
things?

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,100
And a lot of times it's like, well, you know, I haven't written a

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,200
surly been through the kind of circumstances that other people have.

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,900
You know, I started programming a very early age so I don't know what

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,800
it's like to come at it later on in life and decide.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
You want to make a switch to it, those sorts of things.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,900
So I find it really helped doing this.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,400
This pastor is a streams, I found it really helped to just like ask

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:31,900
people.

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,900
You know, because there's a lot of people out there who now follow the

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,900
show, which is awesome.

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,400
And they're willing to tell us their stories about what happened to

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,600
them when they did go through those those different paths in life

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,200
towards getting to being a software developer as their primary career.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,700
And so I'm kind of interested in doing some more of those, you know,

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,800
just further down the line whenever we take a break or whatever maybe

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,900
in in the interim during those breaks or whatever just asking people

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,500
People to write in and seeing if we do get any time we get a good

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,600
collection of story, it's just kind of doing a thing where we read

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,900
them because I think it's pretty handy and it just kind of gives a

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,000
broader perspective on things than I can give by myself.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,600
Because I don't really have any experiences to draw upon other than my

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,900
own, which are, I think actually relatively unusual, right?

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,000
Like, I'd, I don't know that there's that many people who started

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
programming as early as I did.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,800
And who really haven't explored any other career options.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
It's not necessarily the common

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
For software development.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,300
So it doesn't necessarily provide a lot of utility to people who are

50
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,100
coming at it later than that you know.

51
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,100
Even if it's something as late as doing it in high school, it's still

52
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,300
pretty early by most standards but was much later than I ever consider

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,700
getting into it.

54
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,600
So I really just don't have much knowledge of that, you know.

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,300
I don't really have the the personal experience to draw from to sort

56
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,800
of say, like, all this is what it was like.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,900
This is what was hard.

58
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,600
It was easy, because what's hard to a seven-year-old is very different

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,200
than what's hard to a 15 year-old potentially, which is much different

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,500
perhaps than what's different for a 30 year old, right?

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Because their life circumstances have changed quite a bit and their

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,300
existing knowledge base and what they've already sort of grown to do,

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,700
habitually in life and these sorts of things change, very dramatically

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,900
over those, you know, sort of parts of your life.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,100
So anyway,

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
I'd like to get back to programming.

67
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,200
Now, we're here at a 352 and I believe hopefully our to-do list is

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,900
still pretty good guide in terms of what we want to do.

69
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,300
And I believe we're just sort of tying things up.

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:56,300
We really don't have much to do in terms of game engine stuff anymore.

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Like, I feel like we've taken a reasonable amount of time to go

72
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,600
through.

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Just sort of demonstrate how to look at a game engine, all the

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
different parts of it and we've sort of done everything that you might

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,800
think you might want to have in a game engine in terms of like at

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
least one example of how that thing might be done.

77
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
And so we were just looking at finishing up this multiple SIM Regents

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,500
per frame stuff and the multiple SIM regions per frame.

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,900
Stuff is just a way of us trying to figure out.

80
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,000
Can we leverage multiple processors in the machine to simulate?

81
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,900
Different places in the game separately, right?

82
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,500
And there's a couple different things that was important for us to

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,900
sort of figure out how to do there and we're sort of working through

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,000
those.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,200
So just continuing down that path a little bit just to do some stuff

86
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,800
like clean up the camera usage and that sort of thing on the other

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,300
hand

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,100
After that, I think.

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,100
And it's still a guess a little bit of a question, but I'm pretty sure

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,200
that I would like to do it.

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,300
I might want to rewrite one thing that we've done, which is that we

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,700
did our renderer in 2D and I'm kind of glad we did that, because I've

93
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,800
never done really a 2d renderer before for the most part.

94
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Like, it's just not something that I have experience with.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,600
I've always really done 3D even, you know, very early on in my sort of

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,100
programming.

97
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,000
I think even as early as you know when

98
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,800
A little before like maybe Junior High School.

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,500
I think was probably the last time I ever really did much in the way

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,400
of 2D engine work to be honest.

101
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,900
And so you know I had never really done a 2d engine and so I just

102
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,300
don't love it.

103
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,700
Like I feel like there's just too much in it that sort of not flowing

104
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
through a nice uniform pipeline.

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,800
There's just too many special cases for things that I don't really

106
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,200
like it.

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,400
so I think I would prefer to sort of upgrade our Graphics to sort of

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
3D now that doesn't really mean we're going to pull in any 3D assets

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
but I'm basically just

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,100
About hey instead of rendering tiles.

111
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,000
Maybe I'll render like little cubes you know more like a Minecraft

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,900
sort of style where the the textures are on the sides of the of the

113
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
cubes or on the front of the cubes or whatever.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,300
So when you have like raised pieces it's actually like a little 3D

115
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,600
thing and then the actual characters are actual Z buffered stand up,

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,700
you know cards.

117
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,600
And the reason I want to do that is just because although the z-buffer

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
is something that you, you know, you don't necessarily want to use if

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,400
you can avoid it because obviously well it cost bandwidth for one

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:29,800
thing.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,900
But primary reason being that that you can't necessarily do as much

122
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,000
with transparency and stuff like this.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,100
If you count on the Z, buffer to resolve your debt problems for you

124
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:50,400
without sorting, those are pretty minor concerns compared to all of

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,300
the stuff that we had to do to sort of make sorting work reasonably

126
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,900
and I really just didn't like that.

127
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,000
I feel like it's it just creates an ugly engine that with a lot of

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
Sort of pitfalls in it.

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,700
And so I would like to make that transition before we move on to just

130
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,300
writing regular game code where we're not really thinking about the

131
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,400
engine particularly much anymore, and we're just working on things

132
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
like how to enemies behave.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,600
And how do we want rooms to be generated and that sort of stuff.

134
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,900
So that is, I think what we want to get to is just this little break

135
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,800
point here and then we'll do this thing and do a sort of 3D graphics.

136
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,600
Upgrade.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,900
And just kind of move our stuff over to that and then Collision

138
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,500
detection, I'm not actually sure how much we actually need.

139
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,600
We already implemented the main kind that we wanted, which is the fact

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,800
that people can't stand on squares that are occupied and that's done.

141
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,900
So the other kind really is just for probably mostly projectiles

142
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,400
things, hitting other things like that.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,700
And so now that we know exactly what we need that for just going

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,600
through those routines and cleaning them up and doing like solid

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
implementations of them because I put in one a long time ago, there

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,900
was a really basic implementation.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,400
That is not one that we want to ship, but that's still in there and

148
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,200
just moving that out and making it a little bit more.

149
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
Reasonable is all I'm really talking about.

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,200
So that's it.

151
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,800
A i storage is probably not something that we can really tackle at the

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,500
moment.

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,200
And the reason for that is

154
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,900
In order to have something like a i storage.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,900
We have to have some notion of an AI.

156
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,200
Who wants to remember things from frame to frame?

157
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Meaning, right now, we pretty much only have enemies who do their

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,700
planning in a very local sense, and who don't store particularly much

159
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,400
information.

160
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,600
We don't have, for example a enemy which needs to store complex World

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,800
Knowledge or something like

162
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,700
I don't know that we really need to ever have anything like that.

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,300
It's kind of on the to-do list here, just because it was sort of a

164
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,600
thought of like, well, we haven't developed anything for that Tech.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Should we need something like that?

166
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,300
But I don't really have anything in mind.

167
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,600
That would require anything particularly complicated here.

168
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,600
You know, I guess the thing that I would say is like, even something

169
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,100
like pathfinding, I don't know that we really need anything in

170
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,600
particular with storage.

171
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,800
We can probably just in the entities themselves store a few steps of

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,900
path if we want, that sort of thing.

173
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
So I don't know.

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:41,600
So,

175
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,500
Going to just basically say that that probably isn't going to happen

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,800
until we actually need it if we need it.

177
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,700
Because I don't think it's particularly relevant at all.

178
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,700
So I think.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Yeah, like I said really, what we want to do here is just focus on

180
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,000
finishing up the multiple submarines, multiple some regions per frame.

181
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,600
I think that's the last thing that we were looking at before we could

182
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,900
basically say like, all right, not really anything else to do here.

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
So let's go ahead and do the 3D upgraded

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,100
We'll just do the graphics and and collision for 3D and and call it a

185
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,400
day.

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,100
Engine wise.

187
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,200
And really that would mostly be, it's not a huge deal to upgrade

188
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,700
something to from 2D to 3D.

189
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,300
It's mostly just going to be sort of me having to explain a few things

190
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,900
that we did not cover in much detail because we didn't actually need

191
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,300
to.

192
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
We tend to think of things, mostly a screen space.

193
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
We have introduced anything like clip space, for example.

194
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,600
So there's some things about a 3D pipeline that we kind of need to

195
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,000
talk about but otherwise, there really isn't much.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,300
We have to do in practice.

197
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,200
Then sort of make more rigorous our ideas about where things are in 3D

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,700
and how we're going to deal with them, because we already have a

199
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,300
back-end that supports opengl and stuff like this.

200
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,400
So moving that over to just using regular 3D is simply a question of

201
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
working out the math, a little more carefully and showing like how

202
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
that sort of stuff works.

203
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,500
There isn't like a whole re-architecting that has to happen or

204
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,300
anything like that.

205
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Plus, we are already sending stuff down to our render in three

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,200
dimensions.

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,000
We already provide 3D positions for things and so really all we need

208
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,800
to do there is just instead of pre-processing that into 2D rectangles

209
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
that are in screen space which is kind of what we're doing now.

210
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,400
We're just going to leave that data untouched and pass it down more

211
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,700
directly and that's really all we're talking about here.

212
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,900
So again not really that complicated what we're talking about, it's

213
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,500
not really a big deal so I'm not anticipating that to be a huge thing

214
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,800
in

215
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,300
In terms of actual stuff we need to do.

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,300
But it is a rather big deal in terms of us kind of trying to teach a

217
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,800
bunch of stuff that is

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Not necessarily important in the when you only have two t.

219
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,700
So it will take a while to do because we're going to have the ticket

220
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,300
fairly slowly.

221
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,700
And I'm going to have to go through a bunch of Concepts that we don't

222
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,600
really have to visit in the 2D sense.

223
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,800
But other than that it would be pretty straightforward.

224
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I think.

225
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,600
Okay.

226
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,400
So, let's remind ourselves where we are here.

227
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Pretty much.

228
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
Like I said, everything, I think is,

229
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
Is still kind of very straightforward right?

230
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Where everything still running, okay.

231
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,000
And our kind of weird AI is jumping around and are weird like head

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,900
based particles.

233
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,000
I got to have to ask Anna what she wants for particles.

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm assuming she'll want some particle Sprites but yeah, basically

235
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,300
there's not really that much in terms of stuff that we don't have, as

236
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,700
we kind of talked about before, we're pretty good to go on engine

237
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,300
stuff.

238
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
So I think the only thing we really want to do is finish up the

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,200
multiple SIM region stuff.

240
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,200
And we'll go ahead and and deal with them.

241
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,400
We'll go ahead and deal with our 3D changes.

242
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,100
Now, one of the interesting things to hear is that I'm pretty pleased

243
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,600
with how everything is working as well.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,900
You know, like I said, we've got some stuff that's not as good as you

245
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,500
know, maybe we would want it to be, but one thing that is pretty nice

246
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,600
is, you know, we already handle all the stuff we kind of wanted to

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,200
handle and it pretty worked up pretty well, at least so far.

248
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,400
Now, we haven't, you know, shipped anything yet so it's, you know,

249
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,700
it's too early to declare Victory on anything certainly.

250
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,900
But our design seems to be holding up relatively.

251
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,300
Well, you know, this world can be arbitrarily big.

252
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,900
We tried just slapping down tons of rooms and we don't suffer really

253
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
any performance penalties, right?

254
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,700
We still run at 60 frames a second.

255
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,500
Everything's fine.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,400
Even though we can simulate as much of the world right now is we kind

257
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,400
of want to and we successfully we don't suffer from any floating Point

258
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,000
Precision.

259
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
None of these things.

260
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,600
So all the stuff that we kind of wanted as far as I know, we've pretty

261
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:01,700
much

262
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,600
Each got right.

263
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,400
So we can we can literally create worlds that would be extraordinarily

264
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,900
large here, I could walk through all of them and none of it's a

265
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,500
problem.

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,500
And again we also can simulate as much of it as we want to at the

267
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,100
moment.

268
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And, you know, just and the parts that we don't want to simulate don't

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,900
have to be simulated, and it doesn't create any issues.

270
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,700
Etc, etc.

271
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,000
So all that stuff, seems pretty good and I'm relatively happy with it.

272
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
But like I said, the the to dienes part of

273
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm not particularly psyched about so yeah.

274
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,700
Anyway, so that's really all there is to that.

275
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,600
I'm going to go ahead here and exit out of here.

276
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,100
In terms of the simulation region stuff, it's going to take us a

277
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,600
little bit.

278
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,600
We haven't programmed in a while to kind of get back into it, but if

279
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,200
you remember what we were doing before in World mode here, you can

280
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,400
kind of see where we've got simulation happening.

281
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,800
You can see where we were playing around with this.

282
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,800
Here is the actual primary region of the game, where the player is

283
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,500
standing.

284
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,100
This is where we do the work.

285
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
That we actually want to do for the game, you see.

286
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,100
But up here, we had an example of what happens when you want to do

287
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,100
simulation for the part of the game that you can't see.

288
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
And hear, we basically, like,

289
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Farm off a bunch of threads which all those threads can go and do

290
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,100
actual simulation of different parts of the game.

291
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,300
So what that looks like right is right now.

292
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,600
Other parts of the world are being simulated.

293
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,300
If we take a look at the profile, you can kind of see that happening.

294
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,900
Here, I'll go ahead and pause the profile on a frame here and you can

295
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,500
kind of see that we've got World simulation happening on a number of

296
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,600
threads, right?

297
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
So that

298
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Really just to allow us the opportunity to take advantage to

299
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,400
multiprocessor, machines, to stimulate more of the game world than we

300
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:01,800
could.

301
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,900
If we were only simulating one on one core of the machine.

302
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Now, we don't really need this yet obviously, so it's just sort of a

303
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,300
test to make sure that the technology would hold up, okay?

304
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,600
If that's something that we wanted to do, but, you know, like I said,

305
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,100
it's good to.

306
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,900
It was good to

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,800
Just figure out like would we be able to do that with our with our

308
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,400
architecture?

309
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
And the answer appears to be?

310
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:29,900
Yes.

311
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:36,700
Now what I wrote down in terms of to dues for that is well okay you

312
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,500
know we have a number of things about the Sim that we you know we

313
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,800
tried to clean up the fact that they're running a multiple we try to

314
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,600
kind of isolate.

315
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,300
What we were going to do with the simulation and you can see here in

316
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,900
do World Sim exactly what needs

317
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,000
It done, it creates a memory Arena.

318
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,700
It does a begins him step which is like preparing to do simulation.

319
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,900
It does a simulate step, which does the actual simulation and as an

320
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
enzyme, which would have finish this up.

321
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,300
And then it, like, freeze, the memory was going to be using one of the

322
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,800
things that we wanted to do was not do this anymore.

323
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,300
We wanted to sort of have a Rena's that were set up specifically for

324
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,400
work on multiple threads.

325
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:24,700
So that

326
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,500
It's something we definitely want to look at in a second and then the

327
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,400
other thing is here in update and render world.

328
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,300
You can see why we broke it down that way.

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,600
We have this concert begins him again but then there's other stuff

330
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,500
that we might want to do like check for joining players and then we do

331
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,800
simulate, right?

332
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,700
And then we do and some all the way at the end and while the

333
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,000
simulation is open, we also draw some things that we care about and do

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
things like taking the the camera deltas and that sort of stuff,

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,500
right?

336
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,800
And so, you know what we tried to do here is basically make that

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Relation of stuff work so that we could do it in both cases and use

338
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,800
the same code in both cases.

339
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,000
One, one of the cases is we're just going to go ahead and simulate the

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
game part that you actually see.

341
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
And the other case is we're trying to simulate something where it's

342
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,000
off screen.

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,400
So we don't care about the camera.

344
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
We don't care about drawing any additional things like at all, we

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,900
don't care about checking for joining players because they wouldn't be

346
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,400
joining in those regions.

347
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,300
They be joining in the region, we could see etcetera etcetera,

348
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,400
So that's what we did and that was all relatively good but there's

349
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
still some stuff in there.

350
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,500
Like so for example, if we take a look at what happens here in and

351
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,900
World change, which is a big part of vensim, right?

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
If we take a look here, a 10 cm, you can see that, mostly what enzyme

353
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,900
in is is just finishing, the use of the temporary memory, for whatever

354
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,700
that temporary memory is and calling and World change.

355
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,000
Whoo-hoo Tire boy.

356
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,100
All right.

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,900
So and World change when it comes through here.

358
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,400
A lot of the work that it does is checking this you know, camera

359
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,700
following entity index situation, right?

360
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,900
And what that does is, that's just a thing, which updates the camera

361
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,500
in the case, where the entity that the camera is supposed to track is

362
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,900
in this simulation region.

363
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,900
And so the sort of the aspects of that that I'm interested in here is

364
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,900
saying, well, I don't really love that because I don't

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
really feel like that's appropriate thing to be stuck in the middle of

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,300
this multi-platform simulation stuff necessarily

367
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,200
It's kind of hard to say so I'm not sure that we want that happening

368
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,800
all the time in here.

369
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,500
Now maybe we do maybe we don't it's kind of hard to say but if you see

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,900
how this goes, in fact let me go ahead and just demonstrate this.

371
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,100
If you see how this goes, it creates an entirely weird dependency here

372
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,000
on the same region stuff that really wouldn't have existed for any

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
other reason, we have to reach into the world mode structure and deal

374
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
with this camera following entity index bit here.

375
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,200
But the only reason that we have to do that is because we're updating

376
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
the camera right here in line.

377
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,500
And so it creates this weird sort of knowledge in the same region of

378
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
the whole game World situation for no reason other than it needs to

379
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
have this camera, following entity index.

380
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,900
And so, you know, is there anything wrong with that?

381
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,800
Not necessarily, but it does mean that I've sort of created a

382
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,900
dependency that I wouldn't ordinarily have and you can see here when

383
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,000
we do begin World change, we do not need any of that.

384
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,900
That right?

385
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,100
We only care about the actual world struct.

386
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,100
The, you know, the

387
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Thing that actually stores the data for the world, which makes sense

388
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
because that's what we're operating on.

389
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,600
But, you know, our ending World change is not symmetric, you know, it

390
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,800
should

391
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,300
Look like that because it's just ending the simulation of this world

392
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,800
region.

393
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
But instead, it takes this because of that sort of ancillary camera

394
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,700
aspect.

395
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,600
So what I'm kind of interested in here is like, can this be pulled out

396
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,300
as well into a special-purpose thing?

397
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,000
That's only there for people who care about the camera and isn't there

398
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,400
for people who don't care about the camera.

399
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,500
So that it's not sort of creating this artificial dependency between

400
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,400
these two systems that are really isn't quite there if you will and

401
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:29,800
you know again.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,400
Then why do I care about that?

403
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,700
And mainly, the reason I care about that is that in general, I like to

404
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,300
try and separate out things which are really dependent and things

405
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,600
which are not really dependent.

406
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:48,100
And the reason for that, is that it just makes code simpler to, to

407
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
maintain over time, right?

408
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,400
In a circumstance, where everything talks to everything, right?

409
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Where all of my routines are grabbing stuff from everywhere, it makes

410
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
it very hard to isolate it

411
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,800
Your piece of the code and say, Here's exactly what this does.

412
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
And here's exactly what it needs to function.

413
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,400
Right.

414
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,100
It gets it harder, it makes it harder to continue to do that because I

415
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
never really know what other things.

416
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,300
You know.

417
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,800
It's too hard to keep that out in your head potentially at once.

418
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,800
What parts are depend on other parts.

419
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,800
So reducing those dependencies

420
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,200
Is just a helpful tool when you see a dependency like this one that

421
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,400
really doesn't need to be there.

422
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,700
Removing, it is usually a good thing to consider for that reason.

423
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,800
This is very much like again sort of the functional programming style

424
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,900
of looking at things just to a lesser degree, right?

425
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,800
It's saying you know, functional programming is about saying there are

426
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,700
no side effects and I pass in everything that I that I need to operate

427
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,500
on explicitly.

428
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
It's and so on and so.

429
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Right.

430
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,800
And, you know, if you want to take it to the nth degree, you would

431
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,800
say, well, I'm going to pass in literally, everything by value, right?

432
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,000
Like, I'm going to enumerate, absolutely everything this thing needs

433
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,600
and take as return everything that it possibly could touch.

434
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,300
You know, taking that to the nth degree is is, you know, maybe the

435
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
purest functional programming, you could imagine doing or something, I

436
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,100
don't really need to do that, but I do believe in minimizing

437
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
dependencies and side effects where possible.

438
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,700
No because again it just makes it easier to think about the program.

439
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,800
You know, it's very a purely functional program is very easy to reason

440
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,100
about because it just doesn't have very much.

441
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,200
You have to look at, you can see from the function signature in a

442
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
purely functional program.

443
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,500
Exactly what a function needs and what it does, right?

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,500
And that's very handy, by contrast in something that does a lot of

445
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,100
side effects.

446
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
It's very hard to understand necessarily all of the things that it

447
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,700
touches that's also what makes

448
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,000
it powerful and it's why side effect based programming is the kind of

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
programming that almost everything is

450
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,100
At some level.

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Again, just because you need to do that to Be an Effective program, or

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,900
it doesn't mean, you don't also want to appreciate what you're sort of

453
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
giving up for that freedom and ability.

454
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,800
And that is sort of that understanding of exactly what a function

455
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,900
actually touches and what it could do.

456
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,300
So in this case, that's why I've sort of singled this parameter out

457
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,300
here is something that I'm like, well, I don't really believe that

458
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,600
this routine needs access to that.

459
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,900
And I would rather have a version of

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,800
The team that didn't do it.

461
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,800
So the question is how do I you know like if I was going to pull this

462
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,600
out let's just see what does that actually look like, right?

463
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,600
Scram get this here.

464
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,900
So here I've pulled it out.

465
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Oops, gotta get my key bindings, I forgot I changed my key bindings,

466
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,100
one of my key bindings for Fork Road, it was only one of them, but I

467
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,900
changed on my debe.

468
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,000
She never got to move it over here.

469
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,100
So if you look at what happens here, this is where

470
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,200
camera code used to happen here.

471
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,400
So, just put that in for a second so you can see what happens here,

472
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:18,800
right?

473
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,200
We used to do this, mapping the map in a trunk space bit and then we

474
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,900
would do some stuff with the movement of the enmity.

475
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,300
And then, you know, we would update camera code and then we would sort

476
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,600
of retire that information back into the world, a structure.

477
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,800
And this is the place where eventually we would sort of pack the data

478
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,500
for the entity, but we're not doing that the

479
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,800
Because again, we don't have a need to do that up until like more

480
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,700
towards the end of development, when we're more cared about space and

481
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,500
speed and so on.

482
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
So that's all that is.

483
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,500
But now we can look up here and say, okay, so if somebody wanted to do

484
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,400
this part of the process, right, what do they actually need?

485
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,300
So, let's take a look and see what if I was to make this a function

486
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,400
that was just, you know,

487
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,700
update camera or something like that for, you know, entity movement or

488
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,900
something like this, right?

489
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,500
So if I was going to do that, the question now becomes.

490
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,800
All right, so if I was going to update the camera for any movement

491
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,500
here, what would I want to do?

492
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
You know, if I was passing the stuff in?

493
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,700
So, you know, I've got an entity structure, right?

494
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,900
Obviously that's going to work.

495
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Let's take a look at what our other compiler errors.

496
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,900
Are what do we actually need here?

497
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
So we've got the world mode.

498
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,700
All right, fine, we'll pass the world mode in for the moment, game

499
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
mode world, I think.

500
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,400
Yeah,

501
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,300
And we also need the world.

502
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
And we need the entity P.

503
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Alright, so let's take a look here.

504
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,600
We're looking at the room based camera.

505
00:26:59,600 --> 00:26:59,900
That's the

506
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Only one we actually want.

507
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,300
Right?

508
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,600
So if we're taking a look at what would happen here, maybe we just

509
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,300
say, well this is the part we actually care about we don't do the

510
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,600
other kind of camera anymore.

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,600
So if I want that, what do I get right?

512
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
And it looks like just from doing that.

513
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,100
It looks like this function is essentially totally isolated mobile,

514
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,400
right?

515
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
So that's actually perfect.

516
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,700
I want to look at what the world what the world's actually used for

517
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,100
here because it says it wants the world's what's going on there?

518
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,900
Oh, that was just

519
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,900
To test some we're is that used, okay, so we need map into chunk,

520
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,100
space to figure out what we're doing with the camera there.

521
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,000
So we need that's why we need that.

522
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,900
So if we were going to update the camera for any movement, you know,

523
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,300
it would look something like this.

524
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,600
Okay, but now, like I said, we've sort of pulled that out we're still

525
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
in debug build, right?

526
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,200
No.

527
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,100
Okay, so we've pulled that out, right?

528
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,300
But now if we ran our camera wouldn't function more because we're

529
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
never calling it right?

530
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,800
That thing never gets called by anybody, right?

531
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,300
So if I come through here and, you know, we'll do whatever we're

532
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,300
doing, I can walk off the screen and and, you know, not good, right?

533
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,900
Not great.

534
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,900
So,

535
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
At that point.

536
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,000
The question is who calls this and why, right?

537
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,600
And when so, we don't probably need to do this anymore where we say,

538
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,600
like entity ID Value, World mode, camera following entity index, the

539
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
any of that stuff, right?

540
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,800
All I really need to do because I can access entities is, I just need

541
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,400
to make sure that when I pass this, I'm only passing the entity that I

542
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
actually care about here.

543
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,400
And in fact, in some sense we could pull out the

544
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
No camera stuff into its own thing.

545
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,500
We won't do that at the moment, but anyway,

546
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
So really what I can do here is to say, hey you're only going to call

547
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,900
this thing with this ended with the entity that you're actually

548
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,500
following.

549
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,500
And so,

550
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,300
Shooting and so we can just assert that no one's trying to do that

551
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,900
with any other entity for the moment.

552
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,200
Right?

553
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,400
And later on, we may want to do stuff where we change how that works

554
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,800
or something.

555
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
But you know, for the moment we'll do it this way.

556
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,600
So okay, so if we're going to do update camera for any movement, we'd

557
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,800
pass in the entity, that is the one that matches the camera following

558
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,500
editing index.

559
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,000
But we need to do that somewhere, right?

560
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,700
And so, if I go into the world mode itself here and I take a look,

561
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,500
We're we're doing the main update.

562
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
You know, this is sort of where we would want to do that in that

563
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,100
stuff.

564
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,200
It would normally I guess happen right here because this is where this

565
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,800
is before the enzyme would happen.

566
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,300
Right answer.

567
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,500
If I was going to do that.

568
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,700
I could just call update camera for end of the movement and I could

569
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,300
pass the world in the world mode.

570
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,400
And the only thing I would need here is the camera entity, right?

571
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,100
And I don't know what that entity is.

572
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
So the question is, where do I get that in any from?

573
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,500
Well, in the same region stuff, we should be able to access, it editi

574
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,700
by its ID because we already have to do that for a bunch of reasons,

575
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,400
right?

576
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,100
So, we've got a function right here that will use the hash table in

577
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
the same region for this.

578
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,900
Very purpose.

579
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,200
So we should be able to just call that here and get an entity by the

580
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,900
ID, which we know because it's from the world mode, the camera, right?

581
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,500
That's exactly what it's from.

582
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,900
So, here is my begin Sim, right?

583
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,400
And I'm going to get back the world, Sim the world Sim has the same

584
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,200
region in it.

585
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
So I know that inside here, I can just access that.

586
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,500
And then the only question is, well, where is that?

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,900
You know, what's the entity ID that I need?

588
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,000
Well, that was exactly.

589
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,700
Only the thing that we were just talking about here, we actually store

590
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,400
whatever that entity index is.

591
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,700
We store that in the world mode, that's the entity that we're

592
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,100
following with the camera at the time.

593
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,300
So I just passed those two in.

594
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,200
It should give me back the camera entity, right?

595
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,000
And I assume I can also say well, okay, you know, if there is no

596
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,900
camera entity, don't try to update it.

597
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,500
But presumably there always is for the most part, right?

598
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,600
All right, so now in theory, I should be able to follow my My Little

599
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,800
Hero, friend here.

600
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
He should be able to hop out of the room.

601
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,400
There we go, there we go.

602
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,300
And you know, we've basically just restored that functionality.

603
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:57,300
But now that routine doesn't actually have any problem with being

604
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,000
coupled sort of, to the ending of the simulation.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,500
So that's good.

606
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,600
Now, that's out of there.

607
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,000
And I like that better because now we can see more concisely sort of

608
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,700
what's happening with the begin World change and World change.

609
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,900
I might go ahead as well and just say, let's move those two functions

610
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,700
next to each other.

611
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,000
Our tears, begin World change, right?

612
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And here's and World change and that way I can sort of also just see

613
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,200
them, right?

614
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,700
Oh it's like looks like that.

615
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,000
May be easier said than done.

616
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,900
This can certainly move out of there though.

617
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,300
We go.

618
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,300
And let's see, create an MD, delete, MD pack, entity reference, create

619
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,500
edit.

620
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,200
And delete entity.

621
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,600
Certainly don't need to be there.

622
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,300
Those can go outside as well.

623
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,800
I think.

624
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:48,900
Damn.

625
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,800
And so really it's just there to packing things that will intercede.

626
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,400
So anyway, I think that's it for that and you know I could put these

627
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,300
above it as well.

628
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,800
I could say those go right here.

629
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,600
And then we can just see relatively easily.

630
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,600
Those two routines.

631
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Here's the begin World change one, which is getting relatively

632
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,400
respectable.

633
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,700
And then there's the end will change one, which is also getting

634
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,600
relative respectable.

635
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,500
And so it's got the pack in the unpack there and the, the pack and

636
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,400
unpack again, will then become more of a real thing.

637
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,800
You know, far further down the line, once the games already, you know,

638
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,000
more complete the game part of the game, not the engine.

639
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:30,800
So that's it.

640
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,300
Okay.

641
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,000
So if I take a look at pulling out the camera concept and something

642
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,700
clear an optional, I think that's really all I need to do right now.

643
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,900
We could take it one step further.

644
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,700
I don't know if we want to and that step further is inside the game

645
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,600
mode thing.

646
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,500
Here, you can kind of see, we've got camera offset, camera P, last

647
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,100
camera, speed camera, following entity index those things could be put

648
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,500
into a camera structure.

649
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,700
So for example, we could say something like this

650
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,100
which would essentially be

651
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:05,700
oops.

652
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,100
That sort of thing.

653
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,400
And then what would happen is any time we were working on something

654
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,800
like this, where we were previously talking about the world mode, we

655
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,500
would not necessarily use the world mode anymore, so if we take a look

656
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,300
at what happens with World mode here, you can see that almost in every

657
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,199
case we're talking about the actual camera stuff.

658
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,800
So the only place we're using the world mode as the world mode is by

659
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,800
looking at the room, Delta and the room Delta is really sort of

660
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,300
More of a property of where you are in the world at that point, so

661
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,000
that probably should be more of a query on the world, not on the world

662
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,900
mode anyway.

663
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,300
But anyway, so if you take a look at what happens in there, if I just

664
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,000
scan through sort of what's Happening Here, you can kind of see that

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,600
in a lot of cases, we're updating this, it would just be like a adding

666
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
an extra dot in here.

667
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
So let's go ahead and do that since I took that stuff anyway or just

668
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,800
him showing.

669
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,400
How do that step?

670
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,700
You know, let's just change this to

671
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,400
Stew last p and p an offset and following entity index.

672
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
And then we'll go ahead and switch on here.

673
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,100
So if I just do something like this, right?

674
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,300
See how that's changing.

675
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,100
All I'm really doing is is changing it to a dot in all of these cases.

676
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,300
Nothing, particularly exciting.

677
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,800
Hear that.

678
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,500
And again, same thing.

679
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's take a look at this so that's would just be this one kind of

680
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,100
inverts itself a little bit.

681
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,600
That's camera.

682
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,200
Last P.

683
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,600
There's camera P, almost done again.

684
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Just a mechanical transform here.

685
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,900
Just literally pushing it down one level.

686
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,100
First, there's our camera P.

687
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,600
Again,

688
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,300
And Camera offset.

689
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
Let's take a look at this here.

690
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,300
There's

691
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,000
and,

692
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,900
Almost done.

693
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,900
Okay.

694
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,800
So at that point again, now we've just all we've done is just kind of

695
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,200
move code into a different place.

696
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,200
We should get rid of.

697
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm like, I'm kind of tired of those weird teleport regions, which we

698
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,800
were playing with before.

699
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Let's go ahead and stop that.

700
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,800
Poor fellow for from bouncing around so much.

701
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,400
There we go.

702
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,500
Where were those things?

703
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,900
Were they on here?

704
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't remember.

705
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,300
Yeah, there we go.

706
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,500
So it's this weird like Target ref.

707
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,100
Situation here.

708
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,900
That's the one.

709
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,900
So this thing.

710
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,700
Going to be Auto boost.

711
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,900
Now we've everyone should be a little bit more same.

712
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,300
So anyway now we should have again the exactly the same functionality

713
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,700
we had before which is all we were really looking for.

714
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,800
And so that's all fine.

715
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,000
And so now what I can do is I can also say well, okay.

716
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,900
Now, some of these things that we're taking the camera before, let's

717
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,700
just take a look at where they all were.

718
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
And again, one of the ways that I like to do that, a lot of times just

719
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,400
kind of go in and say, well, if everyone was accessing

720
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,700
This camera previously.

721
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm just going to go ahead and get rid of that there and now I can see

722
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
everywhere where people were talking about the camera.

723
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,300
So obviously update camera for any movement because he had all the

724
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,600
compiler will error out.

725
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,000
Now all the time when anywhere and we try to access it.

726
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
And so, if we take a look here, what happened?

727
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,300
When we do update camera-friendly movement, really?

728
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,900
This is all talking about the camera.

729
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,700
So, if I just said game camera camera, I wouldn't need the world mode

730
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,100
anymore except for one very specific circumstance.

731
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,700
Right.

732
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,000
So I could go ahead and here and just say like okay everywhere in here

733
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,900
where we were accessing this off the world mode, I'm just going to

734
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,700
access the camera directly now, right?

735
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,500
And that's kind of handy because now and I guess I need to.

736
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,100
There we go.

737
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Fatal error.

738
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,200
All right I wasn't expecting you to fatal error on this because the

739
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,600
only thing we need the world mode for I guess I should go ahead and

740
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,800
change these as well to camera Arrow.

741
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,200
Since instead of camera dot, those will all be are as once the

742
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,400
compiler figures out, it isn't really that fatal, okay?

743
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,900
So the only thing we need the world mode for is that typical floor

744
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,900
height, which again, I think is probably more of a property of the

745
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,400
world.

746
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,200
If anything, I think that's something we're going to want to upgrade

747
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,300
anyway in the world structs and so on.

748
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,300
But if we were to take a look at the world here, where we're looking

749
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,200
at this, I'm gonna just going to put that in here as like typical

750
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,200
Floor height into the world so that we can just kind of access it

751
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,400
there, right?

752
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,400
So, let's take a look as well at

753
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,900
In fact, typical floor height is really just a chunk Tim and M z, if I

754
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,700
remember correctly.

755
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,900
Like, I'm pretty sure, actually, we could just do it where we were

756
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,700
saying, hey, the room, Delta is, you know, a particular size,

757
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,100
whatever.

758
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,000
But what I'm kind of interested in here as well, is looking at this as

759
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,200
a non-relative phenomenon.

760
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
So I'm going to, I'm going to

761
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,300
kind of hand wave that here for a second and just say, like, okay, it

762
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,100
is whatever it is.

763
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,600
Let's go see what see here?

764
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,100
Let's see, what typical floor height, actually is.

765
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,900
It's three.

766
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,500
We go.

767
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,600
And now I think when we look at any of these are other ones that I

768
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,200
want to look at.

769
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,700
No.

770
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,000
No, that's fine.

771
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,800
So all that's pretty much fun.

772
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,400
All right so in here yeah when we are talking about the camera, I'm

773
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,800
just going to pass that in here.

774
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,200
So World mode camera.

775
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm going to pass that in will change the world mode camera to this

776
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
and off we go.

777
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,700
When we do the update camera entity for Canada movement, I want to

778
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,800
push that camera first.

779
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,900
Incest thing the operating on there, and there we go.

780
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,200
Alright, so what

781
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,000
I wanted to say about this room, Delta stuff is one of the things that

782
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,200
I definitely don't like about how we're doing this at the moment now,

783
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,600
that we're sort of in the camera world and I think when we move to 3D

784
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,900
this would be, also a very good time to think about that.

785
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,800
Is if we wanted to have.

786
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,000
Multiple size rooms in the game, right?

787
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,600
So imagine wanting to sort of have maybe a double length room or

788
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,500
something like, you know, twice that was twice as wide or high as

789
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,800
another room and you wanted the game to pull out.

790
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:26,000
So, it kind of like the camera went up higher and showed you more of

791
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,600
the world.

792
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,000
When you were in that room, that's a pretty reasonable thing.

793
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,500
I want to do right.

794
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,200
You know, there's nothing and there's nothing in the engine that would

795
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,500
really prevent us from doing that.

796
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,200
But right now, we kind of have this hard-coded notion that the rooms

797
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,300
are the size that they are as far as the camera is concerned.

798
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,300
So, that becomes sort of problematic.

799
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,300
And so I think we need

800
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,600
Kind of going forward, is the ability here to say, well where am I in

801
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
the world?

802
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,500
What room am I looking at?

803
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Because I feel like the a room, as a concept kind of needs to be baked

804
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:07,800
in.

805
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,500
Now where a room is you know, it doesn't affect any any entity stuff

806
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,500
or anything like that, but it would need to just sort of be a nice

807
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,100
little

808
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,600
It would have to be something that just sort of said, hey here is like

809
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:33,400
a bounding box that says this is a room as far as this area of the

810
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,300
world is concerned and this is the room you're in at the moment,

811
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,700
right?

812
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,300
And if we look at how room Delta works here, we wouldn't really need

813
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,600
to do any of this stuff.

814
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
The way that we're doing it either.

815
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,900
What we could do instead is

816
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Just say when we have decided we're moving from one room to another or

817
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,600
whatever room.

818
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:01,700
The hero is in, we can just say, oh well, whatever room the hero is

819
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:06,000
in, let's move the camera towards that position, right?

820
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,000
And that's a sort of a, you know, much more sort of straightforward

821
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,900
thing that we that we might want to do there, right.

822
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,600
Hopefully.

823
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,300
All right.

824
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,200
So, you know, that's a thing.

825
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,600
I think we want to probably get two and maybe we'll do that with the

826
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,500
3D thing.

827
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,400
I'll put that in the to do here.

828
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,500
Let's let's take a look.

829
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,100
So we'll call that 3D, you know.

830
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So something like that.

831
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,600
Basically.

832
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Okay, so now we've got our, you know.

833
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,400
Now, we've got our fairly basic stuff happening.

834
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,300
We're we're, you know, we're doing our simulation work and we have

835
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,200
pulled out almost everything from it that we don't think needs to be

836
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:23,600
there.

837
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,600
And so, let's see here, we've got the camera stuff, pulled out this

838
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,900
stuff, I think again, look, I'm pushing down a little bit.

839
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,900
And we did exactly this, we eliminated World mode from The Sims step

840
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
entirely, they're all that.

841
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,100
Well, that's not actually true.

842
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,600
So we still have in simulate that still happens.

843
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,800
So we're not quite done with that yet.

844
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,300
That's we're not, we're not quite there yet.

845
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,000
So let's take a look at what's happening in simulate there, for the

846
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,800
world mode.

847
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:01,900
So let's see.

848
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,900
We're in the same region.

849
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,100
Where is our simulate call?

850
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,000
See

851
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:17,200
So right now we're doing is we're doing brains and let's see typical

852
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,900
floor Heights being passed through here.

853
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,900
The typical floor height gets passed around a lot to say the least.

854
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:25,900
All right.

855
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,700
So anyway, let's take a look at when World Nuggets past.

856
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,800
It looks like World mode isn't really used for very much at the moment

857
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,600
actually.

858
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,600
That's interesting.

859
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,700
So really it's just the entropy and the floor height that's all that

860
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,600
it's used for and then it would be gone entirely.

861
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,400
That's pretty great actually.

862
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,500
All right.

863
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,000
Well, let's go ahead and finish that up.

864
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,500
Then it's further along than I thought it was.

865
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,100
Say the least.

866
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,600
So we're getting there.

867
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,600
That's good.

868
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,100
Good news.

869
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,400
All right, so let's get rid of that.

870
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,200
And now we can basically just say like okay,

871
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,500
All that stuff goes away.

872
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,800
Okay.

873
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,400
so looking at World mode now, it also looks like Okay so

874
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,800
Let's see, simulates taking it.

875
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,800
Let's let's let's let's keep pushing this a little bit further right?

876
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,100
Because here you can see a fairly concise version of this.

877
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah, so let's take a let's take a little bit closer.

878
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,700
Look at this.

879
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,300
And let's see.

880
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,200
You can rip two, worlds, worlds.

881
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,900
So, let's take a look and see if we can't push that a little bit

882
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,200
further because it looks like it's almost there actually at the

883
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,900
moment.

884
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,900
So I'm going to come in here to sim region.

885
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:33,200
I want to take a look at begin Sim or sorry, begin World change and I

886
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,500
just want to see so that doesn't take the world mode yet at all.

887
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,100
So that's good and if I look at begin World change, I'm sorry if I

888
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,000
look at begins.

889
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,200
What does that actually need the world mode for?

890
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:56,800
Yeah.

891
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,100
So that's really it's really just for updating the camera.

892
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,900
Or rather looking at the Delta, you know, the camera Delta that needs

893
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:12,600
to happen there.

894
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,800
I'm kind of interested as to why that's still happening where it's

895
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,700
happening right?

896
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:23,600
Like why that's happening inside begin Sim because again that's really

897
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,700
not something that probably needs to be happening there.

898
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,900
Like I don't know that the camera P needs to be computed there

899
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,200
anymore, right?

900
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Because if we take a look at World mode here and we look at where

901
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,100
we're actually

902
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,100
Using that.

903
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,300
Let's take a look.

904
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,500
And we say, OK, simulate world's mode camera.

905
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,300
Let's see.

906
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,000
And do some here camera.

907
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,700
P is just not used, right?

908
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:59,200
So it's only the case, where we actually care about it.

909
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,700
We only care about that case in here, right?

910
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:10,000
So I think that's probably something where that's actually not what we

911
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
want to be doing.

912
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,300
Yeah, pretty pretty much at.

913
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,400
All right?

914
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,400
So when we call do World Sim here,

915
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,900
And we call begins him.

916
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,100
It's just using the world mode to get that camera for no reason.

917
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,100
So yeah I can verify that that's just yet.

918
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:43,200
Again this is exactly why I want to go through and remove these

919
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,700
dependencies is because you know, there's a lot of stuff in here that

920
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,100
just doesn't really need to be happening in most of the paths, right?

921
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,900
So I think this circumstance is really, you know,

922
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,900
This stuff really only wants to happen on this path.

923
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,800
Pretty much it.

924
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,100
The only time that must happen, right?

925
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
So World mode camera p.

926
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,500
In this case, that stuff wants to happen in here as the way that it

927
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:13,100
would tell it how it was going to do like, essentially where the

928
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,100
simulation was going to take place, if you will would be passed in

929
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,800
like this.

930
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,400
And then in the case where you were actually updating that camera P,

931
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,900
it would come in here where you do the subtraction at the end of

932
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,000
things, right?

933
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,100
I think that's how you would want to do it and so whatever that Sim

934
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:36,500
that previous, mm Centre was that would be, I guess coming in here?

935
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,400
Let's take a look at that.

936
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,600
So here's the Sim Center.

937
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,400
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

938
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,800
We, it's still just the same.

939
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,500
It's not even gonna get updated by that.

940
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,400
So really, it's just saying,

941
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,500
I'm not even sure because these two are the same value, right?

942
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,500
I mean, am I missing something here?

943
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:06,300
Because the Sim Center me, just let me just verify to myself that.

944
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm not delusional about that because it sure does seem that way.

945
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,500
So we take a look here.

946
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,700
We say here's the Sim Center P, right?

947
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,500
It's the same as the camera P.

948
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,900
So in this case, we're going to do that subtraction there.

949
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,300
Well, that's subtraction.

950
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,000
Is we now know completely useless, right?

951
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,100
Anything that's going to be, an offset is going to be in here.

952
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,100
So essentially, it's just that

953
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:36,400
Right?

954
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,800
Nothing needs to happen.

955
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,800
And presumably, that's it, right?

956
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,000
So if I want to, I could just start using the camera here, exactly

957
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,600
this way.

958
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,100
And, you know, go out of here and still works right, and I don't think

959
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,700
there's anything particularly weird going on there.

960
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,600
So really, that is not necessary at all.

961
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
So, if we take a look at the world mode stuff here again, that's just

962
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,900
really, this could just be

963
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,900
Passing down the world and this is not necessary at all.

964
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:11,400
So, the Sim Center and the simulation bounds.

965
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,400
I'm not even sure why we have both of those because presumably the Sim

966
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,100
Center always has to be the same as the Sim bounds, right?

967
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,500
You wouldn't be like what does that even do at this point, right?

968
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,200
It just seems like something that's probably at this point.

969
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,900
A Vestige will remain.

970
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,600
So if we take a look at begin,

971
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,200
World change and I look at the world position origin, right?

972
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:38,400
Yeah.

973
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,900
So that's all that's doing is it's just there to say like okay this is

974
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,900
the center point around which the simulation will occur and this is

975
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,300
the yeah.

976
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,700
So really we don't need to pass that world mode at all.

977
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,900
All we need to do is have somebody pass in that Sim Center.

978
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,500
So we know where we are.

979
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,800
Simulating that combined with

980
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Rectangle would give us that and this doesn't need to be here at.

981
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,400
All right.

982
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:10,100
I guess I should just verify that that's yeah just remember what that

983
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,100
is that this is the region.

984
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,800
We want to be simulating in that case so I'll go ahead and grab that.

985
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,900
Where's that right here?

986
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,600
So when we are going to call begin Sim all will do is say hey we want

987
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,800
to begin some, we want to begin some right there.

988
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,300
And then when I come back up here and take a look at

989
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,500
What we're doing in the other case where we do begin some with the

990
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:48,700
same bounds again that in this case we now need someplace.

991
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,400
How are we doing our Sim bands here?

992
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,400
We do Works in Balance.

993
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,600
So all this should probably just come from the work structure so we'd

994
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,300
probably be wanting to do.

995
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:06,300
Oops, we probably want to be doing something like work Sim Center P

996
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,600
where that's

997
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,900
I think that would sort of be passed down.

998
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:10,600
Okay.

999
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,800
And so in this case we'd say what are the Sim bands and

1000
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,700
What's the Sim Center?

1001
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,900
If I take a look at where we're actually doing that stuff.

1002
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,200
In fact, previously we were sort of doing this offset directly this

1003
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,100
way, which is not stable.

1004
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,900
Floating-point why?

1005
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,600
It's like we couldn't get arbitrarily large with that, right?

1006
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,300
That's the whole reason.

1007
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,700
We have our concept of the separate center staff.

1008
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,300
So, at that point, we want to say, okay, let's do some Center P here.

1009
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,400
And we would want to do something where this actually gets baked in.

1010
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,100
So, there is no offset here.

1011
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,300
The same bounds are just the same bands as they are, right?

1012
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:05,300
And what we want to do here is use the actual World coordinate system,

1013
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,800
to just put the chunk, use the use, the trunk offsets, right?

1014
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,100
So all we would want to do here is say like, okay, we've got a world

1015
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,900
position and like, again, we're doing this fairly arbitrarily, because

1016
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,200
we don't, we're just testing.

1017
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,200
But here's our Center Point.

1018
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,700
And we want a chunk x a chunk.

1019
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:28,300
Why in a chunk?

1020
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:28,800
See.

1021
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:33,900
Well, we wanted those relative I guess to the camera was previously,

1022
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,300
how we were doing it, I believe.

1023
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,400
And so let's go ahead and say whatever that camera was.

1024
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,900
So we've got the world mode camera p.

1025
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,300
is where it'll be and then, we'll just say, like okay, the chunk X,

1026
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
And the chunk, why?

1027
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,800
we'll just offset these and you know, I don't know by who

1028
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,500
Much may be negative 10 or something.

1029
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:08,000
In each Direction, maybe -15 chunks or something like this seems

1030
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,400
relatively straightforward and yeah, there we go.

1031
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,500
And now we just want to multiply that by yeah.

1032
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,500
By our Loop.

1033
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,500
And now we've done the offset in a way, that's, you know, floating

1034
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,700
Point say, for however, big we want to do it as well.

1035
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,000
Not that we care about that, for this particular circumstance, but

1036
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,600
it's just good to know that, that's what we're doing.

1037
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,800
Maybe these should be further away, I don't know, who knows how far

1038
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,800
out they should be if we wanted to be roughly similar what we were

1039
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,300
doing 100 100 before.

1040
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:51,100
So you know, if we want to take a look at what the default chunk size

1041
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,800
is I think alike if it's 100.

1042
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,400
Take a look here.

1043
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,900
I don't remember what.

1044
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,900
Where we actually allocate the world, but let's see.

1045
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,600
So if we're talking about are chunks, being like 1.4 by 1.4.

1046
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,900
So if we wanted a hundred of those, right?

1047
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,900
We're talking about see, something like

1048
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,700
Seventy.

1049
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,200
So, do something like that.

1050
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:47,400
And that's really all there is to that and now we can sort of finished

1051
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,600
up that clean up, right?

1052
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:53,800
We also don't need to pass the camera P back in this result at all.

1053
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,000
It's got the same region in the Sim memory thing the past back.

1054
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,300
We don't need these anymore so that's nice.

1055
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,100
And then we can compile this.

1056
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:01,700
Let's see

1057
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,100
Getting there.

1058
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,000
All right, so let's finish this up.

1059
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,400
When we do update and render entities, let's see, we're passing down

1060
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
the camera P there.

1061
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,200
So that, that camera p is really just again.

1062
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,800
All that was was just the Sim Center, the piece of the Sim Center

1063
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,000
information that we had there.

1064
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Which which we don't really want, right?

1065
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,300
I mean it was, it was

1066
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,200
See her, if I can.

1067
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,300
Put that back.

1068
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,900
It was really just the offset was pretty much all it was.

1069
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,500
I think let me just double-check that that's true.

1070
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,500
Yeah, so I think that's really just it's all it is, is the offset.

1071
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,100
And so when you're talking about update and render entities, you're

1072
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,300
just talking about whatever the offset is.

1073
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,600
When you want to actually render.

1074
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,800
And so I feel like that's something that we would just pass down here

1075
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,800
and that's just the camera off set.

1076
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,500
It doesn't need to get passed through in that weird.

1077
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,100
Kind of way.

1078
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,400
It was just like, overcomplicating how that piece of the program was

1079
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:17,900
working.

1080
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,100
So we should be able to hearsay or we do the simulation.

1081
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,300
We're going to do the rendering assuming that we do have the

1082
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:23,800
rendering.

1083
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:28,100
We just have like camera set as a thing, we passed down and then

1084
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,800
camera offset can just be passed.

1085
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,900
And through directly, right?

1086
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,700
And I think that's pretty much all there is to that.

1087
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,300
I don't think there's anything else to it.

1088
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,200
All right, so let's keep working that through and see if we're right.

1089
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,500
Let's see here.

1090
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:50,000
yeah, in simulate again, we don't care about this because we're not

1091
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,600
rendering

1092
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,900
Inside begin Sim same situation here.

1093
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,100
We just want to pass the world's past the world.

1094
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,300
Not sure why we're passing the camera P to check for joining players.

1095
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,200
That seems real weird.

1096
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,700
That seems really strange because this is the camera off set.

1097
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,800
Which I don't think is what we actually wanted to pass here.

1098
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,100
That makes no sense whatsoever.

1099
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,300
Yeah, so that makes no sense whatsoever because that's like only

1100
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,300
moving when we move in between scenes.

1101
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,700
So I think that was probably a holdover from other stuff.

1102
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,200
I don't think we care about that at all.

1103
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,100
It's only the offset.

1104
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:54,700
So this, if we literally just past the zero point, that would just get

1105
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,800
us the closest thing to the center of the simulation region, which is

1106
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,100
all we really care about there.

1107
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,500
So I don't even think we need that.

1108
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,800
In simulate, we do want to pass the camera offset, which is here.

1109
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,900
Particle systems.

1110
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,000
Want the exact same thing.

1111
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:22,500
Oops.

1112
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,700
And yeah.

1113
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,200
Fink.

1114
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:48,200
That's all there is, don't quote me on that but I think that's all

1115
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:48,600
there is.

1116
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,000
I would say I'm a little suspicious there.

1117
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,800
I was

1118
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,900
Just happened.

1119
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,200
That was a little odd.

1120
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,000
Everything appears to be working properly, but I am a little bit

1121
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,400
weirded out by the fact that the game is running faster for no reason.

1122
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So that's

1123
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,500
you never really wanted that to happen.

1124
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,000
I mean, hey, it's better than the game running slower for no reason.

1125
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,200
But, yeah, that was a little surprising.

1126
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,800
I'm not sure exactly what happened there.

1127
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,000
That's not great, should probably investigate that a little bit

1128
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,900
further in a second when I'm done cleaning this up.

1129
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:42,200
But so okay, again, moving sort of slowly forwards here.

1130
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,200
So now when we look at what is happening with the world mode, we're

1131
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,200
really only talking about

1132
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,700
Happening inside simulate and inside simulate.

1133
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:59,600
We're just looking at passing some really basic stuff through, you

1134
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:05,000
know, basically, we're passing extraordinarily basic stuff from the

1135
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,900
world mode and there's really no need for it to really be there

1136
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,300
anymore.

1137
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,500
I wouldn't think now.

1138
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,800
I don't know, I guess these don't need the world anymore, they don't

1139
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,800
need access to the world, which is what we want because it's just as

1140
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,000
the pull in pull out.

1141
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,400
So really all we need to do here is we need the

1142
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:27,300
The brains need to get their entropy from somewhere, right?

1143
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:33,200
So we need to have some notion of what that entropy value should be

1144
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,000
for them to access Randomness.

1145
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,400
Essentially and I'm not sure where the best place to get that from is,

1146
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,700
but

1147
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,800
I guess what I would say on that fact is

1148
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,400
because multiple people are accessing that entropy at the same time.

1149
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,200
Potentially I don't really know.

1150
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,700
I don't know if we want to take steps to make that entropy be more

1151
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,500
friendly for multi-threading like because it's just something that

1152
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,200
does a mathematical update.

1153
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,400
I don't know that it actually ever matters if two threads romp on it

1154
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,100
at the same time and replace the value.

1155
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:22,500
That one of the other was trying to use, I don't know that that really

1156
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,200
ever matters.

1157
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,300
So it's probably fine that we just don't as weird as that seems.

1158
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,800
But I don't know, right?

1159
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,300
So that's a little bit questionable, you know another way.

1160
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,200
Look at it would be that every thread should use a separate entry

1161
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,900
stream so that you don't ever update have two people updating the

1162
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,300
entropy at the same time.

1163
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,400
But again I'm not really sure I can think of a real reason why you

1164
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,400
care about that.

1165
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:52,700
That may just be isolating something for no real reason.

1166
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,300
Yeah, that's a tough question.

1167
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,300
I can't think of any real reason why.

1168
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,000
So yeah, so this stuff doesn't actually need the world.

1169
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,600
The typical floor height here is one thing that we do need again.

1170
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,600
I'm not sure exactly how we want to handle that.

1171
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,500
Let me take a look again.

1172
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,800
What that's being used for.

1173
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,900
We put that back in temporarily so I can take a look.

1174
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,200
Okay, so yeah, so let's take a look.

1175
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,300
If we go out to the update and render entities,

1176
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,700
I want to look at what the typical fluorides being used for.

1177
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,700
I'm pretty sure it's just used for sorting people into which floor

1178
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,800
they're on, and that does seem to be the case.

1179
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:53,600
Yeah.

1180
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,500
So again, I'm not sure that we actually necessarily need that.

1181
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,300
I mean we can do distance-based fog without that.

1182
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,900
There's a lot of different things we can do if we want that to, you

1183
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,200
know, if we want that to be a thing.

1184
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,800
So I'm not sure, I'm not sure what we want to do.

1185
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,500
They're passing it down.

1186
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,300
Like we do here is obviously totally fine and we could just make it.

1187
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,100
So we pass it through simulated as well.

1188
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,700
Because obviously, anyone who's calling that needs to know.

1189
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,300
The world structure as well which means you know we could just pass it

1190
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,000
here directly.

1191
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,900
So I'm going to Bubble it up for now like just to see what happens if

1192
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,700
we say typical floor of light here and this is not how I want to do it

1193
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,200
eventually but I'm just going to do it this way.

1194
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:52,100
Temporarily is a typical floor height and then I have you know the

1195
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,000
game entered get passed down so that we're literally just passing the

1196
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,400
things we need specifically rather than grabbing them out of stuff.

1197
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,800
If we end up like that, I want to take a look at what that

1198
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:08,700
Entail, when we call simulate here, obviously we can do World typical

1199
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:09,600
floor height.

1200
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,000
And then we need a way to get that entropy and again, that would still

1201
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,200
require I think the world mode, right?

1202
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:31,000
Well.

1203
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,300
In here, same deal, right?

1204
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:51,600
And so we've doubled it up, one level and so these are getting

1205
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,500
slightly better but they're still, you know, pretty, it's still pretty

1206
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,000
questionable at the higher level.

1207
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,800
That those things would actually be necessary if we take a look at

1208
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,800
Going on here.

1209
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,600
We started to get this into a pretty respectable state.

1210
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,100
In terms of what's going on.

1211
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,300
We've got our begins to ma Ren Sim and are stimulates depth and

1212
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,600
they're getting relatively clean.

1213
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:13,100
You will note though.

1214
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:17,300
However, that executes brain still uses game state for stuff, it would

1215
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:21,100
be nice to get rid of the game State, because passing the game safe

1216
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:22,399
down here is not probably.

1217
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:26,600
So we want to do, if you remember how that's working at the moment.

1218
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,000
You can see that the reason that that's there is because it needs to

1219
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,500
access the actual controller information that's happening.

1220
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,700
When, you know, when the game gets input, I think there are ways we

1221
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,600
might want to do that.

1222
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,200
That would not involve this right but

1223
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,200
As always, it's kind of a little bit it's kind of a little bit iffy so

1224
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,800
trying to think of where I want to go with it from here.

1225
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,800
I don't know how much time I've got left.

1226
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I think I've got about 12 15.

1227
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,300
I don't know how long I've got.

1228
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,500
So we started at 10:30, right.

1229
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,900
So I've got 12:15 12:30.

1230
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:14,900
I got to, I've got to about 12:30, I think either that or 12:15.

1231
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,000
I can't quite remember.

1232
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,500
But let's say 1234 now.

1233
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,500
And I need more water.

1234
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,800
So I think what I might want to do is start hammering on the game,

1235
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,100
State side of things, but then there's again, I kind of think that

1236
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,600
game entropy thing is kind of a little bit of an open question because

1237
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,500
I'm not sure, you know, if that because that's more of a world.

1238
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,100
Same thing.

1239
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,300
I'm wondering if that be Long's more in the actual World itself.

1240
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:46,500
You know, I'm wondering, if that's something that wants to belong in

1241
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,500
here, potentially?

1242
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,200
It's really difficult for me to make a guess about that at the moment.

1243
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,200
if you look at like the world made stuff and you just look at the

1244
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,400
constants that are in here,

1245
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,300
Hard to say hard to say.

1246
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,200
Mmm-hmm.

1247
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,900
What is time?

1248
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:18,400
So yeah, looking at this sort of stuff, like we've got the particle

1249
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,000
effects in there, you got the effects, entropy the particles are

1250
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
using, we've got the game entropy.

1251
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,300
Yeah and so looking at this world mode,

1252
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,300
Looking at this world mode.

1253
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,100
And by the way, as far as this to do is concerned having a separate

1254
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,800
camera struct as a good way to start that process.

1255
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,100
If we did want to do that because if you play split screen, we

1256
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,800
duplicate and have two cameras trucks, right, cameras truck per

1257
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,500
player, that sort of thing.

1258
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,900
So I guess what I would say here is yeah like you know, I've got the

1259
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:08,400
world.

1260
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,800
I've got the camera in here that makes sense.

1261
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:15,600
I've got the, you know, standard room dimensions stuff that doesn't

1262
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,200
make sense.

1263
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,900
I feel like that wants to move into the world.

1264
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,600
The world should.

1265
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,500
You should really query the world and get those pieces of information

1266
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,500
based on your location particle.

1267
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,600
Cash, does make perfect sense in here.

1268
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't know that last use.

1269
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,900
Entity storage index should be there.

1270
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,200
That seems like that should definitely be on the world.

1271
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:40,900
Um because that is what you create entities with, right?

1272
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,200
So yeah, I feel like we've got some thinking to do about where these

1273
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,000
things go.

1274
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,700
The energy is a good question because I don't really know where that

1275
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,300
would go.

1276
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,800
And I don't have a strong opinion about it, right?

1277
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,100
It seems like it's a property of a world itself because it's something

1278
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,100
that, you know, if you were going to save and restore potentially, you

1279
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:09,900
would restore save and restore the entropy, you know, not.

1280
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,400
You know this game really doesn't matter.

1281
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,500
I don't think because we're not trying to have any kind of a

1282
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,800
repeatable thing that goes on but you know, in a game that was

1283
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,500
repeatable if you were trying to do that, then you would clearly want

1284
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,500
that to be with the save.

1285
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,400
Entity data, right?

1286
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,700
So it kind of seems like that's something that should be in the world

1287
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,700
proper.

1288
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,400
Whereas effects entropy would be something that's more with the

1289
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,200
particle cash sort of stuff, right?

1290
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,300
you know, so if I had to say, I would say it look more, you know, like

1291
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,100
It feels like you'd want that in here, right?

1292
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:56,300
It feels like, that's something that would be in here, right?

1293
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,400
Because the world is sort of this thing that stores information and

1294
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,500
there's maybe a little bit of global information, and there's such a

1295
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,700
spatial information, it kind of does seem like that would be the right

1296
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:19,900
thing and I like this is entry that does not affect the gameplay.

1297
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,100
It's why is it called game entropy then?

1298
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,400
Oh sorry there's well I can't read that does affect the airplane.

1299
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,000
All right, good.

1300
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,900
So yeah, let me take a look at where that getting initialized.

1301
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,900
And so, if we wanted to inside here, I guess we could say, when we

1302
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,900
actually create the world for the first time we could initialize that.

1303
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,100
So, and

1304
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,100
you know, if we would go so then

1305
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,100
Every time we were talking about that game, entropy we would be

1306
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,200
talking about it off of the world struct.

1307
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,000
so,

1308
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,600
Really, that's about it.

1309
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,800
And so then again.

1310
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,800
Yeah, and with typical floor height

1311
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,500
I think maybe I just want to start addressing that because it's

1312
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,200
bugging me.

1313
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,100
Let's just do it.

1314
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,800
So standard room dimension in, typical floor height.

1315
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,900
I want to start making those little more systemic.

1316
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,300
So inside the world like what I want to have happen here basically

1317
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,900
because I want you to be able to ask

1318
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,200
what room you're in.

1319
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,900
And then I want you to be able to like

1320
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,500
use the dimensions of that room at that time.

1321
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,300
If that makes sense.

1322
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,400
You can even imagine a allowing rooms of different heights to be

1323
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,700
stacked on top of each other.

1324
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,500
So I'm just trying to think about like if you're going to make this

1325
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:12,800
into a sort of a more robust system, what I want to be able to do is

1326
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,000
when I'm pressing the world.

1327
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,100
I want to be able to get out, Notions of what rooms are that I can

1328
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,200
then use for these purposes.

1329
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:24,700
That previously, I was not that I was doing sort of hacked, right by

1330
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,800
just like saying, well, I kind of know how big a room is, so let's do

1331
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:28,400
this thing.

1332
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,500
So what I'd like to do is say okay, how do we get that room Concept in

1333
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:34,900
here?

1334
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:38,900
And to me, you know, one thing that I'm thinking of sort of here is

1335
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,800
well, what if we just had a room?

1336
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,400
Be like an entity in the world, right?

1337
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,500
So there's just an entity called a room and every time you have a

1338
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,500
room, you have one entity that sort of encompasses that rooms space

1339
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,300
and that's what you actually use, right?

1340
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:03,100
and I feel like this has some attractiveness because to me, that

1341
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:08,400
basically says, well, when we do are like begin simmer in Sim, it

1342
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,900
means we could sort of, you know,

1343
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,100
All of the room entities that we see basically build up that knowledge

1344
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,400
of what the local area is.

1345
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,500
And then, you know, we're kind of done at that point, right?

1346
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:30,500
We now could freely create these rooms wherever and when we exit the

1347
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,700
bounds of one of the rooms whichever room we happen to be in, we would

1348
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:40,100
just then transition to pointing the camera so that it encompasses the

1349
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,000
other room.

1350
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,600
And I feel like that's just a more sane way to do it, you know, then

1351
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,900
constantly having these sort of Notions of what's the, what's the

1352
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,600
height of a floor or something like that?

1353
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,400
Which I don't really care about, you know, the code shouldn't really

1354
01:17:59,400 --> 01:17:59,800
have.

1355
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,100
Worry about things like that.

1356
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,800
I don't know why it would ever be something that's really all that

1357
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,900
necessary to know.

1358
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,400
So I'm just kind of, I'm just kind of curious if that could be the way

1359
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,200
that we would work it out.

1360
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,900
And like I said, I've got I think I've got about 40 minutes if that

1361
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,700
makes sense.

1362
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,500
So yeah, yeah, maybe maybe I'll take a look at that.

1363
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,600
So how would that work?

1364
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,400
If we were going to do that, right?

1365
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:33,800
If I take a look at the end of these struts in here, you know, and I

1366
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:39,100
kind of got any of the types sitting around and I've got, you know,

1367
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:42,000
whatever these things are here and you type stairwell.

1368
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I don't know that we even have stairwells anymore, but if I did say

1369
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,300
that there is any type room and that was just a thing that was going

1370
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,200
to be like a bounding box for room, you know.

1371
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,600
I can obviously create those and maybe I start by just making some of

1372
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,200
those, right?

1373
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,500
So every time I add

1374
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,500
Standard room.

1375
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,700
Which is the call that we have here.

1376
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,300
So we say like okay yeah, you know, ad standard room,

1377
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,400
In addition to making all the entities that comprise the room, you

1378
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:16,500
know.

1379
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:22,400
Maybe it also makes an entity for the room itself, right?

1380
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,900
So I do I don't know what I'm going to do exactly here, but I do like

1381
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,300
kind of a begin and thing.

1382
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,800
Although, to be honest, I don't know that end entity does anything

1383
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,300
anymore.

1384
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,800
Yeah, it doesn't really.

1385
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,800
So really what I want to do here is say okay.

1386
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,700
let's go ahead and and get our entity here into the

1387
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,000
world mode.

1388
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,000
And

1389
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:07,600
and an a

1390
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:19,500
And so, all I really want to do here is say, okay, this entity will

1391
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,800
have a bounding box, that is whatever the rooms shape is effectively,

1392
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,300
right?

1393
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,800
And I can make that be sort of a special case to if I want to.

1394
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,200
I can make it so that room and he's in particular just have room bands

1395
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:34,700
on them.

1396
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:40,000
And that's like, they're only property that they happen have and I

1397
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,600
should be able to construct an entity that therefore you know,

1398
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,700
basically has that what we need, it would be centered about the center

1399
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:52,500
and it would have extents that Encompass the entire size of the room.

1400
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,800
So if we take a look at what that would entail, I guess what we'd want

1401
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,400
to do is say

1402
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,800
well, alright, you

1403
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,900
Here's the chunk position from tab position that we were using to

1404
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:05,700
create that.

1405
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,500
So if I was going to do that, I'd say it's just

1406
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,200
No offsets, that's the actual position, right?

1407
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:17,200
That's where it's going to be.

1408
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:23,400
and,

1409
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,500
All I need to do now is actually give it a room, something the size of

1410
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,900
a room as the as its bounding box, right?

1411
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:35,500
And then that would be what it would need to have.

1412
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:36,900
So

1413
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,200
If I do begin entity.

1414
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,400
And I want to attach something here to it.

1415
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,100
I'm not sure exactly how I want to do that.

1416
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,600
Let's take a look at begin ground identity here.

1417
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,200
You can see that it passed equation, volume, I guess I could just do

1418
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,600
that and pass the Collision volume.

1419
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:57,700
That's the size of a room.

1420
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,000
The thing is, I don't know that I really wanted to be a collision

1421
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:01,500
volume.

1422
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,300
I may want it to just be something more straight for that but for now,

1423
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,700
let's say we'll stick with what we've got.

1424
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,200
So we'll say We'll create a ground identity, and we'll pass it room

1425
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:12,200
key.

1426
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,900
Jim and room Collision will just be something that's the size.

1427
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,800
Because again, I'll just stick with what we're doing.

1428
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,900
Currently one, try to change too many things at once and so

1429
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,600
Here is our simple Collision.

1430
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:40,500
So if I made one of these where I just want to see here makes it look

1431
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,200
rounded Collision.

1432
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,700
Is presumably what I want.

1433
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,200
I don't know if any of these are actually what I want, to be honest.

1434
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,400
Because the grounded Collision.

1435
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:01,200
Is actually centering its Dimensions.

1436
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,200
So that the center point, I think is not where we want it to be right,

1437
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:11,800
because you can see this like dim Z Plus offset, see nonsense, right?

1438
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:15,600
So if I actually did something here where I just said like, okay, make

1439
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,600
simple Collision,

1440
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,200
Then I could say well, alright.

1441
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,000
Then I could say, well, alright, I just want to make this to be

1442
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:37,900
centered around.

1443
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,200
How, how rooms are actually centered.

1444
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,100
And I guess now, I think about it, I guess I don't know how we're

1445
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,700
really considering rooms being centered, may be grounded.

1446
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:49,800
Collision is really the more appropriate way for that, because if all

1447
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,900
the things are standing on that flat plane level, you know, maybe

1448
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,800
that's actually fine.

1449
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,100
So, I don't know.

1450
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,100
We'll start with that and I guess I'll see where it goes.

1451
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,800
So, what I want to

1452
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,900
Here is say well how many you know I know what the standard room

1453
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:03,700
Dimension is, right?

1454
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,600
It's we're saying it's 17 here.

1455
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,200
What's the tile dim is 1.4, right?

1456
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:12,400
So the standard room Dimension we're saying is 17 by 9.

1457
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:23,500
And the tile depth in meters or rather, the room vention here.

1458
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:24,700
Is the typical floor height?

1459
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:25,400
There it is.

1460
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,300
So yeah, so if we take a look at that and just say that's what that

1461
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:31,500
is.

1462
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,700
And what if we just say okay now we're going to say we get rid of that

1463
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,100
standard room Dimension.

1464
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,500
If we do that I'm kind of interested to see like where we can go from

1465
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:40,800
there.

1466
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,000
I also want to know where people use that standard room Dimension at

1467
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:44,300
the moment.

1468
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,400
So I know kind of what I'm going to have to be up against.

1469
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,000
Too much, in terms of changing that over.

1470
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
So it looks like basically the Sim bounds are being set to being the

1471
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,600
standard Rim.

1472
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:58,900
Dimension is how that's working.

1473
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,100
So we were just really want to

1474
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,200
We would want to sort of make that be a more.

1475
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,100
Fundamental concept, right?

1476
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,600
Of just simulating a particular size.

1477
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:18,600
I guess we would maybe do a query for the room that we're at and then

1478
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:24,100
just look one room to each side and not actually and then use those

1479
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,400
bounds without actually ever free.

1480
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,900
Prescribing

1481
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,300
Exactly how big that that would be.

1482
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,400
All right, so for now it doesn't necessarily matter.

1483
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,700
So I'll leave it in but we could probably pull that in a second.

1484
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,700
Okay, so the next thing I need to be able to do here is I'm able to

1485
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,700
see these things, so I know what's going on with those.

1486
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,200
So I think traversals not what I want.

1487
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:54,600
I got turned back on volume rendering, so let's take a look here.

1488
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,100
What is the question?

1489
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:03,200
We have a vanity transform and render group.

1490
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,400
Let's see.

1491
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:10,100
Can actually see all the stuff that's there.

1492
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:17,800
So push wrecked outline is expecting a render Group which we pass it.

1493
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:20,600
Suspecting an entity transform which we also pass.

1494
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:28,500
Its expecting a rectangle, either a V3, which in this case is what

1495
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:28,900
we're passing it.

1496
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:34,000
A V3 and Jim to, and then a V4.

1497
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,800
So it's just the real.

1498
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:36,900
It's the, it's

1499
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,800
This last floating point value here.

1500
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,100
That's the part that we're not passing.

1501
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,900
So let's take a look at what we want to pass for that.

1502
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,900
So that's just the thickness.

1503
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,800
It looks like so we must be passing because it looks like that should

1504
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:52,700
have worked, right?

1505
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,200
there's the

1506
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:59,100
group object, transform.

1507
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,100
There's the offset, there's the dimension.

1508
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:07,900
There's a color and the thickness should have been Auto filled in so

1509
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:08,500
I'm not sure.

1510
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,600
Let's see what it thinks.

1511
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,700
I see that's just needs to be an address of that's it.

1512
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:17,300
All right, so

1513
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,900
If we have our little transforms drawn around us are going to, I'm

1514
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,100
going to pull out so we can see ya.

1515
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:32,100
So what I want to be able to do here eventually right?

1516
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,900
As I want to be able to get to the point where I can see that the room

1517
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:39,700
bounds are actually you know that there's an actual bound around the

1518
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:41,500
room that we're in, right?

1519
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,200
I want to be able to see that and I'm not sure that we then would

1520
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,000
really need the yellow or white bow.

1521
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,400
Here that we were drawing before because those are sort of hacked

1522
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,100
bounds that were just drawing where we thought the room boundaries

1523
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,200
were and so on.

1524
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,000
So let me take a quick look at that as well.

1525
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:06,000
That's inside World mode here where we just kind of draw.

1526
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,300
Here we go.

1527
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:09,600
Where we've got like, okay, push worked out line, right?

1528
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,400
Where we're drawing that stuff in here we draw.

1529
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,200
What do we draw?

1530
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:19,300
We're drawing the screen bounds, the simulation bounds, and the Sim

1531
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,000
region back.

1532
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:20,700
Bounds.

1533
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,100
I don't know that those two are really all that different.

1534
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:29,500
I guess, we previously did have them be different but nowadays,

1535
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:30,300
they're kind of not.

1536
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:31,800
All right.

1537
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,300
So,

1538
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,700
I guess I'm not sure what we even care about the screen Vans anymore

1539
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,200
for

1540
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,700
I guess it's just because that's what we were using for simulation

1541
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,200
previously, but

1542
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,200
yeah, that's

1543
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,200
It's really not even something that we really use anymore, right?

1544
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,000
So, it's handy thing to draw, just so we know that we're still

1545
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,800
Computing it properly, but again, you're not really using it for much.

1546
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:14,700
Okay, so if we want to draw now the if we want to put in entities that

1547
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,800
are the shape of rooms.

1548
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,500
What we want to be able to do is sort of see.

1549
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:25,300
We want to be able to see clearly what those outlines are.

1550
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:29,400
So, what I might do here is I might go ahead and say, let's take out

1551
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:35,800
the trees for a moment and, you know, maybe or we could just maybe

1552
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,900
turn off entity drawing for a second.

1553
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:38,400
So,

1554
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,300
Will actually be able to see a little bit more.

1555
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:41,300
Clearly, what's going on?

1556
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:45,700
If I were to put in an outline there, if I want to do that.

1557
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,400
all I would have to do here is just

1558
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,400
Stop any?

1559
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:59,700
Stop any usage of the, the actual pieces.

1560
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:04,600
And so here we can see, we're sort of more abstract, Lee, what's going

1561
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,300
on, right?

1562
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:12,600
And there we go.

1563
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,400
So what I want to do yet again and maybe I'll have to turn off even a

1564
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,100
little bit more of the stuff that we're drawing here just to make sure

1565
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,200
we could still see it.

1566
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:28,600
Because it's going to roughly fit exactly that bound.

1567
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,200
So I might turn up a couple more things in order to see it, but so

1568
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,000
let's go ahead and temporarily turn these off as well.

1569
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:51,600
And well, I'm still getting the white region there, so I actually want

1570
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,100
that.

1571
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:52,600
I think

1572
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:04,700
Okay, so here, we've got just rectangles drawing, and I guess the

1573
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,400
particle systems are still there.

1574
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,500
The little test particles.

1575
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,100
We do wonder why our particles, we sort of turned off.

1576
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:13,900
Some of the

1577
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,100
The updating here, right?

1578
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:27,100
Why did?

1579
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,600
When did when did that happen?

1580
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,400
Our particles.

1581
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:32,300
No longer we turned off a bunch of stuff for our particles but I don't

1582
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,500
remember what we turned off.

1583
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,200
Exactly.

1584
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,700
I think we turned off like the upward velocity of them, perhaps.

1585
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,500
I can't quite remember.

1586
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:55,700
Here's the actual.

1587
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,900
May the protocol forward in time if he was famous basement.

1588
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,500
So it looks like we were just trying to isolate

1589
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:19,400
what was happening so we probably just did that, right?

1590
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:25,900
There we go.

1591
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,900
Not sure why if we wanted to do that right now, but I just like, I

1592
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:35,700
forgot we never turned our particle like sort of push back on.

1593
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,200
Who knows why?

1594
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,600
Alright, anyway, point being

1595
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:47,900
I want to now be able to see these rooms so that I can verify that

1596
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:49,900
they're getting created in the same place in the right place.

1597
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:54,600
So every time we do add standard room, what I want to do is figure out

1598
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,100
a way that I can add an itty here and that entity will sort of

1599
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:04,700
Encompass, the shape that the room actually is.

1600
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,700
So all I really need to do.

1601
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,100
I think there is set the type of the room to be inanity.

1602
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:12,700
Does that make sense?

1603
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,500
Where is that actually set?

1604
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,700
Of course, the other thing.

1605
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,700
Oh, so do we actually eliminate the entity types entirely?

1606
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:34,600
So, I think we would actually just need to have this be sort of a

1607
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,800
separate concept that's case.

1608
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,900
Like I these gone now.

1609
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:46,700
Yeah, so we need some way of knowing that this is a room.

1610
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,900
Well I guess we don't really even need a way of knowing it's room.

1611
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:50,800
We just need at the moment.

1612
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,600
We just need to actually be created there that I need to actually be

1613
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,300
able to see that.

1614
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,600
It's that, it's, that it's sitting there.

1615
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:02,500
So in theory, that should be creating it, but I'm not 100% sure that I

1616
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:03,200
can actually see it.

1617
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:07,000
Now, of course, again, it may be, that it's just kidding behind those

1618
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:07,200
things.

1619
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:11,400
So, I kind of need to be able to turn off, even more to be able to be

1620
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:11,900
sure that I can.

1621
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:12,500
It.

1622
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:16,000
So if I kind of go into entity and also turn off rendering

1623
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,400
traversable, 's maybe that would give me enough.

1624
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,100
I'm not sure that it would though.

1625
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,000
Well, let's see.

1626
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,300
right because we can't really even still tell, you know, it'd be

1627
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:46,800
really hard to see whether there's there's entity kind of going

1628
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:51,700
On behind there, if it was just between, would just be getting

1629
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,000
overdrawn potentially.

1630
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:56,700
So I need some way of being able to peek back behind there.

1631
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,900
And I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to do that.

1632
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,200
You know it looks like it's there, right?

1633
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:17,700
Because it looks like that's the boundary and I have it selected at

1634
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:20,900
the moment, but I don't actually know, right?

1635
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,800
So I think that is actually getting creating the right place but I

1636
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,500
would like a better way of doing that.

1637
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,000
I suppose one way to do that, would just be to turn off the trees

1638
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:29,700
entirely.

1639
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,700
Let's take a look.

1640
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,600
so Inside Out standard room, when I'm actually adding the

1641
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,600
Walls.

1642
01:35:59,600 --> 01:35:59,800
I'm just,

1643
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:00,700
I'm just going to not.

1644
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,200
Okay.

1645
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,700
So yeah, so it is there.

1646
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:13,300
Now, I can actually see it and if I go ahead and move out, let's see

1647
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:13,600
here.

1648
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:23,900
So yeah, it looks like that actually does work.

1649
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,900
Just fine and those rooms are now being created, so I can actually

1650
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:31,100
look and verify that that's actually true.

1651
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,000
However, like I was saying before.

1652
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,700
Okay, so we do still have a problem now, which is that we don't really

1653
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,700
have, however, any

1654
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:47,300
We don't really have any concept, though that rooms are special in

1655
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:47,900
that way.

1656
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:53,700
And so I'm not sure what we want to do about that, right?

1657
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,700
So let's let's take a minute and think about that, I can turn off the

1658
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,200
volume stuff here.

1659
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,600
One way to do that.

1660
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,100
Is to just end.

1661
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:13,800
In fact, I guess now, I think about this kind of interesting.

1662
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:21,300
One way to do that, would to be to, you know, sort of use brains for

1663
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:21,900
this purpose.

1664
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,900
So we can basically say, like okay, walls are all participating in a

1665
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:25,900
particular brain type.

1666
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:30,200
So every time you get a wallet gets added into a brain slot.

1667
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:32,300
I'm not sure I remember.

1668
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:43,100
In fact I don't think we do that would do some interesting things with

1669
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,300
bringing that would create like a brain limit.

1670
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,600
I guess what I'm saying is here.

1671
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,100
So we have brain types, right?

1672
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,900
And brain types are just the things that it's like, which AI

1673
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,700
controller you want on your thing.

1674
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:07,800
And so, you can imagine reusing that effectively for doing the gather

1675
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:09,700
for rooms, right?

1676
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,600
It's sort of like a brain for the camera, if that makes sense.

1677
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,200
So if for example, I said, oh, There Was, You Know,

1678
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,600
A room brain.

1679
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,100
And so anything that was a room.

1680
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:27,400
Got added to the room brain.

1681
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:38,000
In theory that would work, the thing that it creates is it creates a

1682
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,800
dependency here where you're basically saying like, Okay, now the

1683
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:47,100
maximum number of rooms that you can have in a simulation region, is

1684
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,900
proportional to the maximum number of slots in a brain.

1685
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,300
She don't know, is really something you want to do, right?

1686
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,000
And so I'm a little reticent to go that route, even though it is kind

1687
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,300
of convenient and nice.

1688
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:09,100
So it kind of again it feels a little bit like that it wants to be

1689
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:12,500
more of a First-Class citizen that I don't really know, right.

1690
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:19,100
It feels like it wants to be something where the where the world has

1691
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:24,300
more knowledge of what a room is and doesn't have to come at it quite

1692
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,200
so sideways.

1693
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:31,100
And so I do worry a little bit about making it that in line with how

1694
01:39:31,100 --> 01:39:31,600
everything else.

1695
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:36,200
it's got a nice attraction to it in the terms of well it just reuses

1696
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:40,800
stuff that we already have, but I don't necessarily like

1697
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:48,400
I don't necessarily like some of the implications there so I'm not

1698
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,600
really sure that's I find this to be a really tricky one.

1699
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,300
I'm not sure how I want to do that.

1700
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,000
I think it makes a lot of sense for the rooms to be stored as

1701
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,400
entities.

1702
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:07,200
I just don't know if it makes sense to overload, the brain concept for

1703
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,400
them.

1704
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:20,700
So I'm kind of thinking that maybe more what I would prefer there is

1705
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,400
like the simulation region.

1706
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,700
You know, itself.

1707
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:30,200
Keeps a separate list of rooms.

1708
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:36,300
So anytime it on is going to unpack a room, it, you know, is going to

1709
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,200
record that and it's a separate marker.

1710
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:42,900
In the end of the thing that says, you know, this is a room.

1711
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,900
So, let's take a look at what would happen if I did that.

1712
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,900
I'm just curious to know because let's take a look at all the people

1713
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,700
who have to actually deal with this as a thing.

1714
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,100
So, you know, when we're doing update and render entities here, we

1715
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:13,300
sort of do this, this stuff with the, you know, with the typical floor

1716
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:17,100
height and that's used for computing, sort of a like per level.

1717
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,700
Fogging effect that goes on there, that won't have to happen anymore.

1718
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,100
With a z buffer, right?

1719
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:26,600
Because once we have the Z buffer, will be able to just have actual

1720
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:31,200
fog that that goes down with a, you know, in a regular kind of Z

1721
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:31,800
fashion.

1722
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,400
And so I'm not sure that that's really all that necessary.

1723
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,900
So I don't know that anyone in here is actually ever going to Care

1724
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:42,100
again about that particular piece of information, right?

1725
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:45,800
We don't need any look, we were going through extraordinary lengths

1726
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:50,500
here to try and sort entities into floors properly and then have those

1727
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,700
floors, you know, get out.

1728
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:54,200
Outfit separately and all these are sorts things but we don't really

1729
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,500
need to do any of that anymore.

1730
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,700
We can now just do two passes with the Z buffer and be done, right?

1731
01:42:01,700 --> 01:42:05,200
So it's definitely in the kind of thing where I'm like L all right

1732
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:09,500
like you know we can we can face some of this over to the GPU as

1733
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:12,300
something that it has to deal with and then we don't have to really

1734
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,300
deal with it much at all.

1735
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,200
So you know again floors in that sense aren't particularly necessary

1736
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,200
in any way either.

1737
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,100
So it's it feels like it's really mostly about

1738
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,400
The camera is the reason that we actually care, you know.

1739
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,400
And the only person who'd really be caring about it is when we go to

1740
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,700
do that camera update,

1741
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:41,300
So it's kind of like we almost don't need to know it all in a lot of

1742
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,600
cases.

1743
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,700
And that does seem.

1744
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,400
That does seem pretty likely.

1745
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,200
So taking a look at update camera for entity movement here.

1746
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,300
Like, let's imagine what would happen.

1747
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,200
Suppose that we just brute force it, right?

1748
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,800
And then we weren't even doing anything particularly interesting

1749
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:17,100
suppose that we just did a for I Loop here and said, okay let's look

1750
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:23,400
at all the room and two teas that are in this simulation region

1751
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,900
because you can look at what's Happening Here, Right?

1752
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:31,700
You look, your we're looking to see if you're outside of the room.

1753
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,900
You know that you were that you were

1754
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,400
Last in.

1755
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,600
So, you know, you can see here, we're saying, is the entity.

1756
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:44,800
Why outside of whatever that room apron is?

1757
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:48,700
And when it's outside of that, you know, that's when we start that

1758
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,300
that transition, right?

1759
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:59,400
I feel like we could just do looping over the entities and find the

1760
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:03,800
two closest rooms to wherever the entity is, and then just do the

1761
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,800
interpolation that way, right?

1762
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,800
And this would be the only thing that ever actually cared about that.

1763
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:09,900
And

1764
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:14,900
that's pretty compelling to me because then we would literally not

1765
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:16,100
care ever about this.

1766
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:18,200
We wouldn't have to keep them in the brain at all.

1767
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,200
We can still use the brain type for this purpose.

1768
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,700
If we wanted to, but we wouldn't ever have to actually add them to the

1769
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:24,500
brain set.

1770
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:28,000
And we could also, if we want to have an out-of-band place that we

1771
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,800
stored those

1772
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:31,300
So, yeah.

1773
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:36,300
I mean yeah I guess I just think say like let's let's imagine

1774
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:40,900
What this would look like.

1775
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:45,600
So imagine we said there was a type brain

1776
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,100
For room.

1777
01:44:55,900 --> 01:44:59,800
And we say here like hey by the way of these are special types.

1778
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:04,200
Which are used to Mark special entities.

1779
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,700
So let's say we didn't have a particular brain type and that was brain

1780
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,200
type room.

1781
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,500
But when we begin the world change,

1782
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:18,900
And we come through and repressing the entities, instead of actually

1783
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:24,000
creating a brain for this brain, we actually do a test for us to see

1784
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,700
whether or not the brain type.

1785
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:31,100
Well actually the brain value can just be 0 and the Brain type

1786
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:37,300
Will be set to room.

1787
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,400
And that'll just work because it won't try to unpack the brain if the

1788
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,200
value is 0.

1789
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:43,900
Right?

1790
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
So that's perfect, that's exactly what we want.

1791
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,200
So, that's kind of cool, right?

1792
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,500
So that means we can just use this to Mark people, and it's

1793
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:06,600
essentially a free entity typing system.

1794
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:11,500
If we need that for certain special types, I guess, I'll put this down

1795
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:16,700
here and that way I can Mark those but I can still leave the brain

1796
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:17,600
slot as zero.

1797
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:23,800
So for example, in here, when I actually make one of these in add

1798
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:24,700
standard room,

1799
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,200
I can just go ahead and say, well, when I set this entity, I'll just

1800
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,100
go ahead and set the brain slot.

1801
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:41,600
I believe that's just the stuff down here.

1802
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,900
You can see how it's normally done, right?

1803
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:48,300
So if we take a look at this, you can see.

1804
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:56,900
We do brain slot, and I don't actually want any of that stuff to be

1805
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:57,600
happening, right?

1806
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,300
So brain slot, I guess I can just leave it as zero, brain ID,

1807
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:04,800
See here.

1808
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:08,600
I want someone who's going to set that.

1809
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:10,100
How are we setting that before?

1810
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,900
Like the monstars use them, right?

1811
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,000
Yeah it just uses add brain.

1812
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:28,100
Yeah, so that actually works perfectly because then we're doing like,

1813
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,000
okay the brain ID.

1814
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,000
We could just be like

1815
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:37,600
something like special brain ID and then we can just say like, okay,

1816
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,100
let's say what we want, the specific type to be so let's make that

1817
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:51,800
Brain type rim and when we do yeah you can see it.

1818
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,300
We got no brain here, right?

1819
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,200
And when we do that, I could say special brain.

1820
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,000
and I feel like,

1821
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:18,000
I feel like when we do add brain, that's just it right those brains.

1822
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:23,500
Where is it actually getting that type from when it does those, the

1823
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:25,100
brain slot, right?

1824
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,400
So I don't really want the brain ID.

1825
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,900
I just I want the brain slot is the one I actually want.

1826
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:34,600
So this is really a special brain slot is what we're actually looking

1827
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,400
for, right?

1828
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:38,700
Yeah.

1829
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,500
And so when we're talking about the brain,

1830
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,600
They're what I really want to do is say like okay I want a way to get

1831
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:52,800
a special brain slot back which is like special brain slot that and I

1832
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,300
just say brain type that makes sense.

1833
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,600
And it initializes that.

1834
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:13,600
Like so, and so that means even the index would be fair game for us.

1835
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,100
We could set the index to something here.

1836
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:17,600
If we cared about it, we don't really care about it.

1837
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,300
In this case, because we don't have any actual information to store

1838
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,800
there, but you could actually store additional information are if you

1839
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:27,400
wanted to.

1840
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,600
We just don't happen to want to.

1841
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,700
So if I do that,

1842
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:39,700
Brain, touch you, it's okay, it's fine.

1843
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,200
If I do that, I now I shouldn't break the brain system at all, because

1844
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,800
it shouldn't even be getting used.

1845
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,600
It's just kind of stored there as a piece of information that we can

1846
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,500
use as sort of a demarcation, right?

1847
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,900
And so when I take a look at that,

1848
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,600
And I guess there's really not necessarily since we are talking about

1849
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,400
doing a new stuff.

1850
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:07,200
Sparse, We could decide to move that out into a separate variable if

1851
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:08,000
we want to later.

1852
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,400
But for now, we'll just use it that way.

1853
01:50:10,100 --> 01:50:11,200
Inside the same region.

1854
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,000
What I can do is say like okay.

1855
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:17,800
You know, when I'm unpacking these guys, I can say if the destinations

1856
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:22,500
brain slot type is, you know, one of these special types that I care

1857
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,700
about, I can do something different here, right?

1858
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:27,200
I can say,

1859
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,100
When I get one of these, do something with it here.

1860
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:37,200
So if I wanted to keep a separate list of rooms, I could I think I'm

1861
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,200
just going to brute force it at the moment.

1862
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:44,500
I don't know that, that's a great idea but I think I'm going to just

1863
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:47,600
so I don't have to put a constraint on the number of these that there

1864
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:51,100
are at the moment but we may want to

1865
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:56,800
We may not want to do that for all time, right?

1866
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,000
So if I take a look at,

1867
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:06,100
some region when I'm updating the camera here for any movement, I

1868
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,700
guess, what I'm saying is in here, we would just say like okay

1869
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,300
Let's Loop over the entities.

1870
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:28,100
You know, maybe we keep a separate list of those during unpack, so we

1871
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:32,500
can Loop through the rooms separate, you know, as a separate thing.

1872
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:36,400
Probably something we'd want to do, but

1873
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:41,600
What I can do here is say like, all right, when I Loop through all of

1874
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:46,500
these, let's just get the room, whatever the room, the player happens

1875
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:50,700
to be in at that time, let's just get that.

1876
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:56,300
Let's just figure out what that is and and call it a day, right?

1877
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,600
So if I Loop through here and say, like, okay, here's the enemies,

1878
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,800
I'm going to need the stem region here.

1879
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:23,800
and all I want to do is say, well, okay, for all the entities that we

1880
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:24,300
had,

1881
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,200
I'm just going to look and see if I've got any room entities.

1882
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:34,000
And if I do, I guess I just want to look to see is the center of the

1883
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,100
same region inside that room because that would be the determiner of

1884
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:41,400
which room I was technically in at the time I believe, right?

1885
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:42,800
That's that's sort of the

1886
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,200
The determining Factor there, right?

1887
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:52,900
And I guess I don't really remember exactly how we were eventually

1888
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,600
moving the camera per se.

1889
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:59,600
I think it's just once we get past the apron for setting the new

1890
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,900
camera P, right?

1891
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:02,500
So

1892
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:07,600
Yeah, you can see we only really do it.

1893
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,500
If we get past that room, Delta

1894
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:15,300
All right, so the room Delta here.

1895
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:17,300
I guess we have it set to just be

1896
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:24,600
Literally twice, what the or rather?

1897
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,700
What that, actually, I think multiplies out to be.

1898
01:53:26,700 --> 01:53:27,500
Let me just double-check.

1899
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:28,100
That's true.

1900
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:33,200
So, 1 point 4 times 17 2015.

1901
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:38,500
Yeah, so it's a little bit bigger than the current the room.

1902
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,800
Delta is just a little bit off from the actual room size.

1903
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,800
So, if we want to hear, we want to just say, all right.

1904
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:46,900
Let's suppose we were going to compute.

1905
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:50,000
All of these things from the actual information.

1906
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:50,300
We get

1907
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,900
About the room itself.

1908
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,300
So we, you know, we want all of this information, but we want to get

1909
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:57,100
it dynamically.

1910
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,900
So if we take a look at that all of this stuff,

1911
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Is basically dependent information, again.

1912
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,200
I don't think we actually want to do this, after we're done.

1913
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,700
I want to make the camera move a little bit smarter than how it's

1914
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,300
doing right now.

1915
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:13,300
But just for the moment, this room, Delta piece of information here is

1916
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:16,000
really just, it's just the size of the room, right?

1917
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,800
So if we search through here and found a room,

1918
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:25,800
That was the, that was included the Simulation Center, right?

1919
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,400
And remember, I know the Simulation Center because it's 000, right?

1920
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:34,600
It's always the origin of the of the simulation.

1921
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:37,400
We always all things have been mapped into that space.

1922
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:43,300
So if I was to Loop over the Collision region of this thing or and

1923
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:48,700
really I could just even probably use a Point query test here because

1924
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:49,800
we've got say you know

1925
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,700
The overlaps rectangular, right?

1926
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,900
And you can kind of see where we pass Collision volume in a rectangle

1927
01:54:55,900 --> 01:55:00,200
and we look to see whether they those points intersect.

1928
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:04,900
So this is in rectangle, function is exactly what we need for that

1929
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,100
purpose, right?

1930
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,100
And so, that's really all I'm talking about here.

1931
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,400
So, what I would do is I'd Loop through all these entities.

1932
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,600
I say, for every entity, if it happens to be a room type, you know, is

1933
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,500
is 0 in it, right?

1934
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:26,000
If point or entity contains point, right?

1935
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:31,400
And then I just passed the center of the simulation region which is

1936
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:35,500
always 0 0 0, I passed the entity in question.

1937
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,400
And once I figured out whether it contains that point, then I'm done.

1938
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:58,800
Now, I know the room that we're actually in and so I could say room

1939
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,500
In room 0.

1940
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,500
In fact I can move this down here now and I can just say, like okay in

1941
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,600
room equals test,

1942
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:14,700
Once I knew the room that I'm in, then I just need to use the balance

1943
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,700
of that entity to figure that out.

1944
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:25,200
And in fact I could if I want to make that be a property of the actual

1945
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,600
Collision test, it could return which of the rectangles it was

1946
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:30,400
actually in as well.

1947
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,300
And I could just say that information because if you take a look and

1948
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,000
see isn't a rectangle, see

1949
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:41,500
See.

1950
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:56,500
so inside here, I believe we typically have to well

1951
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,700
Okay, so we do have the total volume.

1952
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:06,100
So I guess what we can do is just always use the total volume.

1953
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,000
All right.

1954
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,200
That's fair.

1955
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:12,800
So I guess we could just always say like.

1956
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,000
All right, so the room, Delta itself is just a total volume for this

1957
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,300
entity, right?

1958
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:23,300
So we just say, you know, whatever the in-room total volume is that's

1959
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:27,100
going to be whatever the room, Delta is now mind you at this point, we

1960
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:32,000
also have the problem of, well, we may not have found one and if we

1961
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,700
haven't found one, we probably just want to leave the camera where it

1962
01:57:34,700 --> 01:57:36,000
is, right.

1963
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:38,900
We may also want to just do an assertion on that.

1964
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:43,100
Yeah, we'll see how it goes because probably there isn't a time when

1965
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,200
that should really be happening.

1966
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,700
So when we do this and we Loop through entities, we go.

1967
01:57:48,700 --> 01:57:53,500
We see if we find one, I guess, I can say any overlaps rectangle.

1968
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:58,500
I suppose, we could actually just reuse this function if you wanted

1969
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:58,800
to.

1970
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:00,300
I don't know that I really want to.

1971
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,100
But if we did,

1972
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:04,900
It would just look like this.

1973
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:19,000
I have here, a thing which says here is a volume.

1974
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,600
I want to know if an entity overlaps it.

1975
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:26,100
So I give it the I can just give it the volume, that's a 000 volume.

1976
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:27,700
It's like the null rectangular, right?

1977
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:33,900
It's just whatever the nothingness is, right at the center of the

1978
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,600
simulation region.

1979
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:38,600
If the, if that if the entity region encompasses that then that's

1980
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,100
technically they're right?

1981
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:45,600
again, not really necessary but it's just to reuse this function at

1982
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,800
the moment since, you know,

1983
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:52,000
No, reason not to while we're starting to get things going.

1984
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:03,000
So total volume for entities.

1985
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:05,500
I guess.

1986
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,600
I don't know.

1987
01:59:08,300 --> 01:59:13,300
It has an offset p and a dimension.

1988
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:22,600
I'm kind of interested to double-check that here.

1989
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:29,400
So here's one of the overlaps rectangle and we're checking to see if

1990
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,000
something is inside a rectangle.

1991
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
You can see that it uses the offset P there, right?

1992
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,300
So if I want to do the find the room, Delta I just need the size of

1993
01:59:41,300 --> 01:59:41,900
this thing.

1994
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,600
So all I care about really here is the dimension

1995
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,200
for the time being.

1996
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:52,900
And so this now needs the same region or to do that update step.

1997
02:00:02,900 --> 02:00:04,200
Looks like this comes first.

1998
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:12,100
All right, so I think that's about it and like now we're going to have

1999
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:15,400
to do actually debug this, but I'll probably save that for next dream,

2000
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:16,300
right?

2001
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,400
Because, you know, right here, we should be going outside.

2002
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:23,100
And presumably, that's not getting picked up properly.

2003
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:27,300
Let me double check to see where we're at.

2004
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,200
In terms of that, there we go.

2005
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:39,700
Yeah.

2006
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:42,100
And you can see it's not actually able to find one.

2007
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,900
So let's just do a quick to do this will be a really simple to bug but

2008
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:51,100
we'll save it for next time because I'm going to want to kind of go

2009
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,100
further into this as well at that point.

2010
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,100
And let's go ahead and go to unite.

2011
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,200
Okay, so this is a three-part question 1.

2012
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:46,100
Do you ever work on large multi million lines of code, code bases,

2013
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:50,400
like, Chrome, GCC unreal, etcetera, the full build Dev process.

2014
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,400
You've been using works for small projects, but how do you scale?

2015
02:01:56,500 --> 02:02:01,200
So I guess I would say that that's sort of a

2016
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:08,200
I guess that's sort of a, that is not something I want to do, kind of

2017
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:09,500
a question, right?

2018
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:13,800
So it's like, in my mind, if you have a code base that you cannot

2019
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:20,200
compiled in, you know, 10 20 seconds, then I probably wouldn't work on

2020
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:21,300
that code base, right?

2021
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:27,500
So if you took something like Chrome or GCC or unreal or whatever I

2022
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,800
would just point out, lots of stuff about that, right?

2023
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:33,500
So first of all, if you have something that for some reason actually

2024
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:33,800
does

2025
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,400
Have as much complexity as it would as would require multiple millions

2026
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,600
of lines of codes which by the way, none of those three projects do.

2027
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:48,900
Like I would not consider Chrome or GCC or unreal to necessitate that

2028
02:02:48,900 --> 02:02:49,900
many lines of code.

2029
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:53,800
But let's say, you do have something, which legitimately the problem

2030
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,500
with it, is that it necessitates that many lines of code, not just

2031
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,400
that, there are more lines of code than there should be in the

2032
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,800
project, which is the actual

2033
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,500
I mean a lot of those cases, right?

2034
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:06,100
For example, GCC, you know, there are compilers that are incredibly

2035
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:06,600
tiny.

2036
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,700
So the way I would write a compiler is I'd write one that was much

2037
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:11,200
much smaller than GCC.

2038
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,300
I consider the size of the code to be a actual problem and small code

2039
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:18,200
to be a feature.

2040
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:24,000
So I don't consider it outside the scope of an answer to say that's,

2041
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:28,100
you've you've made a mistake up if you've gotten to that situation,

2042
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:28,500
right?

2043
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:33,200
But let's say you did get into that situation and you're you know,

2044
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:36,800
maybe you're coming on in your you've just been handed you see see and

2045
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,000
you have to use it right?

2046
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I didn't like the very first thing I would do is break it up into

2047
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:48,200
modular pieces that I can build and work on separately, right?

2048
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:53,200
Because if I can't rebuild the whole thing in a reasonable amount of

2049
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:57,200
time, that's a huge, huge, huge problem.

2050
02:03:57,900 --> 02:04:00,500
I would consider that the most important problem to solve on any

2051
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:03,900
project immediately is, if you can't build the whole thing in a

2052
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:04,800
reasonable amount of time.

2053
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:13,400
Because it just it really severely affects the ability of programmers,

2054
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:18,500
to make large-scale changes to the architecture.

2055
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,800
They just can't do it, they won't be able to do it.

2056
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:27,000
If it takes you know 30 minutes for them to see what A change is like

2057
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,800
that, it touches a lot of things.

2058
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:32,500
And so I just don't feel like that's a, that's a

2059
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:37,200
A way to program that that is sustainable.

2060
02:04:40,900 --> 02:04:41,600
So that's what I'd say.

2061
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:44,400
So I would actually turn around and say if I can't build a project

2062
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:47,400
with the unity build, basically right with the ability to just like

2063
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,800
build it all as one build and go.

2064
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:56,800
If that's taking 30 seconds, a minute 10 minutes Heaven, forfend, it's

2065
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:00,700
a half an hour, then that's problem.

2066
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,100
Number one, like that is the thing.

2067
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:04,000
I will be working on until that's not true anymore.

2068
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,300
I would not even dream of touching any other feature of the code base.

2069
02:05:08,500 --> 02:05:10,400
So, I solved that problem, it would be problem.

2070
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:10,900
Number one,

2071
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:13,400
So yeah.

2072
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:19,800
Let's see.

2073
02:05:20,300 --> 02:05:26,800
So / 2 Y is past video archiving disabled just because like I did not

2074
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:32,300
like the fact that those videos were being used because the and and

2075
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:39,700
capped basically like the the on stream like discussion stuff, that's

2076
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:44,000
not part of the official recording is not supposed to be permanent,

2077
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:48,000
you know, it's not supposed to be a thing that that

2078
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,900
Gets archived.

2079
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:55,900
And so I had the twitch replay stuff enabled because you know people

2080
02:05:55,900 --> 02:05:59,200
had been using it that way but then you know, it's gotten to the point

2081
02:05:59,200 --> 02:05:59,800
where people

2082
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,600
Like, saving those, or clipping them out, or doing something that, and

2083
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:04,600
that, that's not the intention of them.

2084
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,600
So, the fact that I couldn't really keep that from happening means

2085
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:10,600
that I just turned it off.

2086
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,400
I mean, in the closet, the back will actually close.

2087
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,600
I know, I'm just happened to be close to the back wall.

2088
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:21,100
Sylvester's too.

2089
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:23,800
I don't know if unrelated questions are allowed, but how do you stay

2090
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:27,200
so focused on your programming and are so efficient.

2091
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:36,500
I guess, I don't know, I don't think I'm particularly efficient.

2092
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,900
I certainly don't feel particularly efficient on stream because

2093
02:06:40,900 --> 02:06:44,400
talking a lot about stuff, kind of slows things down to, I guess I

2094
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:44,900
would say,

2095
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:51,800
you know, don't don't allow yourself to do other things other than

2096
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:54,700
work on the, on your code, on your computer, is a really good way to

2097
02:06:54,700 --> 02:06:55,300
do that, right?

2098
02:06:55,300 --> 02:07:00,000
Like staying focused on things, is kind of about not allowing yourself

2099
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,800
to go.

2100
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:04,700
Do other things while you're while you're essentially working on

2101
02:07:04,700 --> 02:07:09,500
programming and you know that's actually something that amusingly

2102
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,900
enough doing something on a stream actually helps with a little bit

2103
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,500
because if everyone's watching you program, you're not going to go

2104
02:07:15,500 --> 02:07:16,500
like read the internet or

2105
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:17,300
Right?

2106
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Or at least, hopefully not.

2107
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:22,300
So that's, that's one thing that's kind of helpful at work.

2108
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:26,400
Normally I just don't my computer isn't plugged into the internet so

2109
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,200
the only and I don't install anything on it.

2110
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:33,900
So my computer is literally nothing other than a compiler, the

2111
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,100
debugger and my code base and that's it.

2112
02:07:36,200 --> 02:07:37,300
It's not plugged in the Internet.

2113
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:41,700
It's not plug in anything other than the the backup server, right?

2114
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,900
And that's just because yeah, like there's always a temptation to go

2115
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:49,600
do something else and so I find the easiest way to not do something

2116
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:49,800
else.

2117
02:07:49,800 --> 02:07:53,500
It's just not have the ability to something else and you know, that's

2118
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:57,100
what it was like growing up because there was no internet, you know.

2119
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,300
And so you know, it just tends to be about trying to maintain good

2120
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:07,600
habits and I think anyone can learn to focus and stay focused.

2121
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:09,700
Sometimes it requires

2122
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,600
Paying attention to things that you wouldn't normally pay attention to

2123
02:08:15,300 --> 02:08:19,000
like, for example, making sure that you things that you would never

2124
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,200
necessarily think of can be important.

2125
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:25,900
Like, for example, what you eat, like what you eat in the morning, you

2126
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:30,800
know, maybe you work better on a cup of coffee and you know, some

2127
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:35,200
bacon or something like this and how much you eat is important.

2128
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:39,100
You know what your blood sugar is what your mental state is, that sort

2129
02:08:39,100 --> 02:08:41,100
of stuff is affected by these sorts of things.

2130
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:45,400
Getting regular exercise stuff like that just you know, maintaining a

2131
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:50,900
healthy sort of environment for your brain, in terms of both, what's

2132
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:52,700
on your computer, what you're doing with computer.

2133
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:56,600
But also like physically also helps a lot, right?

2134
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,700
If you're feeling tired all the time,

2135
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,800
Or you're, you know, you're, you're having a sugar crash or whatever.

2136
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:08,600
Those are bad things that would that make it hard to say Focus to

2137
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:24,000
I think the sweet up is due to wrong, offsets of the simulation

2138
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,700
regions, for the multi-threaded tasks.

2139
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:27,300
Use the tile size for calc.

2140
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:32,300
Not the chunk room size that could be true.

2141
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:32,800
Yeah.

2142
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:34,200
Like if those are not.

2143
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,100
Well I don't really know.

2144
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,700
Yeah but yeah I agree with that because I didn't I'm not particularly

2145
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:42,500
careful about what was going on there since those are made up.

2146
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:45,200
Points.

2147
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,200
That you intend to use 3D will the code support software rendering?

2148
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:57,600
Yeah, I think so we may not support all the features but we I think

2149
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,500
we'll probably still keep that path updated.

2150
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:05,200
Is the career advice episode.

2151
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:05,800
Upload it anywhere?

2152
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,800
I'm having trouble finding it.

2153
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:07,800
It'll be up.

2154
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
It all three parts will be up shortly as a blog post and they'll also

2155
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:12,600
be on the hand.

2156
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:16,000
I mean, they'll still be on YouTube, but they'll be in a blog post to.

2157
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,700
So all three are kept together and with links, I'll be copying and

2158
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:23,600
pasting links from the things people wrote In.

2159
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:28,100
You said, you want to remove the notion of rooms layers from the

2160
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:30,600
drawing routine but don't you still need it for fading in the room

2161
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:31,200
above you?

2162
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:35,500
I don't believe so because like I said, since we're going to move to

2163
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:38,000
3D will now be able to use the standard tricks we would have used

2164
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,300
their which is to say, all we have to do is just go like okay you

2165
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:42,700
know,

2166
02:10:44,500 --> 02:10:48,000
There's a certain height above the camera.

2167
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,800
What when we set the camera in this update for camera routine, we know

2168
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:56,800
how high that the ceiling of that room is and that'll just be a

2169
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:03,400
property of the camera that we then use with the z-buffer to do two

2170
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:07,500
passes, one pass with for everything in front of that Z level, and one

2171
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:10,200
Pastor everything before it into two separate buffers.

2172
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:10,900
Right?

2173
02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:13,500
So we now kind of have the ability to do a

2174
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:16,900
Of of sassier things.

2175
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,800
Let's see, posting me.

2176
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,500
You said that 20 seconds to build is a reasonable amount of time.

2177
02:11:31,900 --> 02:11:33,700
Well I wouldn't have to say it's a reasonable amount of time.

2178
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:37,100
I would say that it isn't necessarily the amount of it isn't.

2179
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,600
The amount of time where I would, automatically think it's a problem.

2180
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:41,500
Right?

2181
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:48,200
So, if it takes 20 seconds to rebuild the entire project, I wouldn't

2182
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:52,200
necessarily stop what I was doing and go focus on that as my primary

2183
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,100
problem, right?

2184
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,700
I like to keep things much faster than that, but I can live

2185
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,500
It in that range, somewhere around a minute.

2186
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:09,300
It becomes obviously, the biggest problem you have right?

2187
02:12:10,300 --> 02:12:16,600
And you know where exactly that breaking point is is hard to quantify

2188
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:22,100
the faster, the Build, The Better pretty much down to about somewhere

2189
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,000
under a second.

2190
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:26,300
So, you know, a bill that takes one s better than a bill that takes

2191
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,700
two seconds, right?

2192
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:29,800
But

2193
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,600
At some point, a bill that takes 50 milliseconds is not better than a

2194
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,700
bill that takes 100 milliseconds for the most part.

2195
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,900
At least not in any way that I've ever been able to German.

2196
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:46,700
So yeah, I don't really know how to quantify those things in any way.

2197
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:51,500
Other than to say that there's an obvious Breaking Point somewhere and

2198
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:55,700
I mean, you know, 30 minutes is obviously a disaster which is not a

2199
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:56,300
straw man.

2200
02:12:56,300 --> 02:12:59,100
There's lots of bills that take over 30 minutes to rebuild the whole

2201
02:12:59,100 --> 02:13:02,000
code base and I that's just a huge problem, right?

2202
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:03,900
So,

2203
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:11,700
all right, last questions off topic will handmade con 2016

2204
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:13,300
video-on-demand be on YouTube soon?

2205
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:18,000
It's out of my hands right now, folks volunteered to edit the videos,

2206
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,600
and they are editing the videos to combine the camera footage because

2207
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:24,300
it's just a bunch of rock camera footages when they're done.

2208
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:25,500
They will be posted.

2209
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:27,000
But I don't know when that is

2210
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,100
Come and see me too.

2211
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,200
How long did the witness take to build?

2212
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:41,100
I don't remember, but quite fast by comparison to most projects that I

2213
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:47,800
kind of come onto that I wasn't in charge of like I want to say that

2214
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:52,600
you could build the whole project in 30 seconds, maybe on a good

2215
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,200
machine.

2216
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,800
So you know was it as fast as I would like projects to be built.

2217
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:03,800
No was it well within tolerable range?

2218
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,500
Yes on the witness.

2219
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:06,000
I would say.

2220
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,700
The thing that I had much more trouble with was startup time of the

2221
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:15,600
game and I think that was probably because I didn't really know enough

2222
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:18,900
about how to do some of the artwork flow things.

2223
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:23,600
So I usually ended up getting around that by having a

2224
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:25,500
like a

2225
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:34,000
Test level thing that I kind of built that I could load into, and not

2226
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,300
have to go through whatever was having.

2227
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:39,300
But there's I think the, the way that the witness was was structured,

2228
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:44,100
there are several parts that I wasn't really very knowledgeable about.

2229
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:48,800
And so, my experiences with it are not really representative of what

2230
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,100
it would be like if you were someone who's normally on the team, but

2231
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:56,800
I'm, you know, my recollection of building the witness was that it

2232
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,600
was, you know, well with

2233
02:14:58,800 --> 02:14:59,800
Thin, the speed.

2234
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:05,000
Of rebuild that would not be a problem at all.

2235
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,100
And again, that's because John cares about this sort of thing, right?

2236
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:13,200
You know, he, I don't think he would be super psyched if his if his

2237
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:17,400
game took someone saying 5 to 10 minutes to build.

2238
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,200
Like, no, it's nothing like that.

2239
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:23,500
The witness was very fast to build by any modern game standards.

2240
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:26,600
Like I said, a lot of them are just incredibly slow, you know, if the

2241
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:33,300
you can build the entire witness engine and game in probably, you

2242
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:36,300
know, I'm imagining the amount of time it would take you to build, you

2243
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:38,600
know, 10 files of the Unreal Engine.

2244
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:45,900
It's, you know, it's it was very sensibly architected for that.

2245
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:51,300
All right, I'll go ahead and wrap it up.

2246
02:15:56,900 --> 02:15:59,000
Okay, thanks everyone for joining me for this episode of handmade

2247
02:15:59,000 --> 02:15:59,200
hero.

2248
02:15:59,200 --> 02:16:00,400
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

2249
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:04,100
As always, if you want to follow along at home, you can always fear to

2250
02:16:04,100 --> 02:16:06,500
the game on handmade here a.org and it comes to the source code.

2251
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:10,800
So you can play around with it and learn from sort of the sort of

2252
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,100
stuff we're doing on stream.

2253
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:18,100
We also have Forum site if you want to ask questions and a patreon, if

2254
02:16:18,100 --> 02:16:20,500
you want to support the video series, we have a schedule bot that

2255
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,700
tweets the schedule at you.

2256
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:26,200
And I'm going to be upgrading that soon to correctly handle weekend

2257
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:26,500
stream.

2258
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,700
Little bit better right now.

2259
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:30,100
I kind of threw it manually because it was really built for weekday

2260
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:30,700
streams.

2261
02:16:31,900 --> 02:16:33,100
And then we also have an episode guide.

2262
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:35,700
You can go to if you want to catch up on stuff that happened before,

2263
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:37,700
that's about it.

2264
02:16:37,799 --> 02:16:41,799
I will be back next week for more programming where we'll try to

2265
02:16:41,799 --> 02:16:46,700
finish up that room based stuff and maybe create some different sized

2266
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:47,299
rooms in the game.

2267
02:16:47,299 --> 02:16:50,000
So we can verify that, that's actually working properly, until then

2268
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,200
have fun programming, and I'll see you everyone on the internet.

2269
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,100
Take it easy, everybody.
