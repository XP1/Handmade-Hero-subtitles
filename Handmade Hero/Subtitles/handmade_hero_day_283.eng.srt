1
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,700
This Isaac asks, do you have any favorite insects?

2
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,200
I don't really like insects, so I don't think I could have a favorite

3
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,600
one.

4
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,600
Good evening.

5
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,000
Casey had a bit of a Nutter moment today while annotating as you went

6
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,200
to the episode guide to double-check what day it was, but the expected

7
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
previous day was not there.

8
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,100
But I mean, that's okay, it's not it's not always completely

9
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,600
up-to-date, right?

10
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,300
Because I mean, you know, it's got to be annotated so, but we're on

11
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,700
the right day, right?

12
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
So this is 280, 281 282 283, so that's right.

13
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,200
And this one's all up-to-date.

14
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,500
So I mean, yeah, it's at most ever just one behind it seems because

15
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
you keep it really up to date.

16
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,100
So

17
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,500
Andrew JDR, if there are multiple GL context and use of the same time

18
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,200
in both have workload simultaneously, how does the GPU GPU driver,

19
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
decide to schedule.

20
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,700
Those workloads.

21
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,300
I noticed that window seems to prioritize the active Windows opengl

22
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,100
context, if you happen to have multiple opengl context, the same time,

23
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,900
so that's kind of interesting.

24
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,800
I guess what I would say there is I have absolutely no idea.

25
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,500
There's obviously a fair bit of

26
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,700
Rot in the opengl windows binding layer because again, Microsoft wants

27
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,900
to push their standards so they tend not to support opengl really at

28
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,200
all.

29
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,300
But the driver vendors do want to support it and so they typically

30
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,200
have sort of their own Solutions and stuff like this.

31
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,100
So I would point out for example, on Nvidia, it would depend on what

32
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,600
kind of cards are using the drivers for their high-end cards.

33
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,800
Will actually allow you to Target different.

34
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,500
Gpus separately and other things like this for opengl context.

35
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,200
And so I could imagine that on some of those drivers they might do

36
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,600
things like actually balance across multiple gpus if you have them and

37
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,300
all that sort of stuff.

38
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know.

39
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,300
But what happens in terms of balancing it otherwise I really couldn't

40
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,700
tell you.

41
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,600
I don't know that's a good question for like an Nvidia driver Dev or

42
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
something and be like what you know?

43
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's say I've got three applications open that are all using opengl.

44
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
What do you know?

45
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,900
How are you?

46
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,600
Deciding how that gets sliced up and is it you know bay just based on

47
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,200
the same priorities you know if if an application at a higher priority

48
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,400
than other application would it get higher opengl priority to or you

49
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,100
know and I don't I have no idea.

50
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,200
It's not something I've ever really looked at.

51
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
What are your thoughts on flowchart, based programming?

52
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
And do you think they are effective in game programming?

53
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,500
I don't think I really know what the term flow chart based programming

54
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,299
would mean.

55
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,500
Obviously I know what a flowchart is, but I don't know that.

56
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,299
I know what it would mean to say that you were doing flow chart.

57
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,400
Based programming, if you're talking about something like a uml

58
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,500
diagram, oh my God, no.

59
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,800
I don't think they're useful for any kind of programming, but that may

60
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,800
not be really what you mean by flow chart based programming.

61
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,200
So I don't know.

62
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,700
You're paying on the Vulcan Epi.

63
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,200
I do not like it.

64
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,700
Okay, so flow chart based programming you meant

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,800
Like a visual programming language, for lack of a better term, like

66
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,900
sort of the kind that you use to make Shader graphs in Maya or those

67
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,800
sorts of things.

68
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,600
My opinions on those is, I don't really see the value in them from

69
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,500
everything I've ever seen, all they do is help.

70
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,400
You make very simple things.

71
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,700
Without having to, you know, by dragging and dropping some nodes

72
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,600
around, right?

73
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,600
But making simple things is never interesting to me, like I don't need

74
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
a programming language to help me make simple things.

75
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,700
I can make simple things and see really easy, right?

76
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,300
The hard part about anything that you're trying to make programming

77
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,000
wise is making complex things.

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And that's where those systems always seem to completely fall over,

79
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,500
right?

80
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,500
It's like, as soon as you start to make complex things, you've got

81
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,000
this huge rats nest of like nodes with, like all the stuff between

82
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
And someone comes looks like I have no idea what I'm looking at,

83
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,600
right?

84
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,600
So I've never really seen an interesting thing done with graphical

85
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,100
programming languages.

86
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,700
I, which is not to say, I don't think there's a value to be had

87
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,600
potentially in them.

88
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,600
I just don't think people have made anything interesting with them

89
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:47,900
yet.

90
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,800
Like they haven't made one that actually leverages the graphical

91
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,900
aspect to do anything other than make it harder to create complex

92
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,000
from, which is the opposite.

93
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
It of what you would want to do, right?

94
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
You'd want to leverage the graphics to make it easier.

95
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,600
Which I think about structured editors.

96
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,500
I like the idea of structured editors but I've never really used one,

97
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,900
so I don't have like a.

98
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,400
I like the idea that editing should be more about what your editing

99
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,600
and not just about generic text.

100
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,900
So I think it's a prep like it's a, it's a good direction, the

101
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,600
probable direction to go in but I don't really know like

102
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,500
Much about it in practice because I've never used one.

103
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,100
And I don't know whether anyone's made one, that's like actually

104
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,800
usable and good, you know?

105
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,700
Susan, Kim 73.

106
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
That's a great quote.

107
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,700
I think that the main use case of boxes and arrows type programming is

108
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,200
to convince non-programmers that they're not programming.

109
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,100
It's a very good way to say that.

110
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Where are we on the handmade hero to do?

111
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,800
I don't know.

112
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Like the to do is just there if I run out of things to do that, I'm

113
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
actively doing right?

114
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,500
The to do is like, wait, what should we do now?

115
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,900
I don't know, and then I can go look at the do, but if I have stuff

116
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,500
that I want to do, I like to do list or just in that, for that case.

117
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,700
If I'm afraid that I might forget about some things, I might do.

118
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,600
And so then later, when I'm, like, I need something to do.

119
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,300
But right now, I know what I want to do.

120
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,100
You know, I know when I

121
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,300
Wind, we're working on so it hasn't been a problem.

122
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,400
Alright stream begins now.

123
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Skip this go and stop recording.

124
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,400
Start recording.

125
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,900
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

126
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
The show we could a complete game live on stream.

127
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,500
We are well essentially what we've got to do is crack open a new

128
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,000
aspect of our simulation and get it a little bit more up to speed.

129
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,100
We fixed a bunch of things with it as we're sort of on our march to

130
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,200
doing more final Style game code and we kind of need to start

131
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,100
addressing physics and other things like that.

132
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,100
We, you know have had sort of a makeshift

133
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,000
Poor little thing for physics and movement in there for a very, very

134
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,400
long time, but we need to now start getting into a more realistic.

135
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,200
Not realistic in the, in the sense of behaves like real physics, but I

136
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:05,300
mean, a more professional, more complete, a more shippable state for

137
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,400
that parts of the code.

138
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
So we've got a couple different things we need to do.

139
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
And there's also a little bit of renderer thing in there as well.

140
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,200
So we've got essentially, two things.

141
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,000
One is that we have to go.

142
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,600
Figure out how we're going to make the physical side of things work.

143
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,300
And the other part is we got to figure out how we want to deal with

144
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,500
the multi-plane Z and I said yesterday, how I wanted that to shake

145
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:26,900
out?

146
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We've got to actually do the work of making it clean and efficient

147
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,700
through the renderer.

148
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,600
So let's go ahead and dive in here.

149
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Today is day 283.

150
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,800
So if you would like to follow along at home, you're going to want to

151
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,000
start with de 282 source code because that's what I'm starting with.

152
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,300
At the moment.

153
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
So let's actually, I should probably try to load something.

154
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,300
First before I build building, nothing does not help us much.

155
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,800
And let's go ahead and run this here.

156
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right, so here's where we left things.

157
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,900
We sort of were playing around with multiple Heights here and you can

158
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,500
already see to.

159
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
We have like our makeshift sorting, we kind of broke our mixture,

160
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,700
sorting on the guy as well because we have, you know, he doesn't quite

161
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,200
sort correctly because we used a bias there.

162
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
So, when his his head doesn't we got, we got tons of stuff.

163
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,700
We want to fix in, in all of that stuff, right?

164
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,200
And so now is a good time to kind of start cracking, open all of these

165
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,600
things.

166
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,300
How the, how the simulation Works physically and how the

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,100
He gets handled so we can start to take these elements that are not

168
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,900
quite right and make them into something that we're confident in so

169
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,500
that we don't have to constantly deal with them as we sort of go to

170
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,800
ship other parts of the game.

171
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,400
So anyway, in terms of what we should do first, I think probably the

172
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,600
easiest thing to do would be to focus on the world representation

173
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,100
first and get that down to where I'm happy with how the Z is handled

174
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,300
there.

175
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,400
And say, this is done, this is how he works because we're I don't

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:15:59,900
think we're that far.

177
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,300
Are from being able to do that.

178
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,800
And then what I'd like to do is shift over to the renderer and make it

179
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,700
so that representation flows into the renderer nicely and so that we

180
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,900
can get rid of our sorting bugs and that sort of stuff at that point,

181
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,500
right?

182
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,300
Because the renderer sorts quite nicely, but we don't feed it.

183
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,900
Very good information right now.

184
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,700
So it ends up doing, you know, it ends up not knowing what we want in

185
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,500
front of other.

186
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
It doesn't know for example that the heads always puts up here on top

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
of the body, so it can't ever do that sort correctly and so there's a

188
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,800
bunch of things like that that we just

189
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,600
To start treating more seriously.

190
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Okay?

191
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,700
So what I'm going to do, first of all, like, you can already kind of

192
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,900
see that I have problems.

193
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,900
For example, I can't go, I can't always go nor like if I'm trying to

194
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,400
go north.

195
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I and the reason for that is my head actually runs into it collides

196
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,300
with the ground tiles because right now, these ground tiles that I'm

197
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,600
hopping on these little those little Center dots that I'm hopping on.

198
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
They actually have a collision volume.

199
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,500
We're not drawing The Collection volume, but and that means my head

200
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,300
could run into it and stop and not go any further, right?

201
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,200
So that's not necessarily a bad thing.

202
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
We do want the cops to occlusion volumes but again, we haven't really

203
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,200
taken the time to go in and now say, now that we know exactly how this

204
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,200
stuff works, let's make the Collision volumes actually be reasonable

205
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,700
and how they're going to be structured and all that sort of stuff.

206
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,300
And then furthermore, we've never really fully done how we want our

207
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,400
Collision detection of work.

208
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,300
So now that we have a little bit more of a solid understanding of how

209
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
the game behaves.

210
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,800
I want to go in there and kind of make that a little bit more real and

211
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,300
I should probably

212
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
only take a minute to sort of talk about the fact that since this

213
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,900
game's design is kind of peculiar in the sense that there's this

214
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,200
concept of the, the head is a separate piece from the body, right?

215
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,800
And I move the head, you know what I actually control is, I control

216
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,900
the head as I move back and forth.

217
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,900
What's interesting about that is the body always moves to a discrete

218
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,600
point, right?

219
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,900
And we talked about how that's kind,

220
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
An important part of the game design.

221
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,400
What that means is that I have to start thinking about how Collision

222
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,100
detection is going to work in a very game, specific way, right?

223
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,200
We are so far from wanting to simulate realistic physics here because

224
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,300
if we were going to simulate realistic physics, we did.

225
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,700
We would lose sort of the binary nature of.

226
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,000
Can I hop to this next Square or can't?

227
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,400
I right, because what happens if maybe there's some kind of and I'll

228
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,800
jump to the pun intended, I'll jump

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,100
Over to the Blackboard here for a second.

230
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,500
Let me go ahead and scroll up here, so there's my day 283.

231
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,100
So what you know I am wanted to get across here was just if I imagine

232
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,600
two points that I can hop between and the hero doing the Hop, like so

233
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,500
while the hero is jumping, okay?

234
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,700
So the hero is like here and jumping up and it comes to here, right?

235
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,700
You know what word would happen if there was someone else who was in

236
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
transit to this square at the same time, okay?

237
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,100
There's a couple of different things that could happen here and we

238
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,800
would have to decide how we wanted to treat them one way.

239
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,700
Is that they both bounce off each other.

240
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,600
So the fact that two people try to enter the square if they Collide

241
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,300
before landing on the Square then they bounce back to their previous

242
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:29,800
square.

243
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,400
Right.

244
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,600
Another is to to take whoever was getting in first and use that,

245
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,200
right?

246
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,100
And another is that they I don't know.

247
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
Some other thing where they both

248
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,500
Probably the square somehow.

249
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm not sure.

250
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,000
Right?

251
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,700
But no matter what I'd pick, you can see why this is a tricky problem

252
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,200
because I can always add another layer of problem.

253
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,300
To it to make the solution, not make sense.

254
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,200
So for example,

255
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,100
Let's say I was doing the exact same thing, right?

256
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,500
So two people inbound here, and whatever the rule is that I pick.

257
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,400
It's going to involve this one getting bounced back.

258
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,000
But while that's happening, someone else is inbound on this square,

259
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,800
right?

260
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,800
So, now, if this person reaches disc, where first, and this person

261
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,500
reaches disc, where first, this person who was caught here, has

262
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,600
nowhere to land.

263
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,000
Right there is effectively caught in limbo in between two squares and

264
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,200
there's no where they can go, right?

265
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,700
And so one of the things about this game that's kind of tricky and I'm

266
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,200
not sure how we want to deal with it, is there has to be a solid set

267
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,600
of rules that have nothing to do with physics, that are about how to

268
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,600
resolve who gets to stand on what squares win because the game is very

269
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,500
much about the concept that people have to be standing on a particular

270
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:51,900
Square.

271
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,100
That's a requirement of the way, the game is designed.

272
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,100
So there has to be a set of consistent rules as to how this is going

273
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,500
to work, if that makes sense.

274
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,000
So there's a couple different things we can do.

275
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,800
One is we can do some kind of a halfway requirement, right?

276
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,700
So what we could do and this is, I guess what I'm kind of leaning

277
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,200
towards doing is we could say, all right, when you hop on a square,

278
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,300
essentially, if you are ever inside this boundary of the square, that

279
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,200
means you are occupying this place.

280
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,400
And no one else is allowed to hop into it, right?

281
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,900
When you get to this boundary, there is then a transactional

282
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,500
operation, which occurs, which says am I allowed to occupy the square

283
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,700
that I was hopping into.

284
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,500
And if the answer is yes, then you will now relinquish the square

285
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
atomically and take this one, right?

286
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,000
And you will be allowed to continue down and land here.

287
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,200
Okay?

288
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,100
If not if you get to this boundary and you are not allowed to take

289
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,900
that square, then you will be

290
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
I sort of reflected back and you'll land back on the Square that you

291
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,300
took because you will never release the square unless you can take a

292
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:12,500
new square and my thinking is that's probably what I want the physics

293
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,000
system to be based around.

294
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Okay.

295
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,400
So, I think we're going to effectively have two types of things in the

296
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,200
physics system.

297
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,800
All right ones that operate like this and we'll call this Atomic cop.

298
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,100
Right?

299
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,200
And you can see nothing to do with physics physics, really.

300
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,700
It's just I cross over the the halfway boundary between two points.

301
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,400
I try to take that point.

302
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,200
If I can't take that point, I'd go back to my other point, right?

303
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,700
And I think that's how we would have to do it.

304
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,800
So something like this.

305
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,600
And the other one is basically projectile.

306
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,800
Or like, you know, floating, right?

307
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,300
So something that's actually kind of not occupying a square.

308
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,100
It just kind of floats around and so it's just it can started be doing

309
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,000
more standard physics where it just it can bump and move and it

310
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,700
doesn't it doesn't necessarily have a concept of occupying anything,

311
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,400
right?

312
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,800
And this would be Primal.

313
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,600
So this is the most important thing because all of the heroes

314
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
gameplay, obviously requires that.

315
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,600
But then this is obviously secondary.

316
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:36,000
And, you know, this the head is this and the body is this and enemies

317
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,300
would be, you know, a combination of these as well.

318
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,800
Like, some enemies would have both, some enemies would have only one

319
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,500
or the other.

320
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,600
Obviously, like things like, you know, projectiles that are that are

321
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,400
sort of thrown or whatever would be.

322
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,100
If you talk how I feel right now this is not as easy as it sounds

323
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,400
unfortunately as well because it means that we sort of have to do a

324
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,700
hybrid physics e.

325
00:23:59,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Well,

326
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,900
Maybe didn't send me the you know that I shouldn't say it's not as

327
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,600
easy as it sounds.

328
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,500
I guess.

329
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,600
What I'm where I mean is there are some subtleties involved here even

330
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,600
with the well-articulated rule that I was sort of suggesting and that

331
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,000
is that you can imagine.

332
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,800
We still might want situations where let's say there's a line of

333
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,000
points like so

334
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,800
And someone's going to be knocked back.

335
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,900
We still want the concept of them sort of flying back through here,

336
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,500
right?

337
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh, dear.

338
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,100
I drew behind my head.

339
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,500
I was wondering why it wasn't showing up.

340
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,300
And it's like, I forgot there's a, there's a me down there.

341
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,400
So let's suppose that the hero is standing here, you know, and they

342
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,600
get knocked back.

343
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,800
Well, they may want to slide backwards across many squares, right?

344
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,400
And so, you know, the concept of hopping, it's really not hopping,

345
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,700
it's just the concept of physical movement, but that has to be

346
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,400
transactional in the points that it's occupying, right?

347
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:03,500
And so, you know, we're not going to do it as a specific hopping up.

348
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,600
Peter kind of thing.

349
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,000
We're going to have to do it as a movement operator, that just happens

350
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,100
to be transactional.

351
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,200
As far as points are concerned and we'll just have to make sure that

352
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:12,900
that's okay.

353
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Whereas anything that's a projectile doesn't have to have that it can

354
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,600
projectiles, could be allowed to do whatever they want.

355
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,800
And you know so long as they don't collide with something that's fine.

356
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,600
And presumably they would have to have the rule that they are sort of

357
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,500
secondary in the sense that this is a hard constraint and so,

358
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,100
So this constraint means that no matter what happens, if a projectile

359
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,400
would be occupying the location where somebody needs to return to in

360
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
order to continue owning their square.

361
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,900
That projectiles going to have to move out of the way or you know even

362
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,200
to sort of a difficult difficult situation.

363
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,000
For example, where let's say we have

364
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,300
Four Points here and there's people standing on each of the four

365
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
points, right?

366
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,000
It could trap a large projectile in here in in between and stuff like

367
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,500
that is just going to have to be allowed, right?

368
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,100
Because the but the the concept of the square occupation is going to

369
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,700
have to be Primal and going to have to be the most important thing and

370
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,900
you're never going to be allowed to evict somebody from Square without

371
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
having a new square for them to go to.

372
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:31,200
Now, there's some tricky Parts about this and the tricky Parts about

373
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,400
this, I will, I will sort of illustrate to you now.

374
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,900
All right, so let's suppose we have a scenario where an enemy creature

375
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,500
is moving in this direction and the hero is up here and wants to move

376
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,300
in this direction, right?

377
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,200
Well, the problem with this scenario is that if the hero reaches the

378
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,700
halfway point here, before this enemy reaches, the halfway point here,

379
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,700
then the hero would get rebuffed right.

380
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,300
It would get the ear will get stopped there essentially.

381
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,500
Like, I can't move through it.

382
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:12,400
I don't know if that's a problem, but you can see why, you know why?

383
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,700
It might be because as this enemy is moving off of this Square, it

384
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,300
will appear to the player as if they could occupy it.

385
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,600
Because, you know, the enemy's gotten to there, by the time you get to

386
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,800
hear it seems like I should be able to hop in there, right?

387
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,900
And so, I don't really know what we want to do.

388
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
To do about that problematic scenario, but you can see why it's

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,500
problematic.

390
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,300
Hopefully, right, very tired.

391
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,300
So yeah, I don't really know what we want to do about that, but that's

392
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,600
an example of something that, you know, I think is going to cause US

393
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,200
problems.

394
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,600
It's a challenging aspect of the game design, that's just the way it

395
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,100
goes.

396
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
But hey, you know, the point is to do some real programming on the

397
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,200
stream.

398
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,600
Not to just do a little simple crappy things.

399
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,800
So we've got a complex thing to worry about and so we'll worry about

400
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,700
it and that's fine.

401
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,700
I don't have any other bright ideas about a how to handle this any

402
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
more smoothly than

403
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,100
Then a transactional taking of the squares and the reason for that is

404
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,700
if you if you don't do transactional taking of the squares, then you

405
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,700
could easily end up in a situation where somebody who needs to stand

406
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,200
on a square cannot stand on a square, right?

407
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
If you don't require it to be transactional, that could happen.

408
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,700
Very very, very, very easily.

409
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
So I don't really know.

410
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,900
I don't really know how we could do something all that much different

411
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,700
than this scheme.

412
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,300
Obviously, we could push this scheme a little further and say things

413
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,900
like, well, if I'm trying to move into a square and there's already

414
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,100
someone in that square who is also trying to move to another Square.

415
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,500
See if they can take their next Square early, right?

416
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,200
And then I can take, you know, my Square early.

417
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,100
That's one way to do it another way to do.

418
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,300
It would be to say that as soon as someone starts trying to take a

419
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,600
square they can take it if it's available, right?

420
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,800
And that way you would you would get in a situation where this person

421
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,000
is technically already a vacated the square and so I can move in

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,900
anytime I want you know, maybe that turns out to be a better policy

423
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,300
but again at the fundamental level, it's still basically all the same.

424
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,900
It's still basically just about how quickly I'm sorry that

425
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,100
Need to transactionally.

426
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Take release my current square and take a new one.

427
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,000
And so if we build the system around that, unless I'm missing

428
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
something, I think we need that.

429
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,100
And so if we build the system around that, then whatever our most,

430
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,700
whatever our favorite rule ends up, being at the end of the day, no

431
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,900
matter how hacky that rule turned out to be.

432
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,400
Maybe it's this crazy heinous thing that we've tuned for all sorts of

433
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,400
weird game, play scenarios, as long as it's all built on a solid,

434
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,800
underlying concept of

435
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
A transactional switch from one squared or another.

436
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,600
Then presumably we can make that other part as happy as we want and

437
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
we'll never have any bugs of the form.

438
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,300
This person can't find a place to stand because the transactional

439
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,700
underpinning would always ensure that that wouldn't be a problem.

440
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,500
Alright, so now that once we sort of have that in mind, let's talk

441
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,900
about a couple of the things that are a little bit tricky here and

442
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,200
might be problematic.

443
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,100
So you could imagine once we have the concept that you're trans

444
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,800
actually on a particular Square, then we would probably also want to

445
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,200
entertain the following notion and it may be such that.

446
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,700
We would rather not entertain this notion for reasons of undeserved.

447
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,200
For reasons of undefined ability or something.

448
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,300
But let's say I introduced the concept that I've got sort of a

449
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,000
merry-go-round here and here are the points that I can stand on the

450
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
Merry-Go-Round or well actually let's make it simple.

451
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,000
Will just say that I could stand on these points here.

452
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,100
Okay.

453
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,500
And this thing can rotate in space.

454
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,300
Let's say,

455
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:14,200
so this thing can spin around and here is, you know, it's sort of

456
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,000
Center Point as it rotates around.

457
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,700
If the hero was standing on one of these, we would probably expect the

458
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,200
hero to rotate with it.

459
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,300
Right now that wouldn't be particularly difficult to do because we

460
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,900
know that the hero was embedded at this particular point, we could

461
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,800
remember the offset of that particular point.

462
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,400
In fact, we could just store that as his location.

463
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,400
So when he comes back again, we could say, oh he was supposed to be on

464
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,500
this particular point of this entity.

465
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Where is that point put him there?

466
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,300
Right?

467
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,600
So it's pretty easy for us to allow you to rotate things like this to

468
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,500
rotate.

469
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,000
And have you stand on them?

470
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,400
Here's the problem with something like the heroes head.

471
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Again, if that happens to be a projectile, right?

472
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,800
If it's one of these then what could happen is imagine I somewhere

473
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,500
have sort of a beam let's say or something that sticks in here and

474
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,100
this beam is hovering like over the top of the merry-go-round.

475
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,300
Well, when I rotated into it, my head is going to hit it, right?

476
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,000
And my head cannot pass through the beam.

477
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,300
My body will pass under the beam and my head and my body will become

478
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,700
separated, right?

479
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,000
This would be like decapitating the hero right now.

480
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Probably, we don't really want that to happen.

481
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,400
So, what we would normally do is, we normally say, well, okay, you

482
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,300
know, if the hero is getting separated, it would behoove, you know,

483
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,400
the head would have to

484
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,900
pushed our side of the body would have to get pushed to move to

485
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,800
another nearby point where it could stand that wasn't getting

486
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,300
Underneath right.

487
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,800
And maybe we could devise some kind of an algorithm to make that

488
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,300
happen.

489
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,600
The problem I'm worried about is what if there aren't any other

490
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,300
squares.

491
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,700
So, first of all, you could imagine the simple case where, what if we

492
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,200
created and maybe the answer is you know, you just don't do this, but

493
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,900
I'm just going to give you the simple example.

494
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,500
First, what if I created a thing with?

495
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,900
Only one stand above point, right?

496
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,300
So it's effectively, just a beam like this that you're standing on and

497
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,800
there's another beam here that you can't that your head can't go

498
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,200
through.

499
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,000
So as I rotate through here,

500
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,400
Head and my body separate and there is no point.

501
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,900
There's nothing out here for me to push the body back onto.

502
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Right.

503
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,700
What do I do in that scenario?

504
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,000
Similarly, let's say I never construct anything like that.

505
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,000
Let's say I construct something just fine.

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,400
So here is the, you know, the situation again and here is the blocking

507
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,900
beam.

508
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,900
And the heroes standing here.

509
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,400
We're going to come through here.

510
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Let's say there's all these other points over here that he could stand

511
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,300
on.

512
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
Well great when he hits their will try to figure out to push them back

513
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,000
to him but what if there's just monsters on all of them?

514
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,400
Right.

515
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,200
So it wasn't that we created a situation that made it impossible for

516
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,000
the hero to do the right thing and knock adopted.

517
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,100
Its that, there is no way for them to actually hop off because well,

518
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,600
the series have look, here's means of egress right.

519
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,500
So that's Troublesome, right?

520
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,100
And there's a couple different ways we can address it.

521
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,000
One way, we can address, it is just say we never make this in the

522
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,500
game.

523
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,300
Right.

524
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,800
There is no such thing as head level obstacles.

525
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,199
Right.

526
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,100
And thinking that through,

527
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,500
I feel like for the most part, I can't think of a lot of reasons why,

528
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,000
it wouldn't be totally acceptable to say.

529
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,300
There's no such thing as optic obstacles, which prevent the head from

530
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,000
going somewhere, but not the body, right?

531
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,000
We could say that we could just say that, you know, whenever the head

532
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,800
runs into something, it pushes it out of the way.

533
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,400
So there's no such thing as soon as it exists at the head level, that

534
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,700
stops the head and furthermore, we would

535
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,500
Really care about anything like decapitation.

536
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,600
If it happened to a monster because we could just kill the monster and

537
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
that would be fun for the player.

538
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,900
What we don't want is to suddenly have the hero get killed just

539
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,400
because he can't seem to move off of the thing he's standing on,

540
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,700
right?

541
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:40,700
That that is not really a great feel for the game because we don't

542
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,200
want to, you know, we don't want to create a bunch of circumstances

543
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,500
where the element of the gameplay, which is you have to stand on these

544
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,700
points, becomes a nuisance for the player, the idea, is that supposed

545
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,500
to be interesting for the player to do that and there's a bunch of

546
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,600
mechanical

547
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,300
Annex that revolve around it.

548
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,500
So what we don't want to do is make it so that it's oh it's this thing

549
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
where you weirdly get decapitated.

550
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,700
Because we can't find a place to jump off of this swinging thing or

551
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,100
whatever.

552
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,600
Right?

553
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,300
So one you know, one thing is we say no have of obstacles.

554
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
The other thing we say is no, you know, no writable 's

555
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,100
Right?

556
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,400
If there isn't a thing that's, that's inexorably moving.

557
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,900
Then it's not a problem.

558
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,100
The other thing we could say is writable Czar halted.

559
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,500
Right.

560
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,200
So, if the, if the, if the hero is on something, he runs into

561
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,000
something like that, then it will stop the thing that's spinning

562
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,100
It just and you just, you know, it would not ever be allowed to

563
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,800
continue decapitating the player in that way, right?

564
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,500
So there's some options.

565
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,700
I don't know, which one's the right one, but, there you go.

566
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Now, what's interesting to me is, I don't know if I actually have any

567
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,600
cases, where I care about head level obstacles, I haven't really

568
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,300
thought of anything, particularly important gameplay-wise where that

569
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,700
would be useful.

570
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,700
The only time you would care is if the head and the body got separated

571
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,900
by some kind of a, you know, you had some kind of magical ability that

572
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,000
allows you to do that.

573
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,200
You wanted there to be different things that the head, you know, the

574
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
head still had to navigate a certain path instead of just being able

575
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,100
to float over things.

576
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,100
So there were like these head level obstacles, but even so I don't see

577
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,000
why those obstacles.

578
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,700
Couldn't be all the way up and down.

579
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,400
Like it would have to be a reason why you wanted the body to be able

580
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,000
to go places that the head couldn't go right.

581
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,500
And furthermore, I don't know how important that right, that would

582
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,600
really be anyway.

583
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,100
Because it's much, you know, I can certainly make it so that the head

584
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,600
can go places.

585
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,700
The body can't go, I just can't make it to the body.

586
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,000
Can go places the head can't go.

587
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,200
So, I don't know.

588
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,000
I don't know.

589
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,100
I guess I don't really have a strong opinion of that one way or the

590
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,500
other.

591
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
But like I said, you kind of see the basics of what has to happen so

592
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,300
we can ruminate on that a little bit more but for now, hopefully you

593
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,700
can see the first sort of stuff that we would have to build physics.

594
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,600
Wise is we just have to know that transactional movement element.

595
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,600
And so right now that's happening entirely in sort of our hacked

596
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,900
gameplay code for the hero and only the hero is thinking about this,

597
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,100
right?

598
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,600
But we need to have happen very shortly.

599
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,000
Here is we want everyone to be going through that system.

600
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,200
So what I want to do is I want to change over to having that notion of

601
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,500
what square, you know, I'm occupied.

602
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,100
I want to start making that.

603
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,200
I think be inside the same region as a first class thing.

604
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,100
All right.

605
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,300
So, let's see.

606
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,900
I'm going to go ahead and open up some region.

607
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,500
And entity.

608
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,000
And right now, the way that we're doing this is every time.

609
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,800
Like, and for example, in these situations, all this stuff, every time

610
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,300
we are talking about those movement points in the hero, we actually

611
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,900
make that we do that operation every time through the loop, like every

612
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,900
frame, we do a search again to figure out what, like point the head is

613
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,100
over and what point the body is over and so on, right?

614
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,500
So what we could do is start by making this a little more formal,

615
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,200
okay?

616
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,700
And have it so that we actually track what point the the hero is on.

617
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:09,900
So go into the Sim region at a formal concept of the query for where,

618
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,100
you know, what's the closest one or whatever, at a formal concert of

619
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,700
that, where we can then record that in the entity struck and say, here

620
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,100
is where I'm actually, here's what I'm actually standing on this

621
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
particular point.

622
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,100
Okay.

623
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:32,300
Insu movement, from and movement to would be good examples of of what

624
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,400
that would be right?

625
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,700
Because movement, from, and movement to right now are always two

626
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,200
points.

627
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,300
I'm going from this point to this other point and so we would want

628
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,500
these and now be semantics in the sense that these are now entity

629
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,000
traversable 's, right?

630
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,800
So we would have something like, you know, entity traversable or maybe

631
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,000
just a traversable

632
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,800
Reference.

633
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,800
You know, in a traversable reference would be a lot like an entity

634
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,500
reference.

635
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,100
Right?

636
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,900
Here's the end of the reference, but in addition to the entity

637
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,400
reference would have another piece of information.

638
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,900
Like, so where we said, what's the the index of of the that

639
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,600
reversible?

640
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,800
So we can go grab that other entity and pull the traversable out, the

641
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,000
one that we care about specifically.

642
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,200
And so here, when we have movement to, and movement from, I could

643
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,700
start by saying, well, alright movement to movement, from are now

644
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,200
going to actually be traversals, right?

645
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,600
So I've got reversible here.

646
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,700
And traversable here.

647
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,800
Like so, so what would happen?

648
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,800
If all I did was just change the code to this, right?

649
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,100
And if I was so inclined, you can imagine me actually pulling the V3

650
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:50,900
out of here as well.

651
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,000
Where we just, when we unpack, we do it.

652
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,800
I don't know that we want to do that because entities could move

653
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,300
during Sim and we probably don't want to worry about that.

654
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,800
So I'm probably going to keep it.

655
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,400
This.

656
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,300
All right.

657
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,900
So let's take a look at what's going on here.

658
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,400
So here is the identity calls, right?

659
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
This is interesting, this is still called a damn, they probably want

660
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,500
to name it, something better but this is this is essentially what

661
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,500
brings it into the into the simulation.

662
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,200
And what you can see here is we're taking the movement from and we're

663
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,000
applying that chunk Delta to it, which is how we produce the offset.

664
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,400
But now that's not what these are going to be.

665
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:39,300
So now what we want to do is these are going to be again delayed by

666
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,700
one.

667
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,000
Since we want to look up specific traversable, 's we

668
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,600
Want to process these until after when we do our Loop through, right?

669
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,700
So these are going to become things where we do load traversable

670
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,900
reference, like so.

671
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,500
So we're going to connect this up in here where we do Sim region desk

672
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,900
movement, from, right?

673
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
That's going to be a thing here where we do

674
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,800
are loading.

675
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,800
So movement from a movement to are both going to get loaded this

676
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
reversal references.

677
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,800
So in load entity reference

678
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,500
Oops.

679
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,900
Where we hit the hash table here.

680
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,900
This is actually going to be exactly the same thing.

681
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,200
It's just going to, it's just going to sort of think through, right?

682
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,800
So here's load reversible reference, we've got our traversable

683
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,500
reference

684
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,700
And what we're going to do there is say, alright first, let's try to

685
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,200
get the the try to get the entity.

686
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,200
So let's load the entity reference

687
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,400
for the traversal reference.

688
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
then if we got the remedy,

689
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
well then I guess that's it.

690
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,900
Now that I think about it, since we're not going to pull the V3 out of

691
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,300
there.

692
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:58,800
We're good.

693
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,600
So that's load reversible, F reference and we're going to need the

694
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
reverse as well.

695
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,100
So we're going to need a storage reversible reference and again it's

696
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,500
really just a thunk at this point because we don't have anything else

697
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,700
that we need to do in particular about it.

698
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,400
So all it's going to do is call store entity reference on its

699
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,100
traversable on the entity part of its reversal reference.

700
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay, let's compile that here.

701
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,700
Sim Regan is not a thing.

702
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,100
So now we come down to here where we're doing.

703
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,200
Our story entity reference.

704
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,400
We're going to do the same thing here where we store the traversable

705
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,800
reference.

706
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,300
Again, it's exactly analogous.

707
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,400
It's just a translation in and out part of the process.

708
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,900
And now we just have to go work on the actual code that we had from

709
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,500
before.

710
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,700
Where

711
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
In our movement, from, in our movement to now, this shouldn't be too

712
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,700
hard because our get closest.

713
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,900
Reversible already knows this piece of information.

714
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,500
So, presumably it shouldn't be too difficult for us.

715
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:14,800
All right.

716
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,600
So let's keep going through here.

717
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
I just want to take a quick look to see if there's anything.

718
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,100
Any other any other gotchas in here?

719
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,100
I don't think there are.

720
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Yeah, so that's really it.

721
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,900
So now we just have to write that code.

722
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,200
So the first thing I'm going to do is say well this get closest

723
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,800
reversible.

724
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,500
I don't know that's sitting up here somewhere.

725
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,800
This get closest reversible is really going to be something that

726
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,400
happens in the same region.

727
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,000
I think at this point it's probably going to have to be accelerated

728
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,000
and a lot of other stuff blah blah blah blah blah right now.

729
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,300
So I'm just going to put that

730
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,200
In here.

731
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,900
And then we're going to take a look at it.

732
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,100
So here is a are streaming stuff.

733
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,300
Let me go ahead, I know where it should be, probably down at the

734
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,100
bottom for now.

735
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,400
So when we call get close to traversable, now, what we're going to do

736
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,900
instead of providing the V3 is we're actually going to want to provide

737
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,200
one of these references.

738
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,700
So we're going to want to provide a traversable reference.

739
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,300
So when we come through here will know whether or not it was found

740
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:15,700
right?

741
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,900
We still have want that.

742
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,100
But now when we have like test entity in that stuff, we're going to

743
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,600
want to say.

744
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,100
OK, the result here and I'll clear the result first, right?

745
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,400
I guess.

746
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,400
Well actually know what I can do.

747
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,900
I can look at the found if it was not found, right?

748
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,200
I can take the result entity and set it to 0, basically, just clear it

749
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,600
out.

750
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,900
So in here, if I'm going to search through the volume group for which

751
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,300
traversable it is, then all I need to do is when we find the closest

752
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,200
one, instead of storing the position of that thing, which is not what

753
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,400
I actually want.

754
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,800
Instead, I'm going to go ahead and store.

755
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:06,200
So yeah, there's probably one of the thing I want to do but it will

756
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,700
get that saying I'm not going to store the position of it, instead of

757
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,300
at the moment.

758
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,900
I'm just going to store The Entity pointer.

759
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,600
So here is our, what is it?

760
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,300
Test entity.

761
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,300
So I'm going to start a test entity and then I'm going to store the

762
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,400
traversable index that we used to find it.

763
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,000
And that's the p and X, right?

764
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
So now we're basically recording.

765
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,500
This is what the entity was standing on semantically.

766
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,800
This is what it is and we're passing that back.

767
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,100
Right?

768
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,200
So instead of a position in space for saying, this was the thing that

769
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,000
you were standing on.

770
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:37,900
Okay?

771
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,100
So now when we call that function, we're going to have to fix that.

772
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,700
What did I do?

773
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,300
Test entity.

774
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, that's right, that pointer and you as well, there we go.

775
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,700
So now in here when we have get closest reversible, we're not going to

776
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,300
anymore be getting a point.

777
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,900
Instead, we're going to be getting a thing that we should be standing.

778
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,200
On.

779
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,500
And so what I want to do is have a way of making that be be able to

780
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,400
generate a point.

781
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,300
So this closest P I'm still going to actually say is a thing that we

782
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,800
actually want but instead I'm going to have a traversable reference

783
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,200
here.

784
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Like so and I'm going to pass that.

785
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,000
And then assuming that we get into, we get to a point where we

786
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,100
actually found it.

787
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,900
Then I'm going to say closest P equals like get traversable in World

788
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,300
space kind of a thing, right?

789
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,200
Let me go ahead and see.

790
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I don't quite remember how we how we were phrasing that get SIM spaced

791
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,800
reversible, right?

792
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,300
I think that's what we wanted.

793
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:43,900
I'm not.

794
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,800
Why is it?

795
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,500
Why is that a

796
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,600
Double.

797
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,100
What?

798
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,600
What is what is that?

799
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,800
Let's just be honest, what is that?

800
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,900
I don't even understand what that is.

801
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,100
I want to know, oops.

802
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,400
So there's an image out, so I guess I guess it was just me providing

803
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,700
that there might be in the future, some more stuff there.

804
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,700
I guess.

805
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,400
So get some space traversable is all we really want.

806
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,400
I'm going to go ahead and say that it's this traversable index.

807
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,500
And you know what, I can probably get rid of the traversable index.

808
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,600
It seems like, I'm just gonna end up typing that all the time.

809
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Let's see here.

810
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,100
Where's the reference?

811
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,400
There it is.

812
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,500
I should probably also stack that up here.

813
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,400
So yeah, so we're going to say, get some space.

814
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,500
We're going to ask for that reversible.

815
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,200
But first, I got to clean this up because I decided I didn't want to

816
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,500
keep typing traversable again and again and again because it's a hard

817
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,300
word, you type.

818
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,500
Well, it's not that hard but you get the idea.

819
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,300
So it gets into space.

820
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,800
We need to pass it.

821
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,300
Watch the stem region.

822
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,900
We need to pass it.

823
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,400
The V3 of what

824
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,100
Go away.

825
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,500
Oh wait.

826
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,700
No that's that's not right.

827
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,200
It's just the entity, the index.

828
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,300
So I literally just say exactly what's here.

829
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:44,000
In fact, what I can do is just make it so that there's a thunk which

830
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,900
would do exactly what I want because it's literally just a call to

831
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,500
this, right?

832
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:54,500
So if I say gets in space traversable and just pass it a traversable

833
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,200
reference,

834
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,900
Then we would just do.

835
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,200
The thunk.

836
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,800
Manuel currying.

837
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,400
Well, not really but you get the idea.

838
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,600
All right, so any traversable point results,

839
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,900
And so that is now allowing us to basically translate this code

840
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,700
without really changing anything.

841
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:30,500
Right so okay so off we go, we gotta pass the address of that although

842
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,800
I suppose we don't really actually know what I think about that's

843
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
going to be an inline function.

844
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,900
There's no point in really passing the address, we might as well just

845
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:42,400
pass it directly give the optimizer less work to do.

846
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,400
Alright so here we are getting our sins face

847
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,900
First of all, we only want the P value out of it because right now is

848
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,200
nothing else in it and future maybe we do something else.

849
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,200
In this case we're still going to do exactly the same thing

850
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,100
traversable reference, reversible.

851
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,300
I'm going to go ahead and grab that.

852
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,300
Out.

853
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,900
And then I'm going to say, if found I'll grab the closest to pee,

854
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,700
And there's the traversable.

855
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,600
As we come through here, eventually then we're going to get to the

856
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,700
part where we oops pee in there.

857
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,000
We're gonna get to the part where we need to start storing it.

858
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,300
So now when we do editing move from and then they move to in this

859
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,000
case, now we just have to take whatever thing we were standing on and

860
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,800
and write that down as are from.

861
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,300
And then our move to is now just a traversable that we found before.

862
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,500
Right, so that's pretty easy.

863
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,400
So this is our only fellow who is somewhat problematic here.

864
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,500
So we're going to have to deal with that one in a second.

865
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,400
Now, when we get to movement from and movement to, you can see that

866
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:54,700
here.

867
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,000
And here, we're using them as actual positions.

868
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,600
So what we're going to have to do is essentially ask right movement

869
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,400
from is going to have to be a get some space traversable for my entity

870
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
movement from

871
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,500
Right, and I'm going to have to do.

872
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,000
This operation.

873
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,300
So I'm going to do any movement from when I get this in space

874
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:24,500
traversable and then I will now be able to use it as a position,

875
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,200
right?

876
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,600
And the same thing is going to be true.

877
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,800
Here course, I gotta do the psoas.

878
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,900
Same thing is going to be true here when we're about to, like, lock

879
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:37,900
the movement to the movement too well, and I guess I should also do

880
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,700
movement.

881
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
When I do movement to, I want the exact same thing.

882
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,300
And what I can do here is I can just make these be things, we grab

883
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,800
when we're in the hopping mode because we know that we need them,

884
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,400
right?

885
00:53:59,600 --> 00:53:59,800
And then

886
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Where that we were using them.

887
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:02,800
We just use them that way, bear now.

888
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,600
So really, our only problem now is we're not actually tracking the

889
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,600
traversable, we're actually on.

890
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,200
That's not really a huge problem, obviously, because we're saying that

891
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,200
now things need to know that if you're a Hopping kind of a guy, you

892
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,600
would need to know where you were, so that should be down to our only

893
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,900
error at this point.

894
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,500
I think, right?

895
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,500
So that's the only thing that we have to do.

896
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,700
So let's take a look at how we're going to do that for the entity.

897
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,000
Right.

898
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,600
Here's our kind of our movement code, starting to shake shape for

899
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,400
people who do hopping sorts of stuff.

900
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,100
I'm going to do at revert traversable reference the movement from

901
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,700
movement to, I guess to some degree.

902
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,800
We don't we can maybe talk about this in a different way.

903
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,500
So instead of movement from movement to what we could say now is

904
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,600
instead of that will just say, you know,

905
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,600
Standing on and moving to.

906
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,200
Let's say, right?

907
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,200
So in here will change these two standing on.

908
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,000
And moving to.

909
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,900
And standing might be a bit of a stretch but we'll know what we mean.

910
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:33,900
Because now we don't ever need to think about this other than just

911
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,000
thinking of it as we always have a value there.

912
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,300
So when we jump from one place to another, all we're setting is our

913
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,700
movement to we're not actually ever setting are standing on because

914
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,000
that's always going to be tracked and then when we set our entity P

915
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,900
here the entity P, yes, it was set to move into but we'll also set our

916
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,900
standing on right to be movement to as well.

917
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,500
The wrong movement to

918
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,600
Right.

919
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,400
And this is again, we're taking steps to set the stage for that

920
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,200
transactional process because you can see the transaction happening,

921
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,500
right here, right?

922
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,300
We're already starting to say, okay, we're taking our movement to it

923
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,900
making, it are standing on, right?

924
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,200
We can't do it this way because this is, there's no guarantee that

925
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,200
that thing is always available.

926
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,600
So this is the part that will slowly start to come out into a system

927
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,400
that allows us to do that transactionally, right?

928
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,800
So you can kind of see where I'm trying to go.

929
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,300
That where I'm trying to get it down to a thing where we do exactly.

930
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,600
The kind of transaction that I was talking about, but just not in a

931
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,500
centralized way, and then will centralize it.

932
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,500
So, here we go with our movement to movement from.

933
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:42,500
That's got to be standing on and moving to

934
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,200
Oops, and I forgot that they're moving to, right?

935
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,200
And now we have no errors but we have no errors.

936
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,700
We do have a problem and our problem is that when we initialize our

937
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,900
entity, we don't actually put it in.

938
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,100
Particular position.

939
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,200
And that's a problem.

940
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,800
Now, if we're saying the enemies always have to occupy a particular

941
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,600
Square, what that means is we're going to have to actually remember

942
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,400
when we create points and put the hero on.

943
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Say, a particular point, when they are created, we can't just

944
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,800
willy-nilly, you know, throw the hero down somewhere, inspect that, to

945
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,300
be useful because it's not going to be.

946
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:35,900
So what we need to do now is say, well, when we create this, you know,

947
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,200
there's two ways, we could do it one is, we could just say, oh, if

948
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:38,800
he's not on one,

949
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:39,900
A close one.

950
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,600
I want to make sure it's we're going to go transaction with this.

951
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,500
I want to make sure that when people are created, they had to be

952
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,100
created.

953
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,600
If there's somebody who moves around in that fashion, they have to be

954
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:51,900
created in a way that allows them to start out valid.

955
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,100
I don't want them to start invalid that make sense, although they are

956
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,600
invalid in the sense that they have no arms and legs.

957
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,200
What can I say?

958
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,800
Alright, so here we are in add player when we call add player.

959
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,800
I guess what I'm saying here is that I want you to have to give it a

960
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,500
traversable reference, which is the location.

961
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,500
And so there's yeah there's a couple things here.

962
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,600
One is that again that P the world position of the thing.

963
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't know if we want to start making that be an offset from

964
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,500
whatever traversable it's located on I'm not sure.

965
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,300
Hard to say.

966
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,000
That's something, we'll have to start thinking about.

967
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,300
But anyway, so in here, where we create these, these fellows, the

968
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:38,800
body.

969
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,000
Who's the one that has to hop around, we're going to have to say, hey,

970
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,900
the body, its location has to be, I'm sorry.

971
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,800
I guess I could call the standing on.

972
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,900
It's standing on is going to be whatever we say it is, right?

973
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,300
And so then you here when we do an ad player and you know if the

974
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,900
button is pressed and we have to add a player, we need to find a place

975
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:13,900
where we can actually put this player and so we need to do that when

976
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,400
we actually have a SIM region open now I'll be honest.

977
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,000
I don't know why we process the controllers before we open the same

978
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,500
region.

979
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,800
I do not have any

980
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,400
Dear.

981
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,900
I suppose we probably had a reason for that.

982
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,300
I don't know what it was but it's not great.

983
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,000
What I'd rather do is move it right below there.

984
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,900
So that bright before we do anything else, we go ahead and process the

985
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:38,700
controller input.

986
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,300
I don't see why we couldn't do that.

987
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,200
So I'm going to do that.

988
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,600
All right, so what I'm going to do here and this is kind of janky,

989
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,500
we're going to have to do something a little smarter than this

990
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:51,400
eventually is I'm just going to say, okay, let's scan for the closest

991
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,800
reversible to wear.

992
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,400
Wherever the camera is and stick the player on that.

993
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,800
Right, like I said, not perfect.

994
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,100
Reason that this would not work in the game per se is we will probably

995
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,100
have to have some kind of additional information about whether or not

996
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,900
you could ever get to where you're going.

997
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,300
And so probably what will happen is when you first start the game will

998
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,900
put that player to known location and then from then on whenever

999
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:20,800
players join we will search for traversable that are connected to

1000
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,600
where the current player is.

1001
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:27,000
So that we don't like, stick somebody off in a wall are off area, they

1002
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,800
can't get out of right, that's not a very fun gameplay experience.

1003
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,500
It's you know, unless you're like Assassin's Creed or something and

1004
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,000
you just want people to be like inside walls and stuff.

1005
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,700
So at this point what we do when we do add player is we just sort of

1006
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,100
drop him down instead, what we're going to do is I'm going to call get

1007
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,800
closest reversible and if assuming that it succeeds, then I'll put the

1008
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,400
thing down.

1009
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,700
If not, then we'll probably do like, you know, to do here.

1010
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,100
That's like game UI that tells you there's no.

1011
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:07,400
No safe place, maybe keep trying on subsequent frames you know like

1012
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,700
okay we acknowledge you hit the start button and we're just looking

1013
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,300
for a place to put you you know maybe that's a thing that happens.

1014
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:13,900
I don't know.

1015
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:17,300
That's sort of a late-stage game thing that we can worry about later.

1016
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,400
If we ever decide to actually let multiple people play in the shipping

1017
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,000
version of the game.

1018
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,500
Anyway, I don't know that we want that, but

1019
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,800
So anyway, if I called get closest reversible, I'm just going to say

1020
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,900
wherever the camera is.

1021
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,600
So here's the camera, right?

1022
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,900
That's the camera location.

1023
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,900
So just give me the closest, reversible, the camera, drop it there.

1024
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,800
So, it does not take two arguments, right?

1025
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,600
You are sir, I actually need traversable.

1026
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,200
Better.

1027
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,900
And so now, let's see what we have wrought, who knows, right?

1028
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,700
So we've added a player at this point.

1029
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,100
Interesting.

1030
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,000
I have a question.

1031
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:30,800
Is that the only yet is okay.

1032
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,100
So in theory,

1033
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:41,600
In theory, we have placed the hero at a reasonable traversable for

1034
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,400
this start, I guess.

1035
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:50,000
But not, when we must not set it when we do our hop because it looks

1036
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,800
like it's working up till that point, but I'm not sure we'll see.

1037
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,300
So, anyway, is this working or is it not?

1038
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,400
Well, if it didn't find it reversible.

1039
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,800
So it must be setting it because it didn't

1040
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,700
Reversible didn't hear it.

1041
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Then it wouldn't.

1042
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,400
It would never have created The Entity, right?

1043
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,700
We would never add the player.

1044
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,000
So we should be in a situation where only are hopping is problematic.

1045
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,800
We're setting our movement to to the traversable that we found up

1046
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,300
here.

1047
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,800
Presumably, we found one.

1048
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,400
I guess it's possible that we didn't find one, but, you know, this

1049
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,100
this Boolean should have prevented that case.

1050
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,900
So we should always be talking about a very valid traversable that

1051
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:34,400
we're setting with moving to and standing on was already set.

1052
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,100
So when we get into hopping, I

1053
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,100
You like both standing on and moving to should have been valid and

1054
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,900
should have worked.

1055
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,000
But obviously they didn't because we're getting an assertion that it's

1056
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,900
trying to look up at verse 12, it doesn't exist.

1057
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,700
So I guess the first thing we have to do is just figure out how did

1058
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,300
that happen?

1059
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,900
And I don't know, let's find out.

1060
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,200
First things first, which one is it?

1061
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:01,700
So it's are moving.

1062
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,100
Its our movement to oh wait these are reversed.

1063
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,100
All right, so this has nothing to do with the bug.

1064
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,900
But before we go any further, let's not forget to put these in the

1065
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:12,800
right order.

1066
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,700
Right.

1067
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,500
Moving to this is moving to this is standing on.

1068
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,400
So let's there we go.

1069
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,600
Got to fix that texture stuff.

1070
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,500
It's just never a good time for it.

1071
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,300
All right, so the one that we are having a problem with

1072
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,800
is apparently standing on because it's not set to anything.

1073
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:47,900
Right.

1074
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,100
So at some point are standing on, didn't get set to anything.

1075
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,100
I don't know when that is, it may be that the standing on was not

1076
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,700
actually initialized properly, but that just seems kind of weird.

1077
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,900
I don't know if that's true or not, but we should verify that.

1078
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,400
Let me go back and see, maybe it's just a question of add player being

1079
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:04,900
broken.

1080
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,300
You can see body standing on getting set here right here.

1081
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,900
And so I'm not sure why we would be having trouble with that.

1082
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,900
But I'm going to go ahead and step in there and see what happened.

1083
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,200
So here's where we add the player.

1084
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,200
I'm coming through here and I'm setting standing on.

1085
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,700
So what is standing on set to?

1086
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:33,400
It's obviously valid right and and so in here where we where we set

1087
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,800
it, the bodies standing on

1088
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,900
There it is and moving to as well but that's what we would expect,

1089
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:42,800
right?

1090
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,400
So now if that's what it's set to, if that's what it's up to you in

1091
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,300
the head I'm going to jump down to 08 rather the body.

1092
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,100
When I come in here, I'm going to want to see and verify that that's

1093
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,800
actually still true.

1094
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,600
So, here's the head.

1095
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,600
Here is the standing on here is the moving to and they are both know

1096
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,900
that is not reassuring.

1097
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,800
Not reassuring.

1098
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,900
I am not reassured by that.

1099
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,000
I feel not reassured.

1100
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,500
So what happened there?

1101
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,700
Let's go ahead and step back into a player and see is our packing

1102
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,900
messed up, because it could very well be

1103
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,400
There's the head.

1104
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,300
Here comes the body.

1105
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:34,800
Okay?

1106
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,000
So what we're going to do here obviously, doing our little dance to

1107
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,100
pack into the world.

1108
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,700
We set the P.

1109
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,300
That doesn't matter back any into into World.

1110
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,000
Here we go.

1111
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,100
And now we're copying it into the chunk.

1112
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:58,100
oh,

1113
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,300
Wait.

1114
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,000
So this is busted, I guess, I forgot to finish this code.

1115
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,400
This is that's a massive oversight.

1116
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:18,600
Obviously, so yeah, that's just garbage.

1117
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:23,100
This stuff is supposed to be done in pack entity into world, right?

1118
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:26,600
All of these things have to be done when we do the packing that's

1119
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,300
obvious, all like packing has to Encompass all of the things and we

1120
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,000
weren't doing that.

1121
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,600
So we were never actually converting that to a valid value, so that's

1122
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,000
just complete nonsense.

1123
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,900
Hopefully, you saw what was happening there.

1124
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:42,300
I'll describe in a second just in case you missed it but let's go

1125
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:42,500
ahead.

1126
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,800
And fix that first.

1127
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,300
So when we do pack em in the world, I'm sorry packing in chunk.

1128
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,600
That's when we have to do all of our edits to it.

1129
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,100
Right.

1130
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,400
So here where we do our are Stardust equals Source.

1131
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,200
This is where we have to actually do the storage, right?

1132
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,600
So it's really that starting to be desk here.

1133
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,800
I'm going to actually do any of these star desti or something like

1134
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,500
that, which I will.

1135
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,000
Set up that way.

1136
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,700
But yeah, this this packing has to happen at store time.

1137
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:22,300
That's you can't not pack when you create because all the same logic

1138
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,000
has to occur.

1139
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,100
So that was just dumb.

1140
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,600
I don't know why that worked.

1141
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,600
Yeah, I don't know why that worked at all.

1142
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,200
That's just really weird.

1143
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,899
In fact, if you think about it, our AB player stuff is actually kind

1144
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,500
of a little bit busted in that case, too.

1145
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,500
Because we should always be creating in the ungh in, you know, in the

1146
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,800
in the expanded space and packing down.

1147
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,899
And so when we do add player,

1148
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,100
Add anything really?

1149
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,300
Oops.

1150
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,000
I mean we'll do when we do add player.

1151
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,399
Obviously in here really, we should not be setting, indices right?

1152
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:16,600
These should just be set to pointers and then they get packed.

1153
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,500
Two IDs during the storage process, right?

1154
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,800
So these are really pack, and those are going to be pulled.

1155
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,300
Out of the same region and into the world code because that's how the

1156
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,100
packing works.

1157
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:34,600
Right.

1158
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,899
Really, I should merge the Sim region and The Sims storage eventually.

1159
01:09:40,899 --> 01:09:43,500
Probably, because they're so tightly coupled.

1160
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,100
I don't think there's any point in keeping them separate, but for now,

1161
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,500
it doesn't really matter.

1162
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,400
All right, so that should be a lot better now that's actually going

1163
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,600
through the correct code path.

1164
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,500
And hey, now I can hop around right.

1165
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:19,700
So that's good and again so now we can also sort of say well, you

1166
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,900
know, if that's the information about where the person is 2 then

1167
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:28,300
during standing I could also say that he always recovers whatever his

1168
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,600
position would have been, right?

1169
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,900
And I don't know exactly how we want this to work eventually but I'm

1170
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,200
just sort of giving you what the idea is here.

1171
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,700
If we go down to the hero head code or sorry, Hiro body code,

1172
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,300
Then when you are planted, what we will actually do is we will still

1173
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,900
assign you to your location, right?

1174
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,700
So we'll still say, oh, your entity P, we're always going to move you

1175
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,300
to wherever you were supposed to be standing.

1176
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:02,600
Right?

1177
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,100
And so that doesn't do anything at the moment, obviously?

1178
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,000
Right?

1179
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:13,200
That doesn't do anything in particular here, but if we had something

1180
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:13,400
here,

1181
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,000
You could ride on right?

1182
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,500
Like a, you know, some kind of an object you could move around on.

1183
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So for example, let's say we go up to one of these things where we do

1184
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,800
you know, as standard room or whatever.

1185
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,900
If we have this as standard room thing and we're like well, okay, you

1186
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:37,200
know, we want a thing that's going to be basically the same as

1187
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:42,700
something that you stand on here, but instead of any type floor or

1188
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:47,400
whatever this is going to be entity type, well actually I don't even

1189
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,700
know this is entity type.

1190
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,000
Entity type.

1191
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:00,600
Lodi.

1192
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,600
Thing for now.

1193
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:12,600
So we're going to have an ad floaty thing call because like you do,

1194
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,900
and then we're going to add the floaty thing.

1195
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:30,900
Yeah, and it's got the floor Collision will say it.

1196
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:36,300
Doesn't do any special colliding and that's just how it goes.

1197
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,400
Okay, so now we can add floaty things and the only reason I wanted to

1198
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:46,100
do that was because now, when we look at any type floor and what it

1199
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,600
does, right, we've got this rendering here, I'm going to say that also

1200
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,500
will do that for a type floaty thing.

1201
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,400
And by the way, these are not

1202
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,000
Types are going away.

1203
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,700
Why can't I complete that?

1204
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,600
What did I do wrong?

1205
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,000
There we go.

1206
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,100
I think I may have accidentally

1207
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,500
I deleted that line.

1208
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,000
Yeah, I did.

1209
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,500
All right, so if I have one of these floaty things for now, you know

1210
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,700
and I do as standard room over here.

1211
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:35,200
What I could do is say all right, let's also add a floaty thing.

1212
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:36,900
Oops.

1213
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,200
We'll add a floaty thing.

1214
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:47,800
World mode and I'll just say, like whatever this would have been.

1215
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:54,200
So you know, like oops.

1216
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,900
Where we'll do it is we'll just say like if tile I don't know why

1217
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,200
we're still doing this this way instead of just passing the thing.

1218
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,300
It's don't even ask me.

1219
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:13,200
I don't know if tile x equals what like seven and tile.

1220
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,400
Y equals 7 equals 4.

1221
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:16,900
I don't know.

1222
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,400
We'll add a floaty thing.

1223
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:33,200
So now in theory, there is a floating thing, right?

1224
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:33,700
Can't see it.

1225
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:37,300
But in theory, there is what and so now in fact, you can see it there,

1226
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,700
there that's stacked up right there.

1227
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,600
And so now, if we were to take that floaty thing and make the floaty

1228
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
thing move, right?

1229
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,200
So in floor, we don't have any logic for floor, but we can now make

1230
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,500
some logic in here for floaty thing.

1231
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,900
If it was to sort of, you know, move itself around what I could do, is

1232
01:14:58,900 --> 01:14:59,200
say,

1233
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,900
You know, the air.

1234
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,900
It's edit epz is going to be equal to, you know, I don't know.

1235
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,500
Who knows the sign of something?

1236
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,500
The sign of the frame time.

1237
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,000
Howdy Bob

1238
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,500
It's T-Bob, right?

1239
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,300
So we just we say like, okay.

1240
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,500
So, we just say entity T-Bob.

1241
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,300
Plus equals V T, something like that.

1242
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,800
And we make it, you know, go up and down by by quite a bit.

1243
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,400
Right.

1244
01:15:56,900 --> 01:16:03,300
So now with that going up and down right in theory I can I can get oh

1245
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:03,800
dear

1246
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,900
I guess he doesn't ever think he gets to it.

1247
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,900
I'm not sure why he's hopping like that.

1248
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,500
Like, why does he keep popping?

1249
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,500
That was quite dramatic.

1250
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,500
What's our code for stopping hopping?

1251
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,800
I thought it was just time based.

1252
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:26,800
Oh, it's because the head picks a different closest point.

1253
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,200
Yeah, that'll be kind of interesting.

1254
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,500
Let's, let's make that a little less dramatic.

1255
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,400
Okay, so in a standard room, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to

1256
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,500
say in here instead of adding the ground identity floor Collision, I'm

1257
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,500
going to actually do an if and switch which one of them I'm doing.

1258
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:14,400
So I'm going to say oh okay if my you know if the offset x equals 0 or

1259
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:20,700
rather equals, let's say 2 and the offset y equals 2 then I'll make a

1260
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,900
floaty thing instead of the ground.

1261
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,300
So it should be relatively unambiguous now so are broken.

1262
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,800
You know, controller code won't have a cow about that, right?

1263
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,300
Although where is our floaty thing floaty thing.

1264
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:43,300
Where did you go?

1265
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:44,600
Oops.

1266
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,000
Tell you what?

1267
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,300
Forget the floaty thing.

1268
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,600
Just add it this way.

1269
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:01,000
There we go.

1270
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:06,800
Okay.

1271
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,300
Okay, that is just weird.

1272
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,300
This is going to have to be tomorrow's bug to search for.

1273
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,200
I don't understand why we would be getting that.

1274
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,200
Because why is he thinking needs to hop?

1275
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,800
The Hop code is not based on the distance, right?

1276
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,300
I just maybe you shouldn't ever hop to the same point, right?

1277
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:40,800
I guess we kind of need to say that this happens prior to the search

1278
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,200
that's I guess all we really need.

1279
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,700
We would just say if entity movement mode

1280
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,600
Equals movement mode planted then we need to update it before we

1281
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,100
search, right?

1282
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,300
So that that that's my bad.

1283
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:05,400
So, there we go.

1284
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,200
And you can see now we still have problems because we're still looking

1285
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,400
for whatever the closest thing to the head is so we still need to now

1286
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,900
rewrite our controller code with that knowledge of.

1287
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,700
We only jump when we move the head further away from the body, and

1288
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,100
then we pick because otherwise, every time we get nearer, there's one

1289
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,400
that's like closer to the head.

1290
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,000
It's going to like constantly try to jump back and forth between them,

1291
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,500
right?

1292
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,200
And that's like, definitely not what we want.

1293
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,600
So that's bad news.

1294
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,400
All right.

1295
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,200
I'll take a couple quick questions, but I got to go soon.

1296
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,100
Nibbler.

1297
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,700
That sounds like a job for hysteresis, photo.

1298
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:25,200
Shoot it, right?

1299
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,100
I guess.

1300
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,200
Sort of, in this case, really, it's more about the controller logic

1301
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
that we programmed was before.

1302
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:36,900
We had any concept of that, we were standing on traversable, so we

1303
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,800
were just saying whatever the closest thing is and so you're right.

1304
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,600
It is hysteresis is like we want to take into account what we meant,

1305
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,300
right?

1306
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,100
And so,

1307
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,800
As it's going to actually very easy to make that happen, and it's

1308
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,000
going to mean that the code for the head gets better too.

1309
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,100
The implemented a structured editor for greenfoot.

1310
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,700
I don't think I know what greenfoot is.

1311
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,500
Sure does look ugly but I don't know what greenfoot is.

1312
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,000
Kind of rents.

1313
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So we are planning to have the head detached forever.

1314
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,200
What does that mean?

1315
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,100
The head always moves separately from the body.

1316
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,700
And the body follows the head.

1317
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,600
graphically we will draw them as best we can to make it always appear

1318
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,400
like they're connected physically in the artistic sense but

1319
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,300
Abner where are the gloves?

1320
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,400
You'll programming custom glove movement, right?

1321
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,700
The glove is is actually like what you attack with.

1322
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,800
So that's going to not, you don't really move it so much as you just

1323
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,600
say when you're attacking with it.

1324
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,100
Colonel Dragon.

1325
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:31,100
Any idea when you plan on adding in the correct perspective, Arts with

1326
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,300
the hero looks less strange.

1327
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,900
No, because that's actually kind of held up as far as art as far as

1328
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,200
getting the artist concerned.

1329
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,500
Let's see.

1330
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,800
So in theory, you could test this by adding a second Hero Test.

1331
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,400
What?

1332
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:01,900
With the X, I can try making sure they don't sound the same tile, but

1333
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:03,300
we haven't implemented.

1334
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:06,200
Transactional tile stuff yet so they could easily stand in the same

1335
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:06,900
tile if they want to do.

1336
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,000
We're not preventing them.

1337
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:25,200
All right.

1338
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:26,600
I have to head out.

1339
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,300
So if there are questions that you want to know about on this holding

1340
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,800
for tomorrow and I will get to them then.

1341
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,900
All right, let's close this down.

1342
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,100
Okay, thank you very much for joining me for this episode of handmade

1343
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:43,300
hero.

1344
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,500
It's been a pleasure coding with you.

1345
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:48,100
As always, if you would like to follow along at home, you can always

1346
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,500
pray to the game.

1347
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,100
My Hand be here at our org and it comes with the source code so you

1348
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,700
can follow along and experiment with it.

1349
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,400
We also have a forum site, you can go to.

1350
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,700
If you want to ask questions, we have a patreon page from a sports

1351
01:23:59,700 --> 01:23:59,800
video.

1352
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,400
Is we have a schedule bot?

1353
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,800
If you would like to know what time the videos are going to be live,

1354
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,300
and we also have episode guide for try, catch up on old stuff, that's

1355
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:11,800
about it for today.

1356
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,300
I'll be back here for the last dream of this week tomorrow.

1357
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:14,800
5:00 p.m.

1358
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:20,000
Pacific Daylight time until then I will.

1359
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:21,600
Well I'll see you guys in the unit.

1360
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,400
Take it easy everyone.

1361
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,200
Yeah.

1362
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,800
Wait, this isn't good.

1363
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,300
Why does that say start recording?

1364
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,300
Did it not actually record.

1365
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:34,800
Hmm.

1366
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,500
Well that's a bummer.

1367
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,400
Looks like we're gonna have to get this one from twitch because it

1368
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,900
doesn't look like it restarted recording.

1369
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:43,800
Oh well.

1370
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,500
I heard us with such a passion.

1371
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,700
Well, Alex were different witch.
