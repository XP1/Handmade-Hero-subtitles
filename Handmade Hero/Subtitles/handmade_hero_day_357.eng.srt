00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,500
The show recode a complete game live on stream, you know, I just

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,400
wanted to take a quick second before, starting today's stream to point

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:20,100
out that the, the folks who provide the forums for handmade hero,

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,000
which is handmade Network who actually provide the forums for a lot of

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,200
projects that are hand coded.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
They have finally added something that I know that they

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,200
You have been wind out for a while, but I think they wanted to make

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,100
sure that they had a good procedure in place for handling such things

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,400
before they opened it up.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,700
But they decided to open up their project submissions for anyone who

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,500
was interested in having a project hosted there.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,200
And you can see that if you go here to handmade Network / projects, or

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,600
you can just go to handmade Network and click on this projects button

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,400
and that page lists all the projects that they're

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,000
There are but previously you know, if you wanted to be part of their

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,400
project hosting you had to email someone involved with the site and

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,100
ask them to add you because they didn't again have it set up yet for

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,600
public submission but they've finished all the stuff they wanted to do

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
for public submissions.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,000
So now you can do a really handy quick submission process.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
If you haven't registered for the site yet which of course on this

23
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,800
browser, I haven't

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,400
I am registered on the site because there's our project right here, if

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,000
you haven't, you just register first to make a username and, you know,

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you might already have one of those because you may participate in the

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,600
forums here.

28
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,200
But if you don't have one, you just register appear.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,800
And then this register, or login, B will change to a submission

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,100
button.

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,000
You can click and then you can send the information about your project

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,700
and they will take a look.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,000
So yeah, if you're interested in doing a handmade project and by

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,400
handmade project, I mean I think one of the interesting things about

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,000
handmade project is certainly I never attempted to Define what

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,300
handmade project meant and I don't know that anyone really knows what

37
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,800
it means because it wasn't supposed to be a name for anything.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,900
It was just the name of this particular series, and now it carries a

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
lot of connotations I suppose where that that are different from

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,000
person to person.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,400
But in general I think it you know, just kind of means if you are

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,200
Who's interested in programming and you know, learning about

43
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,500
programming and doing programming in a dedicated way where you

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,000
actually care about the results and you care about what's going on.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,500
I feel like that probably slots in here and if you look at the kind of

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,600
projects that are in here, they're pretty varied.

47
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,100
They're not specific to games or anything.

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,400
So, for example, for coder is the editor we use on stream and that was

49
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,700
Handmade by Allen Webster handmade here obviously, is the show you're

50
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,100
watching motion box is a

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
New browser.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,900
Only enough, which is kind of so like totally not game related, but

53
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,700
it's designed to just browse videos like, that's all it does, is

54
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,500
browse videos.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,900
So, it's kind of like meant to be sort of, like, a new way of

56
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,200
thinking, about Television, right?

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,100
And a lot of people really like this.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,900
I've heard a lot of positive things about it, so you know, again,

59
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,600
completely unrelated to video games or the original product in any

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,800
way.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,000
But it's just like part of the sort of idea that, you know, building

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
things and caring about them is good.

63
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,300
And then there's papaya which is a image editor, right?

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,600
Like a painting program, there's a a game engine kind of thing like a

65
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,100
not a game engine necessarily meant for, like shipping commercial

66
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,600
games, but a game engine that's made to, so that you can learn how to

67
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,300
program video games.

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,400
It's like a teaching engine.

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,600
If you will, obviously, Sean Barrett's, fabulous collection of

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,800
libraries that a lot of people already use their now hosted on here

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,700
and, you know, the list kind of goes on and on here.

72
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,100
And

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
They've built up a pretty impressive list.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There's even people who are working on new debugging tools and that's

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,400
going to be kind of awesome because I've always wanted to switch away

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
from the debugging tools that I have.

77
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,500
Currently I don't love them.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,300
And so you know much like we switch to for coder because I really

79
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,700
didn't love emacs and I'm much happier on for coder.

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,600
I think maybe you know the day might come when we get to switch from

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
Visual Studio on stream.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
I've never really been a big fan of using

83
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000
For debugging to one of the buggers that people are building here,

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,700
which you know, would probably be more focused towards kind of

85
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,500
debugging that we do.

86
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:32,700
Right?

87
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,000
Visual Studios is geared towards a very broad, you know, audience of

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,800
people that doesn't really necessarily have even program in C++,

89
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,400
right?

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,400
And so a lot of times the focus on that debugger is elsewhere and so

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,800
you know it might be that one of the debugger is made here will focus

92
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,100
more on the kinds of stuff that we do.

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,800
So there's all sorts of stuff here.

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,200
Of course.

95
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
10 is the paint program, we use on stream as well.

96
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,300
So that got written under the handmade Network Banner as well.

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,700
So there's just a lot of great projects on here.

98
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,900
And, you know, even if you're not thinking of starting a project, you

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,000
should probably check out the products that are on here because a lot

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,200
of them also provide source code so you can learn from them as well

101
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,000
and if a lot of them also accept either donations or our commercial so

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,100
you can purchase them.

103
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,400
So if it's a project that you want to support that would be a great

104
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
thing to do because obviously

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,100
the folks who are building these things could you know they've got to

106
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,600
eat too.

107
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,600
So yeah all this stuff is pretty cool I would definitely recommend

108
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,100
checking it out and if you do have a project that you think you would

109
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,500
like to be part of the community that they're working on at handmade

110
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,300
Network and the sort of stuff that they're doing, that's the news

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,600
right?

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,700
The the submit a project button is up and they are they're ready to

113
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,300
start looking at at folks who have projects who might want to host on

114
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:54,600
here.

115
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,700
So, give that a shot.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,500
And made Network / projects and yeah, the folks on the chat Abner and

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Abner coimbra and Andrew chronister and joroan.

118
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,000
That's let's see.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,200
That's it's just Abner coin, brave for usernames, Chrono dragon and

120
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,800
and Colombian on the chat I believe do.

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,600
Most of the site works.

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,900
So if you have any questions about that and or you have any

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,900
Abel submitting your project because again this is a brand-new

124
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,600
feature, check them.

125
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,800
Check them out on chat.

126
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,900
They're oftentimes on during handmade hero so you can find them in the

127
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,500
twitch chat or on the handmade RC or you can also if you registered a

128
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,200
username you can go to the forums here and there's a site feedback you

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,100
just from the handmade Network main site.

130
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,100
You can just click on this forums button and that forms button will

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,800
bring you to like a place where you can post questions.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Or if you're having trouble with the site or this, just something

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,600
about the site that didn't work, the way you thought, that's a good

134
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,100
place to let them know so they can be aware of it as, you know, I'm

135
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
sure you're aware with web development.

136
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,200
A lot of times things are different on different browsers or different

137
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
things happen that are confusing.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And, you know, they might not know about the issue that you're seeing

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,300
or they may not be aware that there's some problem with a specific

140
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,500
configuration or whatever you're doing.

141
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,600
So if you're having any trouble that's the place to go as well.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,600
And again, if for some reason, you can't even register because of

143
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
something in your area or whatever is happening, check them out on

144
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,500
chat and and they can help you out.

145
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Alright, so that's about it, we are ready to get started here.

146
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,100
I don't know why this isn't showing I guess because it didn't get

147
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,000
reopened the other yesterday.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,800
I pushed the clang compatibility.

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,300
Well push his father Edward I

150
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Did the work on the clan compatibility stuff but I don't know why it's

151
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
not on here because I closed it but I thought it got reopened because

152
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,700
some folks did do the testing on it and there was one other thing that

153
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,500
we needed to fix when they tried to compile it.

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,200
Now I don't know why that's not on here.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,300
That's a good question because these are sorted by date.

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,900
Are they not?

157
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:35,700
So it should have been right up here but I don't actually see it now.

158
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,299
Maybe it's because it didn't get recorded in here for some reason.

159
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm not sure.

160
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,200
Or maybe the notifications page would tell me.

161
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,799
Here we go.

162
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
So why?

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,300
Why was that not?

164
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,300
I don't know.

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,300
Anyway, all I can say is we found it will just consider that a victory

166
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,800
there, a little, a little minor GitHub Victory and we'll just

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,500
With that.

168
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
So okay, here was the actual thing I want to talk about.

169
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,600
So this is the, the fellow who actually, I believe continues to

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,600
maintain an sdl port in the GitHub as well, you know, for handmade

171
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:14,700
hero.

172
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,600
So he compiles it on

173
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,300
On clang all the time and Martin's and and and him were the two people

174
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,000
who basically gave me all of the information I needed in order to fix

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,400
the build under clang.

176
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,900
So, he went ahead and tested it.

177
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,900
And apparently the problem now is confined to just the time function

178
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,600
macro and it has to do with the fact that the, the care that the

179
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,500
function is declared.

180
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,000
As const the the function string.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,100
So we need to Cast Away the const so that we don't have a compiler

182
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,500
error there.

183
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,100
When you pass it to the time clock function, but the other thing is, I

184
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,700
guess we weren't properly passing the counter or something.

185
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
So I got to go take a look at that as well.

186
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
That may just been a mistake on my part.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,700
I'm not sure why that didn't fail in our build, but there's probably a

188
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
good reason for it.

189
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
So we'll take a look at that as well.

190
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,900
And

191
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:29,100
It looks like there was some problem with GCC where the macro

192
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:37,500
expansion leaves a comma incorrectly, which I'm not sure why.

193
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,500
Because, I thought that double paste thing was supposed to be the way

194
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,800
that that gets fixed, but I don't even know if that.

195
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,500
Double Pace thing is standardized or not, that may have just been a

196
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,200
convention for not having

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,700
The comma or I don't really know.

198
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,800
But yeah, that is just a generic thing that I use when I end macros in

199
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,400
general to make sure that they can pass through more information if

200
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,200
necessary.

201
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,200
And that just to give some perspective on that, the reason I do that

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,300
is because then if the underlying function, that the macro calls adds

203
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,700
new optional parameters at the end, it'll still work without having to

204
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,600
change the macro.

205
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,300
So I typically just do it that way, but as Kim's pointing out,

206
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,700
Here, we don't actually use that.

207
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,600
We don't, we have never needed to pass additional arguments.

208
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,600
So at least for the time being, and probably for the foreseeable

209
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,300
future, because time function, I did never really envisioned it,

210
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,100
taking more parameters.

211
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,200
Anyway, that's just, like I said, more of a thing that I just do in

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,700
general when I make macros.

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
So there's really no reason, we can't eliminate it.

214
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,900
So the fact that there's that extra spurious comma getting inserted by

215
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
GCC.

216
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,200
We can work around that in exactly the way that chemists suggesting

217
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,700
here.

218
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,200
Basically that vet by removing that our VA aren't entirely, then we

219
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,300
won't have the problem.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,300
So let's just go ahead and do that.

221
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Again, it only

222
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
A few minutes to even do.

223
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,900
It's a very very simple change.

224
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,300
We did all the sort of actual work that it was necessary for this

225
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,400
yesterday.

226
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,700
So it's pretty easy.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I just go and compile the the project here to make sure

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,200
everything's set up properly in if I jump back to the GitHub and look

229
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,300
here you can see it's just the time function thing, we know that

230
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,800
that's in debug interface and so we'll just jump down to it.

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Here's time function.

232
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,800
And if you take a look at what's going on in time function, again, you

233
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
can see that it's just really something that's getting passed down to

234
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
the timed block, right?

235
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,200
You can see the time block here and here is that timed block function,

236
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,500
you can see the hit count in it, right?

237
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,100
Which is there, which is to record a single hit, and as you can see,

238
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,500
we're not using that anymore.

239
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,700
And so, this is what I saying about, you know, we don't really need

240
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,300
that that aspect of the matter,

241
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Anymore.

242
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,600
So we can just get rid of it for now, if we find that we needed again,

243
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,700
well, we'll have to think about that and deal with it when the time

244
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
comes right.

245
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,300
For now, we might as well maintained GCC compatibility because that's

246
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,200
the only thing stopping us from getting that.

247
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
So if we take this out of the time function, right, and you can see us

248
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,600
passing this, this information here.

249
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,300
When we call the timed block, we're supposed to pass a grid, a name

250
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,900
and a number.

251
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,300
Now, I don't know why we were able to not pass that number here.

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,700
That's a really good question.

253
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,400
And I guess it's just because the number isn't getting used right.

254
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,700
You can kind of see that the number just isn't getting used, so it

255
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,200
looks like that number was actually getting past as the hit count,

256
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,500
which was just getting ignored.

257
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,800
So I think this is just Legacy code anyway.

258
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,700
So I suspect, what we can probably do is just say like, okay, timed

259
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,800
block really just takes a grid and a name and that's all it does,

260
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,500
right?

261
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,500
The counter is not necessary at all.

262
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,100
Neither are the variable arguments because they're all they're going

263
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
to do is end up getting past the time block, which we already know we

264
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,100
do need, right?

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,100
So, if you take a look at what's going on here, we could just say like

266
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,200
okay you know, if we just want to leave this as simple as possible,

267
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,000
which you might as well.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
Do at the moment, we can always make it more complicated later, right?

269
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,300
No, no programmer ever was like, oh, I can't make that more

270
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
complicated for you.

271
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,800
So if we just go ahead and get rid of sort of the vestigial remains

272
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,700
there, then we're left with

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,100
Thing that will probably be able to compile properly on all the

274
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,300
platforms, right?

275
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,900
And so, I think, what we probably want to do is say well, okay, since

276
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,100
name just gets replicated multiple times here, probably when we do

277
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,000
timed block, we just pass a name and then we replicate it twice all

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,700
the other aspects that we use.

279
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,300
We're going to go ahead and use sort of the grid expansion version of

280
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,800
them here.

281
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,700
And then when we call a Time function by itself, for just going to

282
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
pass function and function as the name.

283
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,400
Right.

284
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,200
And you can imagine it's just calling timed block here with because it

285
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,900
would it with function as long as parameter.

286
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,800
But I'm not going to bother doing that because against

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
Trying to get this to compiler multi compilers and we have testing of

288
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,000
a current macro set.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,500
I don't want to like poke The Hornet's Nest there, any more than is

290
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
absolutely necessary.

291
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,000
So I feel like just trimming that out, we should be in better shape

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,100
now, and, you know, here's here's everything running, I believe

293
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,400
properly, and if I go to the profile, you can kind of see that our

294
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
names are still good.

295
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:25,700
Right?

296
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,300
There's there's nothing weird happening there with our time function

297
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:29,600
blocks.

298
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:29,800
These are

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,900
All timed functions.

300
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,800
So it looks like we're all good, right?

301
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,500
Everything seems fine there and so I think that's a change that we can

302
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,100
keep.

303
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,900
Now, like I said, I don't understand why this didn't show up there,

304
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,000
but it looks like because it's not, they didn't, it looks like Kim

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,600
didn't reopen the issue, it might be because he can't I don't know

306
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,400
what the rules are in.

307
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,600
Good of, it may be that I accidentally closed it in a way that it may

308
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,500
be the only I have the authority.

309
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
Because it's my project to reopen the issue, I'm not sure.

310
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,200
But anyway, I'll just write it here so he could see it.

311
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,700
And then I do get email notifications when people reply to these

312
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,500
issues streams.

313
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,100
And so, in that way, right?

314
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,800
I can know if there was an additional problem with it, even though

315
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
it's not listed as a open issue anymore.

316
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,500
Just build that row its vestigial, isn't it?

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,100
Yes, it is.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So now we've at least try to make this stuff work your and hopefully

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,900
that will now bring us into full compliance with all the compilers

320
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,300
that people use, clang, GCC and an MSP see.

321
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,300
No way to know without testing, we will certainly find out and we will

322
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,800
let the folks who use clang on a regular basis.

323
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,099
Let us know if everything is now working correctly for them or whether

324
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,300
there are still issues out there.

325
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,700
Okay so today I guess I'm not exactly sure what we want to do today.

326
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,300
I was thinking the probably what I do is just kind of play with that

327
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,700
camera code a little bit and just maybe sort of like get that stuff to

328
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,100
a state that I'm happy with and then that way next week we can start

329
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,900
on 3D Fresh.

330
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,600
So from the start of the episode, we'll just do that and you can kind

331
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,100
of see that we've got some weirdness is now and stuff that we would

332
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,200
probably want to improve and address.

333
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
So there's a couple different things we might want.

334
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,400
I want to do here, right?

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,800
So let's just talk about those for a second and then, we'll sort of

336
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
talk about what we can do with them, or

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Them.

338
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,000
So, at the end of yesterday's stream, we had gotten it to the point

339
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
where we now have all of these sort of rooms that can be different

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
sizes, right?

341
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,300
So we used to have it so that the rooms were always the same size and

342
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,400
now we have it so that the rooms are different sizes, right?

343
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,100
And you can sort of see that that's happening.

344
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,700
Both horizontally and vertically like we have rooms that are wider

345
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,000
rooms.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,800
That are narrower rooms that are taller rooms that are shorter because

347
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
It's just getting a random variable there and making the room whatever

348
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
that random size is and the rooms are just stacked against each other

349
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
with a dual row of trees in between them.

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,300
That's, that's all we made, you know, we don't have really any World

351
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,000
Generation code right now, we just have really basic stuff.

352
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,600
So if you take a look at what's going on there, you can see that that

353
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,200
basically everything is working fine with the camera in terms of

354
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
picking out, which rumor in and everything's working fine with the

355
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,800
world Gen 2.

356
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,300
A certain extent there and that's all fine.

357
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,200
But

358
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,100
Also, I would point out, you can kind of see where all our time is

359
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:09,600
going here.

360
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,200
Remember our get closest reversible function is of course the function

361
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
where we don't have any acceleration.

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,700
It's N squared.

363
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,500
So the number of entities on the screen, it just goes up and up and

364
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,000
up, right?

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,800
And is it's currently the very biggest of piggy.

366
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,300
So we kind of have a nice.

367
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,700
We have a nice profile there for our future optimization because

368
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,500
that's a function.

369
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,300
We can very easily.

370
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Down to very little cost anyway, but that's fine.

371
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,300
So if you take a look at what's going on here, everything's working

372
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,600
fine.

373
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,200
In terms of what we wrote, but obviously, it's not very good.

374
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
In terms of anything you would really want to ship in terms of a good

375
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,800
player experience.

376
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,300
The reason for that is like, you take a look in here and you know,

377
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:57,100
this this room is too big, you know, like for the player to even see

378
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,900
what's going on in the room and we don't make any attempt to like,

379
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,500
zoom out to see the whole room.

380
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,800
We also don't pay on the

381
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,400
The camera.

382
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,800
So if the room is too large you know then we get in these weird

383
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,100
situations where like the, you know, the camera just does really

384
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,900
strange things.

385
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, I guess they're not strange per se but they're not helpful.

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,700
Like if you were a player playing this game, like, you wouldn't be

387
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,700
happy with what was happening here in terms of how the camera was

388
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,200
moving around and we've never really done any real camera code here.

389
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,300
And so, what I think we probably want to do today is just going in and

390
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,600
finish up working on the camera code.

391
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,800
Like, okay, you can see all that is kind of nuts.

392
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,900
What's happening there, right?

393
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
We're gonna go in here and just make something that's a little more

394
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,200
sane for how we're doing our camera control.

395
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,800
And that way, when we have something more saying for doing our camera

396
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,200
control, we can just go ahead and

397
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,900
Jimmy, we can just go ahead and have our

398
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,400
Our gameplay systems, dictate what the camera is supposed to do and

399
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,800
then it will be relatively straightforward for those systems to pick

400
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,700
what they want.

401
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,000
And so for example, you know, you could imagine a circumstance where

402
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,800
we want to sort of, Zoom, the camera in and out to control how

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
particular like region work.

404
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,600
So for example, let's say that we turned on the debug camera here,

405
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,100
right?

406
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,100
Let's see.

407
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,600
There we go.

408
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,400
So, one thing that we might want to do, let's say we had a really tiny

409
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,200
room, right?

410
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,800
Let's say the room was only this big.

411
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Then we might want to like, zoom in to that room and sort of have it

412
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,700
so that we were all, you know, close in, you know, maybe that's a

413
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,100
little too close, but all closed in on the room because it's supposed

414
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,600
to feel like we're just focusing on that room, right?

415
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,900
But then, if a room is too large, you know, maybe a rooms really big

416
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,500
like this.

417
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,900
We may not feel like gameplay-wise.

418
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,500
The right thing to do is to zoom out all the way to the full scope of

419
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,300
the room because maybe it just gets too tiny and too difficult to

420
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,500
play, you know, I don't know, we don't know those answers ahead of

421
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,000
time.

422
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
So the important thing to do here, I think is just to make it so that

423
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,200
the camera system can do whatever we want it to do and then we can

424
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
have it so that as we're doing gameplay, we can sort of make decisions

425
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
on a case-by-case basis.

426
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,900
So maybe we want like, you know, you go in to talk to the shopkeeper

427
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,700
or something like this.

428
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,900
I'm not saying that there's a shopkeeper.

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Anything but you know, you can imagine in a game where they're, you

430
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,600
know, you're going to go buy something at the store if you imagine

431
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,600
something like that happening and maybe that room is for a tiny, maybe

432
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
we want to zoom in on that and that's the grammar for that.

433
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,700
So you zoom in zoom out on rooms of a certain size but maybe once

434
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,300
rooms get to a size that's larger you know that's that's too large.

435
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,600
That exceeds some threshold that we set maybe then the camera just

436
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,400
pans around to follow the player in the room as necessary, right?

437
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,100
It's really hard to say which of those were going to want.

438
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,300
So like I said, I think we just want to kind of focus on making a

439
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,400
camera system that will allow us to do whichever of those we want to

440
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:13,800
do.

441
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,600
Okay.

442
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,600
So yeah.

443
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,800
So basically we have a lot of easy options here in terms of actually

444
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
setting the camera, right?

445
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,900
And so for example just to illustrate how the system is currently

446
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,400
working especially for

447
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,300
You know, we bounced around a lot here and especially for beginners.

448
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,300
It's probably hard to keep all the what's going on in, you know, in

449
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,700
all the different pieces of code and how they work in your head

450
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,000
because you know, we bounce around and we change them and we talk

451
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,600
about different ones at different times which is, you know again very

452
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,400
in keeping with how game to go and actually works you know typically

453
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,300
you have to bring up systems kind of together and, you know, you're

454
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,700
not just focusing on doing one thing, finishing it completely and then

455
00:23:59,700 --> 00:23:59,800
move.

456
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,400
To the next sometimes that's the right answer but other times when you

457
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,300
try to do architecture, the answer is to kind of be more broad but you

458
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,800
know that can be very daunting for people who haven't done a lot of

459
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,100
these systems because they're trying to learn how to do the sum of the

460
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,600
program, the system and then there's also all this other stuff going

461
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,400
on and we're moving around.

462
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,000
In that can be pretty challenging when you're, you know, sort of first

463
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,500
starting out.

464
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,000
And so just to kind of reinforce what's going on here?

465
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,400
When we go into when we start playing the game, right?

466
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,900
And we've got

467
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
The camera.

468
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,300
The camera can actually be set at any distance above the Playfield

469
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,100
already, right?

470
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,500
Our debug camera isn't the only way that can happen.

471
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,400
There is a camera offset variable and you can see that.

472
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,400
Here.

473
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,400
So here's the game camera, right?

474
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
That we keep, it's basically just a struct that has some information.

475
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,400
It says, which entity its following.

476
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,100
It says what it's two positions were the one from the last frame, the

477
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,200
one from this Frame and it's got an offset.

478
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
And the offset is basically how far away from the central, like tiled

479
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
chunk position, which is this world position here.

480
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,900
Right?

481
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,500
The camera is and that's a three dimensional variables.

482
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,900
So not only can It displaced laterally and vertically in the room or

483
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,100
in the world, basically.

484
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,800
But it can also displace up and down.

485
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,700
And so if we want the camera to be back further, if you wanted to be

486
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,600
up higher, all we would have to do is just set that variable to be up.

487
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,500
Right?

488
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,100
You know set that Z value to be a greater value and we would zoom out

489
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
or at least that's how it's supposed to work, right?

490
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,000
So what we could say in let's just like again, to sort of illustrate

491
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,700
the example.

492
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Let's just say that, you know, we have these sort of room entity sorts

493
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,900
of things here if we wanted to

494
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,800
We can introduce a variable that was like, hey.

495
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,400
Let's say there's a thing called camera, height.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Right, let's just say that's what there is and what we're going to do

497
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,500
is whenever we go into update and render world's, we're going to call,

498
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,000
remember how this works.

499
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,200
We call stimulate, and then before we're done and we call update in

500
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,800
Winter Park systems before we're done.

501
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,300
We call a function called update camera for any movement, which sort

502
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,000
of decides where it's going to move the camera to, to follow the

503
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,200
entity that the cameras ostensibly supposed to follow.

504
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,000
Right.

505
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,900
So given that, that's what we want to do.

506
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
What I can do is say inside the the code for that function.

507
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,400
Which is update camera for entity movement.

508
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,700
What I would say is in this in this function I think we can just read

509
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,200
out because we know which entity is the entity defining the room that

510
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,400
we're in.

511
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,900
We can just read out of there, what the camera height should be and

512
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,100
then set the camera height to that.

513
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,000
And so I just want to show how that will pop the Heights in and out as

514
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,900
we move from room to room.

515
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I am, right?

516
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,100
And again this isn't going to be a good thing yet.

517
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,500
It's not going to look nice.

518
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,800
But I'm just trying to illustrate how we would go about constructing

519
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,900
that that beginning of the process.

520
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,800
So just knowing what the height should be right?

521
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,100
So here's well, I guess we have in room which is getting set.

522
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,500
So all I really need to do in here is say okay, here's the camera

523
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,100
offset, right?

524
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,800
You can see there that the camera offset is getting set and you can

525
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,600
see here it's getting set to a bunch of random stuff based on what the

526
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,800
entity.

527
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Situation is.

528
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,900
So then what I can say is oh in addition to that, right?

529
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,300
I can set the camera height.

530
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,900
I can I can offset whatever we were going to use for our camera height

531
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
by a greater height.

532
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,600
Based on.

533
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,200
Whatever the room were in says the camera height should be right.

534
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,700
And so most rooms, well, maybe just have that set at zero perhaps.

535
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,800
And then, you know, we've got kind of that exact situation, right?

536
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,700
Here's the camera height for this room, whatever.

537
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,400
Okay.

538
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,800
But what we can do now is say, well, okay, now when we're actually

539
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
creating these rooms.

540
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,300
So when we say add standard room, right?

541
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,300
You can see here, you can go in and say, well,

542
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,600
when we want to create one of these things and we, you know, you

543
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,400
remember, we added sort of a brain ID for these rooms where as my ads

544
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,300
standard room,

545
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,300
You can see when we added the room, entity itself, right?

546
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,200
Which is right here.

547
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,600
We have the opportunity to set something for it.

548
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,300
If we wanted to write here when it's created and that will get

549
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,200
remembered so later we can look at it.

550
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,600
So what we could do is say, well let's just see what the maximum width

551
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,000
and height settings are for this room and maybe set the height based

552
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,500
on that, right?

553
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,300
So here's our radius X and radius, why

554
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,300
What I could do is say, well let's make the camera height, be

555
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,800
proportional to their difference from the default or something like

556
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,300
that, right?

557
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,400
So what I can do is say all right let's suppose that we had a like

558
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,100
diff value here or something like that and that was going to be like a

559
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,000
clamped value.

560
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,300
Let's say where I'm going to say all right it's got to be the can't be

561
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,000
greater than it.

562
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Can't be less than zero but it's got to be something greater than 0

563
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,200
where I take.

564
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,500
Take the these two values here radius X and radius y, right?

565
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,100
I'll say radius x - its default which is 84 now.

566
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,500
And then I'll say take the maximum of

567
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,500
Both of these.

568
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,000
Right, where you say.

569
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,100
Okay, I take the maximum of the two radii eyes differences from the

570
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,800
default.

571
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
I don't want a lower value ever.

572
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,500
So like if there, if it's a smaller room, I'm not going to zoom closer

573
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,100
in at the moment.

574
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,800
I'm only going to talk about

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,700
Hang out and to take that difference and I'm going to make that

576
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
difference, be the camera height at the moment.

577
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,700
So for every tile outward we go, I'm going to move one unit upward.

578
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,700
For the camera, right?

579
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
At least that's the theory.

580
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,500
And so now you can see it's already sort of working to a certain

581
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,200
extent.

582
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,500
Now that we're in this room, you can see that we get a

583
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
zoom out that features the entire room.

584
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Here we go.

585
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,800
We got the, I think we're doing something wrong with our Collision

586
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,300
detection there, because there shouldn't be a middle area between the

587
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,200
rooms, but we're going to get to that in a second.

588
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,500
And so now, you know, we're zoomed out a little bit more so we can see

589
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,800
the whole room at once.

590
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,700
And there, you can see that that it was a discreet jump in the zoom

591
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,000
level.

592
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,100
Right.

593
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,000
Did you see that?

594
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,000
Because again, we're not interpolating that that value yet, we're just

595
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,700
jumping it.

596
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,900
So whenever we move from room to room we definitely have that that

597
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
jump, right?

598
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,800
But now you can sort of see that we fit the rooms much.

599
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,300
Nicely.

600
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,400
So, you know, we get into situations where we have a longer room or a

601
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,100
narrower room and we adjust.

602
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay.

603
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,300
And that's kind of nice.

604
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:16,200
Because now for game design purposes, if we want to write, we can

605
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,100
basically make the Playfield be whatever, we want it to be.

606
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,800
Now, what you'll notice here, this is the first time that's happened

607
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,100
so far.

608
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,100
When we've walked through it, you can kind of see that when we went

609
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,800
into this room here, the camera that that value is a very rough value

610
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,400
like that, that was just that ad hoc value that I picked.

611
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,300
And so if we actually wanted to see the whole room, right?

612
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,400
It would have looked like this, but that's actually what we got,

613
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,600
right?

614
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,400
So, it's not really looking at the whole room, the way that we would

615
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,900
want it to look at the whole room and so,

616
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,600
oh, and I just remembered why we're not doing good injection properly.

617
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,700
It's because we don't set room, we don't create corrosion boundaries

618
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,500
for the room yet.

619
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,600
So we already know why that is happening.

620
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,400
I already knew that yesterday, but forgot it anyway.

621
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,800
So, what's the reason for that, right?

622
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,300
Well, the reason for that and we'll sort of talk about this on the, on

623
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,800
the Whiteboard, I think is probably the most important the most

624
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
appropriate way.

625
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
I feel like we have to

626
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:36,900
Yeah.

627
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,300
One of these days, I'm going to get a graphics card, that's less than

628
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,100
10 years old.

629
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,800
So I can actually run Milton on it.

630
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Reliably, I'm still using.

631
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,400
I'm using an old version of built-in because I don't have a graphics

632
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,700
card that really it's it's a it's a six-year-old graphics card in this

633
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,200
machine.

634
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,000
It's old anyway.

635
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
So room.

636
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,400
Camera.

637
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,100
Fitting.

638
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So let's just talk about this problem briefly and I don't know that we

639
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,800
want to bother solving it really at this point but at least so you can

640
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
be aware of what the problem actually is.

641
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,100
And so, you know, we probably would solve it at some point, I don't

642
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,200
know, I guess it depends on whether we decide that we're going to use

643
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,300
this in this way or not.

644
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,400
So, what ends up happening, with camera fitting, right?

645
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,900
Is you can imagine, we've got you, if you've been following handmade

646
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,200
hero, you know, exactly how this sort of stuff works.

647
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
We've got a camera and the camera is

648
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
Down on the world, right?

649
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,900
This is our camera.

650
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,000
And this is z, right?

651
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,900
And we've got this sort of

652
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
plane here that we're looking down on, right?

653
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,300
And this is the world.

654
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,000
So, you know, the world is, is down here and the world is in these,

655
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
these Z slices, right?

656
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,700
Because it's a 2-D game, but in some sense we think of it as 3D.

657
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,000
So we actually, we actually do consider things having volume and

658
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,300
whatever.

659
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:08,000
But, you know, when we view it, we're sort of viewing a slice, slice

660
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
of stacked on top of each other.

661
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,800
So what ends up happening is these slices have always been the same

662
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,400
size.

663
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,100
And so from the cameras perspective, if we were to look at it, right?

664
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,300
If this is a room, what we've been typically doing is we've just been

665
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:29,600
hard coding, whatever the cameras, distance up was, right.

666
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,699
Here's the that viewing area.

667
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,400
Right.

668
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,600
So this rectangle here maps to this rectangle here, right?

669
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,300
This is top down we just been moving the camera back manually to see

670
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,800
however much of the room, we wanted to see.

671
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,199
So if we wanted to sort of make you know I just kind of tuned it to a

672
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,300
value that I thought looked appropriate and that's what we left it as

673
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,300
and that's a perfectly valid thing to do and that's how you want to do

674
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,600
that.

675
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,600
But we introduced a problem when we then say,

676
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,700
We don't know how big the room is, right?

677
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,800
Because if the room is only this big then we would pick a very

678
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,200
different value from how for how far the camera zooms out.

679
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,900
You know, because as the camera moves closer, this this viewing area

680
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,800
gets smaller.

681
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,800
And as the camera moves upward that viewing area gets larger, right?

682
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,800
So if the room is bigger, we want to move the camera further back and

683
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,900
if the room is smaller, we want to move the camera down.

684
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,700
But the key fact here is we don't know how much.

685
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:30,600
Right.

686
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,700
We have no notion of how much to move the camera.

687
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,400
So in the current system I just picked an ad hoc value.

688
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,500
Of 1 meter, right?

689
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Per tile in radius.

690
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,600
Right?

691
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
That's what I did.

692
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,600
So I basically said all right, here's the standard room size.

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Okay, you know, it's it's radius is at the moment its radii at the

694
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,700
moment.

695
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,200
Is eight tiles this way and five tiles.

696
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Sorry for tiles this way.

697
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,300
So all I did was say, okay for every room, if you go over eight tiles,

698
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:12,800
right?

699
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,300
So if you get more than eight tiles out for every tile, you go out add

700
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,900
a meter to the height of the camera.

701
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,800
So if you were going to be out here, you would add one me to the

702
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,600
height of the camera.

703
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,800
Similarly for everyone you go out here, add one more to the hi to the

704
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,100
camera.

705
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,800
Now, since these two things don't

706
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Add together.

707
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,200
Meaning, if I'm already moving out this far, I don't need to also,

708
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,900
move out again to capture this because movement of the camera upwards

709
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,500
expands the horizontal and the vertical range.

710
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,000
So, what that means is that I just take the maximum, I just said,

711
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,800
whichever one of these two, right is going to be greater use that

712
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,500
difference.

713
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,600
And by the way, if you go inside here don't bother because you know we

714
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,200
didn't we don't get closer in on ones that are lower at the moment we

715
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
have a quart of a minimum Zoom range.

716
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,900
Right?

717
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,000
So the problem here is that's a totally ad-hoc thing, right?

718
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,700
And you know, don't get me wrong, you can absolutely.

719
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Ship a game with ad hoc stuff like that.

720
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
It happens all the time.

721
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,900
Hand-tuned constants, when they work, they work and you're done,

722
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,500
right?

723
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,000
So you don't need to belabor Technical Solutions to problems.

724
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,700
You don't actually have and so if this is good enough for you, then

725
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,400
you should just use it but we may get into situations where it's not

726
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,300
good enough, right?

727
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,600
And so it begs the question, what could we do?

728
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,400
That would be better.

729
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,800
Well, as you know it's just math, right?

730
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,800
It's not like we couldn't figure out how big the cameras viewing area

731
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:55,800
is when you get down to this particular distance from the camera,

732
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,400
right?

733
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,300
Because if we were to look at this again from the side, let's say so

734
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,800
this is perfectly sidon.

735
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,000
Here's the the viewing axis of the camera.

736
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,200
Right.

737
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Viewing side on.

738
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,800
And here are like sheets.

739
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,100
And you can imagine, like, as we go down further in the camera, like,

740
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,200
maybe this is like three meters away and maybe this is five meters

741
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,000
away and maybe this is 7 and you know, looks like a little more.

742
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,900
So I mean that's 10.

743
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,300
I don't know.

744
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,300
So whatever distance away we are here.

745
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,200
Each time we go down.

746
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,100
We're widening that area, right?

747
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,200
Now, at any given for any given room, we know both things.

748
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,500
We would need to know to reverse our calculations, right?

749
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,300
We know how big the room is okay, because we know how big a tile is

750
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,800
and we know that if we make a thing that's

751
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
12 tiles by eight tiles.

752
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Let's say we know how big that actually is in meters, right?

753
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,800
So we know if we were looking at one of these things, we know like oh

754
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,400
okay, if this is how far away it is from the camera and and we know

755
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,700
how big the room is maybe it occupies this much space, right?

756
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,500
We could easily compute both of, you know, we know this value, we

757
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,900
could easily compute this value and say well we know the camera is

758
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,500
viewing this much distance

759
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,200
We know we want to view this much distance.

760
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,400
So there's a gap here and it's like, is that Gap?

761
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,900
You know, we probably would have some value for The Gap.

762
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,400
How much of a gap do we want?

763
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
Or are willing to have any?

764
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,900
That Gap is too big or too small you know maybe the room just over

765
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,800
blows the size entirely so we know it's totally just marketers.

766
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,000
No Gap at all we can solve for the distance.

767
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
We would have to move the camera like how far out it has to be in

768
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,700
order to be that size, right?

769
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,900
And doing this is not that hard because it's

770
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,900
All just very simple, high school geometry.

771
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,400
Right.

772
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,100
It's just a case, it will trigonometry.

773
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,500
Sorry, I think is the correct categorization here.

774
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,600
It's just a case of similar triangles, right?

775
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,200
We have a situation.

776
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,300
Where we've got the camera here.

777
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,200
It's looking down here.

778
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,400
We know we've got, you know, and you could imagine, there's just the

779
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,200
other side of the, the of it here.

780
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
But we're only gonna look at the right triangle part of it, because we

781
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
know that it's just 2.

782
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,400
X is the distance here.

783
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,000
so, we know that if we have a

784
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,400
A ratio that can produce, you know, we know we know how to compute

785
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,900
these triangles, which we do know how to do.

786
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,700
If you go back to how we're going to production, will go over it

787
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,100
again.

788
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,800
If we know how to compute, one of these triangles for some distance

789
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,300
here.

790
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,900
Right.

791
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,600
So we know for the distance away from the camera.

792
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,800
We know how long this leg of the triangle is right?

793
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,400
We know this is basically the viewing with right?

794
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,700
It's a half the viewing with right.

795
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,100
Let's say so if we know how to compute half of Ewing with from the

796
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,800
distance

797
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,300
Then we know how to compute the complete viewing with the distance.

798
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,300
So if you give us some other viewing with right, we know that it's

799
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,400
just going to be a straight ratio of that one that we want, right?

800
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,200
Which would be you know, half the distance half the viewing with we

801
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,600
wanted which would be here.

802
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,600
This is like our desired with right over to so half the desired width

803
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,200
versus this thing.

804
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,500
We don't know which is the like desired distance, right desired

805
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,900
distance.

806
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,700
I guess these are some pad pie, huh?

807
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,200
Have too many D's here.

808
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,900
Let me try that one more time.

809
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,100
Let's try that one more time.

810
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,800
So we've got the width of the view and the width of the desired versus

811
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,700
the desired View.

812
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
And the desired.

813
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,700
Distance.

814
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,400
Right.

815
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,200
So we know this and this right?

816
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,200
Our ratio that we already know because we set up the camera so we know

817
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,700
how to generate these triangles.

818
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:12,900
Right.

819
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,200
We already know what these are.

820
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,800
So since we're prescribing, one of these, all we have to do is solve

821
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,000
for one of these, right?

822
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,900
Because these things set up an obvious ratio since they are similar

823
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,400
triangles.

824
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,800
We can easily just say that DV / w v equals d d.

825
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,200
Over WD.

826
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,500
It's just a similar triangle ratio of the sides have to be in ratio to

827
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,100
each other.

828
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,500
So solving for one of these is a simple as multiplying out, right?

829
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,600
So you just have DV / WV X through WD equals your DD, right?

830
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,100
It's just like I said, really simple high school math.

831
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,900
Nothing to it.

832
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,900
So as long as we know that ratio as long as we know, how to compute

833
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,300
that ratios for similar triangles, for our camera, which we had to do

834
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,800
to make the projection equations in the

835
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,500
First place.

836
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:06,200
Then we know how to produce that and again, we have to do this though,

837
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,600
keep in mind that it's, it has to be done for both of our axes if we

838
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,900
were to look at this top down again, right?

839
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
So here's the camera, it's looking down on things.

840
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,300
We have to know this for both of our axes.

841
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,000
So we have to know it for our viewing with and for our viewing height.

842
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,600
So we're actually going to have two of these equations where we end up

843
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,100
with two different distances.

844
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,500
One is the distance where we would exactly fit, you know, that the

845
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,900
camera would have to be up to exactly fit the width that we asked for.

846
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,300
And one would be to exactly fit the height that we asked for, right?

847
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Because again, the screen is not a square.

848
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,600
The screen is a

849
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,300
Tangle.

850
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,500
So the computation will be different for each.

851
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,700
So we feed it a rectangle and say, okay, tell me for this with of a

852
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,000
room that I want, what is the width of what is the distance for the

853
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,300
camera to match it for this height of the room?

854
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,400
What is the height off the ground of the camera to match it right in

855
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:03,800
both cases?

856
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,500
We got to have ground.

857
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,800
We're going to end up with two camera distances, right to Heights of

858
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,000
the camera off the ground.

859
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,000
And it's kind of hard to I'm using height in two different ways here.

860
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,200
So, I guess I should just say for a, you know, for an X range and a y

861
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,500
range, what is the Z displacement?

862
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,800
The camera off of that plane, that will give me what I want, right?

863
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm going to end up with two different displacement values, right?

864
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,700
So I'm going to have two different cameras.

865
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,000
He's so all I need to do is say well, okay, what I'm trying to do is

866
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,100
fit the whole room.

867
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,300
So I just want to take whichever one is greater because whichever one

868
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,800
is greater will Encompass, the more difficult thing to Encompass,

869
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:41,900
right?

870
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,700
You can imagine a room that was like very oblong, right?

871
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,300
So this width is very small, and this height is very big, right?

872
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,900
Well, the distance for the camera to Encompass, this room is going to

873
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,400
be something like that, right?

874
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,400
So obviously the

875
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,600
Value that the get back from solving, this is going to say well to fit

876
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,800
the width, you don't have to be very high.

877
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,900
But to fit the height, you have to be very high.

878
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,900
Obviously, we want to fit the height.

879
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,400
In the case, where we want to fit the whole room now.

880
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,100
So that's Max, right?

881
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,900
That's we would take the maximum of the two, but we might also want to

882
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,600
take again for gameplay, purposes may be wanting the minimum of the

883
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
two because the other way we could look at this problem is by saying

884
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,400
if there's a room that's really hablo like that, what I want to do is

885
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,600
see a whole, I want to fill the screen with the room, right?

886
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,400
So what I want to do is take whichever Dimension.

887
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,900
Fits the tightest.

888
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,000
And take that, and that would be men.

889
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,300
And then that's if we wanted to do screen scrolling because then we

890
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,700
would know we'd fit one axis.

891
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,500
Exactly.

892
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,000
And we'd scroll the other axis, right?

893
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,600
So hopefully that makes some sense.

894
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,000
Okay.

895
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,700
So how would we actually do that if we want to do that?

896
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,800
And I guess we don't need the game running at the moment.

897
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,700
What would we actually do there?

898
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,200
Well, if you remember, go back to render group, you go down to the

899
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:07,700
bottom.

900
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,300
And if you remember, there's a bunch of stuff that we were doing here

901
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,700
that already sort of involved, all these things.

902
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,300
Right?

903
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,900
So you can see a bunch of this stuff down at the bottom of the

904
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:17,600
function here.

905
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,500
And we have, like, for example, this thing called on Project where you

906
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,200
give it an object transform and pixels x Y, which is basically like

907
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:25,800
the the

908
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,600
The pixel position of the thing that you want on Project, right?

909
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,300
And it undoes the projection pushes it Forward, right?

910
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,600
And so, what you can see here is if we have an orthographic transform.

911
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,300
Well, we don't care about that kind of thing because we're doing a

912
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,600
perspective transform for our geometry.

913
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,900
So, the orthographic transform is really not relevant.

914
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,400
That's for like you I and stuff.

915
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,100
But if you take a look at this other one here, you can see, okay?

916
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,800
So we kind of know how to unprotect stuff off the screen.

917
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,600
If we take a screen location and we subtract whatever the center of

918
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,900
the screen is right?

919
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,200
Then we multiply it by our m, 2 pixels to get it into World space.

920
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,000
So we're it's coming in and pixels and we want

921
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:06,800
Buy it.

922
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,300
Bye-bye.

923
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,300
We have M to pixels and we want pixels to M.

924
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,200
So we're inverting it.

925
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:15,700
Right?

926
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,300
Then we go ahead and take the distance above the target - however far

927
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:20,600
away.

928
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,200
The thing is, and we divide that by our focal length, we then multiply

929
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
by, we take that

930
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,100
ratio.

931
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,200
Which again, is that similar triangle ratio is just talking about and

932
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,300
we multiplied by a to get, which is the the pick M value.

933
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,600
We look at their to get where we would be in World space, right?

934
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,700
That pretty much tells us exactly the equations we were looking for

935
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:45,900
before, right?

936
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,900
So we, this right here, is that ratio right the transform distance

937
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,100
above Target - Ossipee?

938
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,600
That's the distance, right?

939
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,300
And then this focal length here that we divide by

940
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
that's the thing that actually,

941
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,600
To the ratio that tells us about the similar triangles, right?

942
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,000
So once we have a value that's in meters, it's pretty trivial for us

943
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,600
to get it back, right?

944
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,500
So,

945
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,000
if we want it to,

946
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,300
We could go ahead and say here, all right.

947
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,800
Let's create something.

948
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:35,700
That will tell us this information that we want to know if I am going

949
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,300
to pass in some kind of a rectangle, right?

950
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,300
So I this is exactly the function, I just talking about if I say I

951
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:49,600
want to, you know, get distances get you know, camera distance for

952
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,300
rectangle,

953
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,400
Or maybe like fit camera distance to rectangle or something like that.

954
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,100
so if we want to, we can pass in the dimensions of our rectangle and

955
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,700
then this information here,

956
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,100
So assuming that the object that we're talking about is that this

957
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,600
transform and it has this Dimension right?

958
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,800
What is the distance that the camera would have to be off of the plane

959
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,900
in order to give us what we want?

960
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,200
and so given that we pretty much know like I sang for

961
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,700
we know that the distance above the target, which is

962
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,500
okay, we know that this camera transform, right?

963
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,800
Which is set for our render group.

964
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,100
This camera transform is going to, give us the distance above the

965
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,800
Target that we're looking for and the object, transform offset, P .z.

966
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,100
That's going to give us.

967
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,500
That's going to give us the focal length.

968
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,000
That's that plus the focal length.

969
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,200
The transform is going to give us that ratio.

970
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,900
Now, you'll note, we don't really need the offset Z here, right?

971
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,500
It's really just, we could just use essentially the focal, length

972
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
input, the focal length and a z-value to

973
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,900
they're right, those, those could be

974
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,200
Those could be the pieces of information that we actually pass into

975
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:28,800
the routine.

976
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,500
But I'll keep it like this for now, just for a second and we'll get

977
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,700
see what we want to do in a minute, right?

978
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,500
So

979
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,400
if we compute that ratio right, what we've got here is this is

980
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,300
expanded out a little bit here, right?

981
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,900
This is our Z value.

982
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,400
In fact, I can actually even just name them what they were here if you

983
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,800
take a look at

984
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:57,800
No.

985
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,600
If we take a look at this here, right?

986
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,800
We've got our DV and rwv, right?

987
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,600
So those are

988
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,300
The focal length.

989
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,500
So it's kind of tough to describe focal length as well because it's

990
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
sort of a

991
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,300
It's sort of an odd concept, right, but the focal length of the lens.

992
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,900
We talked about before is if you imagine

993
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,000
This were an actual camera.

994
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,900
The the image plane of the camera is sort of back behind the camera

995
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,200
lens, right?

996
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,300
Here's the lens and the focal length is where that image.

997
00:51:53,700 --> 00:52:01,700
The focal length of the lens is where it Focus how far back from the

998
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,200
lens.

999
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,000
It takes to sort of converge the the light, right?

1000
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,600
I can get a better diagram for this.

1001
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,200
I'm sure, here you go.

1002
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,400
So when the lens, you know, when you have if you imagine a curve lens

1003
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,200
here, right?

1004
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,000
The focal length of the lens is from that lens shape.

1005
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,300
It's how far it takes to converge the light to a point, right?

1006
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,600
So I probably this is kind of a misleading way to draw this.

1007
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,300
I mean, really, it's like,

1008
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,700
That sort of thing, right?

1009
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,200
Because the lens is an actual is not a point, right?

1010
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,800
The lens is an actual shape.

1011
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:57,400
So anyway, the focal length is, is that distance there, right?

1012
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And it's basically saying from the imaginary lens back to the point

1013
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
where the light converges and then from that point, right?

1014
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
The light and it's not like when I said I wanted a better diagram, I

1015
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,900
guess this isn't really the diagram I wanted.

1016
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,100
Because I wanted to show the light converging.

1017
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:19,700
And then diverging again basically like the focal length is here and

1018
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,700
then this sort of reversal of the light.

1019
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,600
As it passes through, that one point, then has a an image plane or

1020
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,900
something like the film of the camera or whatever.

1021
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,200
The CCD of a digital camera, where the light is getting sort of

1022
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,400
placed, right with the lights getting collected and we don't simulate

1023
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,000
any of that in our pipeline.

1024
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,900
Or anything like that.

1025
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,200
Some Advanced 3D pipelines will try to simulate things for this,

1026
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,200
right?

1027
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,700
But for our purposes, right?

1028
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,400
It's just this value here, right?

1029
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:58,000
And so in order for us to know what we are, expecting this value to be

1030
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,800
right here is the focal length.

1031
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,200
So that's the focal length.

1032
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,200
But this value right here, we don't actually know what that is, right?

1033
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,500
We that's not in this equation here, right?

1034
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,400
And you can kind of see that it's that it's not being, you know, it's

1035
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,700
not represented here, right?

1036
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,900
So what is that actual you know what is that actual value?

1037
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,400
Well, we do have that value.

1038
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,800
It's just not in its not stored in there for the camera, transform.

1039
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,500
Where we have M to pixels screen center, focal length.

1040
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,300
This is about Target and all that stuff, right?

1041
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,300
What we actually needed was the monitor have Tim in meters, right?

1042
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,600
The monitor half-demon m is the thing that tells us how wide the

1043
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,600
screen actually is at that focal length, right?

1044
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:48,800
So for that distance away, we know that the monitor half-demon m is

1045
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,100
actually how big the monitor itself will be and that wasn't relevant

1046
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,500
in our unprojected because nobody in the unprotect cares, how big the

1047
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,100
monitor is, right?

1048
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,300
That's just not relevant.

1049
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,100
Because I mean, in some sense, they do, but it's baked into m 2

1050
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,700
pixels, right?

1051
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:09,900
M, 2 pixels, already captures that for the purposes of unprojected,

1052
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,800
which doesn't care.

1053
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,800
What the actual extents of the monitor are in any particular way,

1054
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,600
right?

1055
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,000
So now if we want to compute this ratio, we know we've got the focal

1056
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,700
length, which is that distance and we know that we've got the monitor

1057
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,100
half dim in meters.

1058
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,000
Which is the either, the width or the height of modern painting on

1059
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,400
which one we want, but it's half of it, right?

1060
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,200
So at that point, we can easily just go.

1061
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,000
Okay, we know we can, I don't know why I've got this as e here.

1062
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,100
We know, we can compute exactly this triangle relation by using this

1063
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,300
as the monitor half-demon.

1064
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,200
M, this as the focal length, right?

1065
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,000
And then we can solve for this using this input, which is the dim,

1066
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,700
right?

1067
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,300
Because it's only

1068
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:56,800
One leg.

1069
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,700
We don't know me.

1070
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:03,800
All right.

1071
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,900
So let's just continue down this road a little bit.

1072
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,300
So when in fact what we could do here is safe it camera distance

1073
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,500
instead of two rectangle.

1074
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,300
I think what I might do is make two of these right fit camera distance

1075
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,500
to

1076
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,600
Two Dimension, right?

1077
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,200
And what fit cameras in two Dimension would be.

1078
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:41,000
We say, all right, for the monitor half dim in meters and a dimension

1079
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,700
in meters.

1080
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,700
And then the focal length.

1081
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,000
For those three values.

1082
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,700
All, that's all I need to know to compute this ratio.

1083
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,800
So all I need to do is say, my result is going to be the focal length,

1084
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,700
right?

1085
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,100
Which again is, is this DV here, right?

1086
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,800
And we solve the equation, there's the DV X.

1087
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:16,100
Whatever that Dimension is, that I was looking for mentioning m.

1088
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:29,900
/, whatever /, whatever that that monitor have Tim was

1089
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,500
But this of course has to be halved as well because we're only looking

1090
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:41,500
at half so we might as well just say half dimension in meters so that

1091
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,600
way if that's what people happen to have they have it otherwise they

1092
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,500
can multiply it by 2.

1093
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,000
Right?

1094
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,700
I mean I divide it by 2 or X .5

1095
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,800
So that computes are similar triangle for one dimension, right?

1096
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,100
And it gets us back.

1097
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,400
You can see the conversion happening.

1098
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,000
Pretty directly.

1099
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,100
If you think about the dimensional analysis, right?

1100
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,800
You've essentially got a focal length, you're trying to solve for

1101
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,500
another focal length.

1102
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,900
So you multiply the focal length by the dimension that you're actually

1103
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,900
looking for and you divide it by the dimension that, you know, is the

1104
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,700
screen dimension.

1105
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,500
And that's the ratio right there that you're looking at, right?

1106
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,700
You could you could view it, alternatively more.

1107
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:24,200
This, if it because it makes a little more sense, perhaps, right?

1108
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,300
Where you say, if I divide these two Dimensions by each other, because

1109
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,100
those are two things that I know that are in the same space, then I

1110
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,800
can multiply by the focal length to get out some other focal length.

1111
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,900
That's essentially going to be the distance that I want the camera to

1112
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,100
be at, right?

1113
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,100
So,

1114
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,500
Since this is all over the monitor half-demon M, that's good.

1115
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,100
Because that way we're never going to divide by zero because we know

1116
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,700
that the monitor cannot be zero.

1117
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,700
We should not be getting to this point if it is, right?

1118
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So we could guard this, but I'm not going to.

1119
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,000
That's if you like size the window, all the way down to zero.

1120
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,200
I think we just don't want that to be allowed.

1121
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,100
So, what we would do, if we allowed sizing of that nature, I think we

1122
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,200
would just not, we would just not call the game render loop.

1123
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,600
At all, if we detected the monitor size of zero,

1124
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
So anyway, fit camera distance to rectangle that is going to now want

1125
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
to do this twice.

1126
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:31,100
So what that's going to do is say like okay, we've got a, you know, a

1127
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:35,600
dimension or a result rather which is just two calls to this.

1128
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,200
And that's going to call it with all of these same pieces of

1129
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,100
information, right?

1130
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,900
And when we do fit cameras, direct angle, I guess what I'd say is,

1131
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,300
let's just go ahead and do it this way.

1132
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
Speaker names.

1133
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:19,900
Maybe something like that.

1134
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,200
I don't know.

1135
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:20,900
I'm not sure.

1136
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,300
Is this a still half dim?

1137
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,000
I guess they're both the same, really?

1138
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,200
Honestly, they're the same.

1139
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,300
so, if we go ahead and call this,

1140
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,200
Halftime in all cases and then we just have two versions of it.

1141
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,000
You know, one you can call with a veck to and one that you don't and

1142
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,200
then we just pass it through.

1143
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,300
So that is a way to just sort of say, okay?

1144
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,400
You know, we're going to do an X and A Y version together here if you

1145
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:02,700
want to.

1146
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,300
That's the same equation, doesn't matter.

1147
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,900
It's just giving.

1148
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,700
It's just doing it with a vector, right?

1149
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:08,900
So no big deal there.

1150
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,700
And so once we have that function, now we should be able to compute

1151
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,800
the values that we wanted to compute in order to get information about

1152
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,300
the camera transform.

1153
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:30,500
Now, one of the interesting things about the camera transform in this

1154
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,300
case again, is this kind of ad hoc so.

1155
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,700
You know, we're probably clean this up a little bit when we do the 3D

1156
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,700
version of it, but you can see that it's got a distance above Target,

1157
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,300
that's inside the camera transform.

1158
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,600
And so what we kind of want to do here is

1159
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,900
And that's going to get taken into account.

1160
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,700
So, whatever value this gives us back is actually has to be compared

1161
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,600
against the distance above Target because it's not like the value we

1162
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,500
set for the camera.

1163
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,400
Doesn't include that it does.

1164
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,900
So if we take a look for example, at World mode, right?

1165
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,400
And we go in here,

1166
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,900
And here you can see us trying to do with the camera stuff.

1167
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Here's the distance above ground, it's just set to 11, right?

1168
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,200
And so that distance above ground value is kind of baked into

1169
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,800
everything and to be honest I guess I don't really know why.

1170
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,100
It is set that way.

1171
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,500
Sorry Justin Smoak Target.

1172
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,800
Because really, that distance above Target value seems like the sort

1173
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,800
of thing that should just be set off the camera off set directly,

1174
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:46,200
right?

1175
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:52,500
I mean, if you think about it, there's not a whole lot of reason why

1176
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,300
you would not want that to just be all part of the camera offset,

1177
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:57,700
right?

1178
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,800
So the fact that that

1179
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,300
Since above Target, is there at all, is kind of weird and doesn't make

1180
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:07,200
a whole lot of sense to be honest.

1181
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,400
Because it just seems like

1182
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,900
You're just putting a lot of weird stuff.

1183
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,600
In there for no reason, right?

1184
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,600
I mean, here's the camera transform, right?

1185
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,700
And this distance above Target is really the camera position in Z

1186
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,500
essentially.

1187
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:35,600
But what you'll notice about that is, it doesn't include any other

1188
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,500
positional information for the camera, which is kind of bizarre,

1189
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,300
right?

1190
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,100
Like, if you were going to include an offset for the camera inside the

1191
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,000
camera transform, which of course, makes plenty of sense, you would

1192
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,100
expect it to be a veck 3 because you would expect it to be a thing

1193
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,000
with says, hey, you know, here's

1194
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
The displacement that you apply to everything before you transform it,

1195
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,500
right?

1196
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,200
But instead, we only have a z transform that we apply in there.

1197
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
And why we do that?

1198
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,100
I have no idea because you'll also notice that we ended up deciding to

1199
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,400
do here is in the object transform.

1200
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:18,400
Which is right here.

1201
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,500
We bake in the camera position to that transfer, right?

1202
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,900
So we're essentially doing that because we don't have any way to not

1203
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,600
do that because the camera transform itself isn't allowing us to

1204
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,300
specify an actual Veeck three, right?

1205
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:37,000
Which doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you get right down to it.

1206
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
And if you take a look at what's happening with that camera pz there,

1207
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,600
right?

1208
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,700
We're using that value out of the camera P, but really, it's more

1209
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,500
appropriate.

1210
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
That that should have been something that was in the camera,

1211
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,400
transformed to begin with, because that's what that actually means.

1212
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,000
We're now sort of having a pass to things all the time a camera

1213
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,900
transform.

1214
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,100
But then wait, no really.

1215
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,400
The also, the camera transform, right.

1216
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,700
And that's just kind of dumb.

1217
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,200
It doesn't really make very much sense, so,

1218
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,800
Maybe let's take the opportunity here.

1219
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,200
Oops.

1220
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,900
Maybe let's take the opportunity there to just correct that oversight

1221
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,300
such as it is.

1222
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,100
And so when we have this is above Target, I'm just going to say, let's

1223
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,300
say that this is the camera.

1224
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,500
P.

1225
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,500
And so we'll set the camera position in World space in our camera

1226
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,100
transform.

1227
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,900
And then that will just apply everywhere, right?

1228
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,300
And that seems better.

1229
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,500
So if we just do that, then what we should be able to do is say okay

1230
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,800
whenever we have like distance above Target here,

1231
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,500
Whenever we're using that somewhere else, what we want to do is just

1232
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,600
apply that transform completely, right?

1233
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,600
It's going to get applied on top of

1234
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,100
The all of the other piece of information that we have here, you can

1235
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,200
see that all the rest of this stuff right?

1236
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,400
Where we have rho, XY and all that stuff, and original p + object

1237
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,600
transform and all that, you know, stuff.

1238
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,400
So when we have our row XY, that's our p.

1239
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,300
X y, that's coming in here and being done with the object transform

1240
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,100
and all that stuff.

1241
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,700
What we should be able to do is say, oh, all right.

1242
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,200
Take the p.

1243
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,700
X y and add the camera transforms.

1244
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,700
X Y to it, right?

1245
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,400
Well not add subtract right because wherever you move the camera,

1246
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,600
everything going to center around it, so subtract that away, right?

1247
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,800
And then when we want distance above Target, okay, we can just look at

1248
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,500
that Z value that we have their right and then the rest of our stuff

1249
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,100
just flows.

1250
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,400
Normally there's there's nothing else that has to happen there, right?

1251
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,800
Similarly when we want this piece of information here, right?

1252
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,500
We have to do the same thing but we have to do it in reverse so we've

1253
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:08,300
got our camera P here and we're going to do that again that same

1254
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:13,700
subtraction so to find the distance from the difference from where the

1255
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,900
camera is in that case to finish the on Project to me.

1256
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:23,000
And then we also have to do the exact same thing when we then figure

1257
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,500
out what the result is of our own projection or rather, when we

1258
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,500
produce our world space piece of information.

1259
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:35,100
Remember what we were doing is we're doing this displacement and then

1260
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:35,900
we're projecting.

1261
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,200
So now we need to unprotect and then do the displacement.

1262
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,900
So we've done the on projection here, we then have to go ahead and

1263
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:46,000
say, okay, whatever, our unprojected XY is, we have to then add the

1264
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,200
camera transform back in.

1265
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,600
So in this case, right, we could change this result.

1266
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,900
Well, I guess because it's got the offset pay for the whole thing.

1267
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,500
When we go ahead and do that on Project, X Y, we can just add into it.

1268
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,400
The transform camera.

1269
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,000
Peas, xy2, like restore that part of the transform, right?

1270
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,400
So when we say, get camera rectangle, at Target, this is again just

1271
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,300
doing the same sort of unprotect here.

1272
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,100
And so when that place is distance, when that calls camera transform

1273
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,600
can't above Target, we just want to

1274
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:23,300
Say for the camera peas Z value, that's all that piece of information

1275
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,399
is actually giving us in this case.

1276
01:08:25,399 --> 01:08:28,700
Now when we call the perspective transform what we're going to want to

1277
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:32,100
do is say okay what we actually want to do is pass a whole camera P

1278
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:32,500
here.

1279
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,800
And similarly, although my head is in the way.

1280
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,899
Let's just kind of scroll down there little bit.

1281
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:51,399
When I say, distance from Target here, equals one point O we again,

1282
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,899
can just say, well, alright, we have a camera p, and that can be equal

1283
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:56,399
to.

1284
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,800
That effectively what the same thing was.

1285
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:05,700
So now whenever we call perspective and we want to say distance above

1286
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:09,000
Target, the question is now just, where is the actual camera P?

1287
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,000
Right?

1288
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:15,600
And so, if you look at where the camera p is getting computed, let's

1289
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,700
find out here in update and render worlds.

1290
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:23,899
Should be getting called down here somewhere.

1291
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,300
There it is.

1292
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Here is our world mode camera offset World transform offset P nonsense

1293
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,500
right?

1294
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,200
All of this stuff now hopefully we can sort of take away and make a

1295
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,100
little bit cleaner right?

1296
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:38,899
Second.

1297
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,399
Okay, so let's see if we can do that.

1298
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,500
So you can see in this case, when we call simulate, it's not relevant,

1299
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:50,600
right?

1300
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,899
Because simulate doesn't actually oh wait, no it is.

1301
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,500
So here's our world mode camera offset that's getting past their

1302
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,000
right?

1303
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,700
And so the goal here is to sort of get rid of that world mode camera

1304
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,300
offset, right?

1305
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,600
We want this to look like that.

1306
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,300
So the world mode camera offset is actually just part of that camera

1307
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:07,900
P.

1308
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,200
That's getting set up in the first place, right?

1309
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,500
So the world mode camera offset.

1310
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,100
I don't think it's actually touched anywhere in here.

1311
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,000
It doesn't look like it is.

1312
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,300
So I'm just going to go ahead and put it in here for now.

1313
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:24,800
There you go.

1314
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,400
And we'll see, we'll we'll give it a shot.

1315
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,200
So here in simulate

1316
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,800
just here, it's taking this camera all set.

1317
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,200
I'm just gonna get rid of that and I'm going to get rid of everywhere,

1318
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,000
we were passing it.

1319
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,800
So I'm just I'm just getting rid of that pull chain of custody there,

1320
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,100
right?

1321
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,400
Where people were passing that down.

1322
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,300
Which is good, right?

1323
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:57,500
We want to simplify that and then we just need one in cure for the

1324
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,800
this is for the

1325
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:05,100
The layered scene rendering and you can see in here, we actually have

1326
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:08,300
a camera offset value, which is what we were using here and that

1327
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,900
camera offset value is probably getting applied all the time, right?

1328
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,900
You can see it getting applied all in here, rather than rewrite that

1329
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:19,200
code.

1330
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:22,200
I'll just leave it the way it is at the moment, but you could imagine

1331
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,100
making this simpler as well to do.

1332
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:32,400
We could simplify this potentially in the future by changing the

1333
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,900
camera situation here.

1334
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,600
And so, then all we really have to do is take this entity stuff which

1335
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,300
was taking into account before, and if we want to we can literally

1336
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,800
just get it out of the render group because it's there.

1337
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,000
And that should actually be all, I think we really need to do.

1338
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,400
So let's double-check

1339
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,500
Epically successful.

1340
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,900
You always gotta love staring at a blank stream, blank screen.

1341
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:15,000
So yeah, you'll notice, this is why I decided to do this first before

1342
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,400
blanking, before, trying to do the other thing at the same time

1343
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,000
because I had a feeling we were going to have to trace the thrill more

1344
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,600
carefully.

1345
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:31,400
And I suspect that that I suspect that that blank screen, indicates

1346
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,000
that, that is correct assumption.

1347
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,200
So you can see that we're just using the camera peas.

1348
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,200
Z values here,

1349
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:37,900
That's all.

1350
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,800
That's really getting done.

1351
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,200
And oh right.

1352
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:45,200
And so this offset P now is already always going to take that into

1353
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:46,900
effect, right?

1354
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,900
So, the offset P of the entity transform.

1355
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:56,600
No longer has to have that information in it and that is at least one

1356
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,600
Improvement that was.

1357
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,100
Yeah, that was going to cause problems.

1358
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:03,800
But so the camera P getting used, let's see where this is going to be

1359
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,200
used here.

1360
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:04,800
So,

1361
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,300
That camera P getting used to figure out these typical floor height

1362
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,100
piece of information.

1363
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,300
Again, that's something that we want to get rid of entirely

1364
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,000
eventually.

1365
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,000
So, yeah, we're going to have to do something about that, it at some

1366
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,700
point.

1367
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,900
But, you know, for now, I think that should have still been working,

1368
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:23,600
right?

1369
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,900
We should still have been able to use the camera P there, that

1370
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,300
shouldn't have been causing us any problems.

1371
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,500
I don't think.

1372
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,300
Right?

1373
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,800
So I'm guessing and I don't actually know, but all we really need to

1374
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,500
do is just to restore to our offset system.

1375
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:45,000
The concept that we had a basis of 11 meters before so this distance

1376
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,400
above ground,

1377
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,100
Lb is bright.

1378
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:48,300
This is not in there anymore.

1379
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,300
And so, I think if we just now say that our base camera offset,

1380
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:57,500
because remember, we're setting the camera offset here in add standard

1381
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:57,900
room.

1382
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,800
I think all we have to do is say our standard camera offset.

1383
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,500
Now just has to be taken into account when we are creating that camera

1384
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,900
height piece of information.

1385
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,000
So instead of just the diff what we actually want is that base value

1386
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:15,800
of 11

1387
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:17,900
Plus the death.

1388
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:24,800
And I think that may be it Famous Last Words course, it's not, let me

1389
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,900
just check something here.

1390
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,900
So you can see that we do have the correct camera placement.

1391
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,600
What we do not have is the correct camera distance which is I guess,

1392
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,900
perhaps unsurprising, do not know where our rectangles wind so that's

1393
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,000
always good, right?

1394
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,700
This doesn't, this actually doesn't have the debug camera on.

1395
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,400
And it's going, okay?

1396
01:14:58,600 --> 01:14:59,500
That's interesting.

1397
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
Offset, just slightly.

1398
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,600
Vertically.

1399
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,300
All right, so we have a couple of problems here to address.

1400
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,200
One is that we still got a little bit of bugging us going on there.

1401
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:15,600
The other is of course, since our rooms are not the right size in when

1402
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,300
we create that room Collision because the room Collision volumes are

1403
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,500
always marked as the same size.

1404
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,000
We have this problem that where we start, our entity is not actually

1405
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,600
in a room, right?

1406
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,000
And that's a bug.

1407
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,700
So that's a problem obviously but you know, we can deal with that in a

1408
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,200
second are more pressing problem is we don't seem to have that value,

1409
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:40,600
correct.

1410
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,700
And also are rectangles are not drawing correctly, which makes me

1411
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:47,500
think that that we've done something incorrect with our the way our

1412
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:51,400
rectangles are working and I'm not sure why that is the case.

1413
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:00,400
So we'll have to kind of think about why that is, let's see here.

1414
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:17,000
So that looks really to have Lee.

1415
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,800
Okay, so let's let me just go ahead here and just double-check

1416
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,100
something.

1417
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:23,200
So here's me walking to the left.

1418
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,200
You can see as soon as I get into the room.

1419
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:32,800
Boundary, we end up centering ourselves horizontally correctly, but

1420
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,600
but vertically, not which is, which is pretty interesting, right?

1421
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,900
And I'm not sure exactly what the reasoning is for that because it

1422
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:45,200
seems like that should not be the case and I'm not sure why, that is

1423
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:45,700
the case.

1424
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:46,800
So,

1425
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:55,100
Since the camera p is getting applied here by the you know every time

1426
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,800
something gets transformed we subtract away.

1427
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,300
Whatever the camera is location.

1428
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,800
Is there Jimmy?

1429
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:09,000
We have to figure out sort of what, exactly, let's see.

1430
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,500
We have to figure out what exactly is happening.

1431
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,800
In terms of setting, that, that is bogus

1432
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:21,800
So, I'm passing the offset from the world mode here and that camera

1433
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,300
all set.

1434
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,800
Again should just be

1435
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,400
It shouldn't be anything special because it should be exactly the same

1436
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,100
things that we were passing before with no real change there.

1437
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,700
Because now we're passing a height.

1438
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,700
That's a Delta off of the height that we were expecting and so that

1439
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,600
seems totally reasonable.

1440
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:42,700
I'm sorry.

1441
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,400
Passing in height there that includes the the value that we were

1442
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,000
previous setting to and the Delta.

1443
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,300
So that should be the same.

1444
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,100
So the only difference here is rather than baking that into our

1445
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,900
drawing stuff.

1446
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,100
I guess, what?

1447
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,300
Oh, well, there's a couple of places here that

1448
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,800
I suppose that we might have used this.

1449
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,600
Suppose I should double-check with those are.

1450
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,700
So if I look at camera dot offset p and where that's getting used.

1451
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:06,500
Right.

1452
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,200
Which is sorry camera.

1453
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,500
Just camera done offset.

1454
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,500
Yeah.

1455
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,100
So it looks like I'm still doing that in a couple of places here that

1456
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,400
that probably don't want to be done.

1457
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,600
Now, this one for the world transform here, this is only done for

1458
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,800
doing those outlines of like the world, rectangles that stuff so that

1459
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,100
shouldn't have affected anything.

1460
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,100
But at least that simplifies that code a little bit for updated

1461
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,200
rendered particle systems.

1462
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,800
The world mode camera offset.

1463
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,400
Doesn't shouldn't actually need to be applied at all anymore.

1464
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:43,400
So, if I take a look at the particle systems code in update and

1465
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:43,600
render,

1466
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:49,300
Ecosystems and we look at that camera p, in theory.

1467
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,200
In theory, we should not have to do this anymore.

1468
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:14,500
Now, floors e on the other hand, we would have to do and that's Again,

1469
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,200
part of that sort of nastiness that we were trying to do, was to keep

1470
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,500
everything sorted into layers and that sort of stuff.

1471
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,100
But this offset P for the transform.

1472
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:28,600
Now, is already, is, is getting remembered properly, so and pass

1473
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,200
through properly in the camera itself, so I believe that part to be

1474
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,200
unnecessary now.

1475
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,000
So let's double check here.

1476
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,900
Yeah, but we're not getting those particles properly.

1477
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,400
So we still have something wrong.

1478
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,900
You can see kind of there's like particles over there.

1479
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:50,200
But those are incorrect and we're still not getting our floors

1480
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:50,600
correctly.

1481
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,600
And so I think most of this probably just has to do with the Z sorting

1482
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
for floor information, right?

1483
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,500
And to be completely honest with you, I don't super remember how we

1484
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,100
did this weird floor stuff, one of the reasons I wanted to move to the

1485
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:13,500
3D thing was specifically because the floor is e stuff is just really

1486
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,900
weird, right?

1487
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,000
So okay so you can see what's going on here.

1488
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,500
It looks like the floor is easy stuff is gets combined with distance

1489
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,500
above Target.

1490
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:29,200
So basically now that the cameras e includes that piece of information

1491
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,800
Yeah, not a smart way to do this, that's going to be wrong.

1492
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,400
You know what I'm saying?

1493
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:42,800
Because the floor is e is is not the correct piece of information.

1494
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,400
It doesn't need to take this into account, right?

1495
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:49,300
So the fact that that camera pz is getting used there at all, is

1496
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:53,300
actually wrong as well, because that's getting accounted for again

1497
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:54,700
after the transform.

1498
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:58,100
So really, this doesn't need the camera P anymore.

1499
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:07,500
Pretty much at all and let's just remove that entirely from the

1500
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,100
pipeline.

1501
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:12,600
There you go.

1502
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,900
And so now in theory.

1503
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:18,800
Yeah, there we go.

1504
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,600
So now we have restored our particles back because we fixed that CC

1505
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,100
displacement.

1506
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,000
That was happening there.

1507
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,100
And again, that's felt good because like a lot of that stuff was just

1508
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,700
too hacky and it was, you know, it's stuff that's in there because we

1509
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,400
were sort of trying to figure out how to handle the like sort of

1510
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:38,700
pseudo having to render to 3D stuff in 2D thing that I never was

1511
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,700
really happy with because it just creates all weird problems like

1512
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:41,900
that.

1513
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,700
We're like okay, these are weird coordinates and having to deal with

1514
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,900
all this stuff, it just doesn't seem to make.

1515
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,300
Whole lot of sense why I wanted to move away from him, okay?

1516
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,200
So the particles are restored in, that's good.

1517
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,200
Now let's take a look at the entities.

1518
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,700
And again, let me see what we actually use that camera P4.

1519
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,400
So when we're looking at camera, relative ground Z here, I think

1520
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:05,700
that's still needs to take that into account, obviously, it does, but

1521
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,700
if you take a look at what that was doing this again, doesn't include

1522
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,900
that displacement.

1523
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:13,700
Or I should say.

1524
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:21,000
Previously, that was not including the displacement right of 11.

1525
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:22,800
It was not including that.

1526
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,100
Any of those displacements.

1527
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,100
Right?

1528
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,200
So I don't really know what to say about this because

1529
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:38,300
You know, I think in some sense this is just totally wrong.

1530
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,700
This has to be grounded.

1531
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,800
This has to be a Delta value off of something, right?

1532
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,300
Essentially, this has to be

1533
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,700
That right, in order to get back the value we were doing, which is how

1534
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:58,000
far away are we from our Baseline value, which is kind of nuts, right?

1535
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,100
Which is again, why I say this is not a particularly good way to do

1536
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,400
this.

1537
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,700
and if you look at the camera, relatives ground Z I think

1538
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,700
The same thing applies here, right?

1539
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,100
If you were going to subtract this again, you have to remove that

1540
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,700
default value because this code was written, assuming that it was just

1541
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:20,100
a displacement from normal, which again, is is not correct, right?

1542
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,400
So yeah, so not great.

1543
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,900
And again, not really what we want to have happen there but there you

1544
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,200
go.

1545
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:27,900
Right.

1546
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,200
So now things are at least getting a little more same but they're

1547
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,500
still not as sane as they should be, right?

1548
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,500
And I think again,

1549
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:40,900
This is why I would like to move to 3D to sort of prevent having that,

1550
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:46,100
that sort of constant annoyance of having that problem, but at least

1551
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,400
getting back to a more saner approach.

1552
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:48,900
Right.

1553
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,000
And I don't know how far we need to go down that rabbit hole of of

1554
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,100
actually cutting us out because I think what we really want to do is

1555
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,200
just convert to a nice clean 3D version of it and then we don't have

1556
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,800
to worry about any of these because they won't cost me won't cost

1557
01:23:59,800 --> 01:23:59,800
them.

1558
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,800
But wait.

1559
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,400
Okay, how do we want to handle floors versus this or whatever?

1560
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,000
Right.

1561
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:12,000
So yeah, so that's all pretty nasty and probably should get just we'll

1562
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,500
just get cleaned out when we go to straight 3D.

1563
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:17,000
Now, the problem here again, though is

1564
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,900
We still have a couple other things even just for Baseline to make

1565
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,700
this work correctly, that we would want to do.

1566
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:29,700
So, for example, what we would want to do first is make sure that our

1567
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:33,800
rooms actually have the sizes that are rooms, should have, that's

1568
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,500
like, obviously something we would like to fix.

1569
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,600
So let's go to add standard room here.

1570
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:43,900
And just see what we can do about fixing.

1571
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:49,400
That fact, so what we can do for now again because we don't really

1572
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,200
have a strong opinion on this either way, since we haven't really done

1573
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,300
World gen yet, what we can do for now is just create any Collision

1574
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,400
volume groups as we go, right?

1575
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:05,800
So instead of doing room Collision here, we can just make one of those

1576
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,700
every time.

1577
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,300
Yeah.

1578
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,000
Where we make a simple grounded Collision volume for every room based

1579
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,800
on how big the room actually is right.

1580
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:33,900
So we knew here that we have how many tiles we have?

1581
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,000
We know that information because we know the radius.

1582
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,300
So it's just 2 times radius X Plus 1 and 2 times.

1583
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:44,000
Radius y plus 1 and that gives us the information that we want.

1584
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,400
So then we have the tile side in meters, which we don't actually know

1585
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:50,900
at the moment but we could easily have someone tell us, right?

1586
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,200
And in some set chunk position from tile chunk position from tile

1587
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,400
position needs to know that as well.

1588
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,900
So you know that's going to be in the world struct that we can grab

1589
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,800
out, right?

1590
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,100
So we can go ahead and say, all right, whatever the tile side is in

1591
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,300
meters, there you go.

1592
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,000
Wait.

1593
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,000
Position from tile position position from tile position needs to know

1594
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,600
that piece of information, right?

1595
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,300
It's just fantastic.

1596
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,300
I guess we just sort of said, well here's that value.

1597
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:55,000
Pretty fancy, huh?

1598
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:56,700
Yeah.

1599
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,500
So that's pretty ugly.

1600
01:26:59,500 --> 01:26:59,800
So

1601
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,900
We probably want to do there is to at least make this a value that we

1602
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:07,800
know globally for the time being and probably we want since that's not

1603
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:12,100
going to be constant, will probably want something a little more sane

1604
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:17,700
pretty soon in the world creation stuff that makes that, you know,

1605
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:18,900
less of a thing.

1606
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:33,600
I would really like it if my head was not in the way.

1607
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,900
So I think I'm going to move over here.

1608
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,600
All right.

1609
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,500
So, basically what we're substituting for at the moment is, you know,

1610
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,400
we sort of have this hacky World Jerry stuff because we need some

1611
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,900
World Gentoo test.

1612
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,800
But what we really want, is some utilities for building worlds.

1613
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,400
And when we're building those worlds in a local region, we're going to

1614
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,800
presumably want to set a tile size for talking about tiles but our

1615
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,700
game isn't hard coded to Tiles at all.

1616
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,800
It can be nice and variable and we probably want to take advantage of

1617
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,200
that.

1618
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,700
So what we're going to need to do is sort of have ways of

1619
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,600
constructing, okay, this area is a grid.

1620
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,900
This area is not a grid, here's how to work it.

1621
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,200
So we really are

1622
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,000
Sort of compensating for that at the moment.

1623
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,500
And so I don't think there's any need to try and look at that now.

1624
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,900
So I just want that as a global.

1625
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,800
So No One's Gonna even think about it or care about it and it doesn't

1626
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:51,400
have to be something that anyone even is thinking about temporarily.

1627
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:56,000
And then when we go to, actually make something a little more creative

1628
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,800
there for the world stuff that's the that's the better part to start

1629
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,800
addressing that, right?

1630
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,900
So I'm going to go ahead and do it this way here.

1631
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:08,500
Are we have a

1632
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,400
We have one of these for room.

1633
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,900
And that's got to be moved up.

1634
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,300
Okay.

1635
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:39,500
Okay.

1636
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:47,200
So think we're good and now at least our rooms correctly, have their

1637
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:51,100
bounds and you can now kind of see that being placed in here properly.

1638
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:53,000
Can see that the bound properly encompasses?

1639
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,600
The actual room which previously it didn't, right?

1640
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,600
And so now we get nice.

1641
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,400
We get correct movement through and we don't have that weird like in

1642
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,900
between Zone anymore, you're always either in a room or you're not and

1643
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,900
that's, you know exactly what we wanted.

1644
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:15,200
Now, one thing that you'll notice this is still happening bug Ali

1645
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:19,200
though is this screen is kind of offset from the bottom, like a room

1646
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,100
is not centered in the view.

1647
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:22,100
It's it's

1648
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,300
It's skewed in.

1649
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:25,900
Why?

1650
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,800
You see what I'm saying?

1651
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:35,100
So, the offset of of our view in y is erroneous.

1652
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:39,400
And so, I think what we want to do because we still have about 20

1653
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,000
minutes left, or so, 25 minutes left on stream.

1654
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,600
I'd like to just get to the bottom of that again.

1655
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,900
Not because that code will actually stick around necessarily because

1656
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,200
as we go through and do the cleaning up of the three, dienes of it

1657
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,900
all, I feel like that will go away but

1658
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,700
At least at the moment, I would just like to know where the source

1659
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:04,600
that bug is just to make the code AS correct as possible going into

1660
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,100
the 3D cleanup pass.

1661
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,300
So we're not spending our time, tracking down bugs that might be in

1662
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:11,400
something that had nothing to do with the change to 3D.

1663
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,100
So I'd like to have that if that makes sense.

1664
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:18,800
Even though the code is not super important at this point, right?

1665
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,600
So let's go ahead and make that happen.

1666
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:29,500
Let's first go ahead and ask ourselves the question of how are we

1667
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:30,600
centering that camera?

1668
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,100
Right?

1669
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:31,600
What is that?

1670
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,900
Actual piece of information that were using?

1671
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:39,900
And I believe the way that that we're doing that currently if you go

1672
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:44,200
ahead and look at some region is, you know, update camera for entity

1673
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:48,000
movement is going to take whatever the in-room value is there.

1674
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,900
And it's going to

1675
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,700
It's going to use that.

1676
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:04,900
To compute the room relative P so you can see here, we've got the room

1677
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,700
relative p and the test Senate EP there, right?

1678
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:13,700
So the room relative P that it computes for figuring out where it

1679
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:16,200
thinks the player is, is going to be based off of that test data

1680
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:16,700
teepee.

1681
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,300
However, the test that a tea

1682
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,200
The room campy, which is where we think the camera is for this room.

1683
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,800
In general is the test entity P location as well.

1684
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,700
If we take a look at what happens here, however, the camera offset

1685
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:43,600
itself is not initialized to be the difference between the test and a

1686
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,800
disposition and the actual

1687
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,300
How should I phrase this?

1688
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,600
So the offset of the camera because remember, everything's in local

1689
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,700
space to our Sim region.

1690
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,700
So everything's been mapped into a thing.

1691
01:32:59,700 --> 01:32:59,800
That's

1692
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,300
On the same region origin.

1693
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:05,500
But the same region origin is set arbitrarily, right?

1694
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,300
I mean we know what it sets you because we can go look.

1695
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,600
But in order for this code to be technically correct, it shouldn't

1696
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,600
depend on what the same origin was set to the same origin.

1697
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,900
Should be able to set to anything and this code should still set the

1698
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:20,500
camera in the correct position.

1699
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,900
So what we want to say here is the camera offset, right?

1700
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,400
Where we believe the camera to be for purposes of rendering, that

1701
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:35,400
should be based on the difference between wherever the camera.

1702
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,100
There, simulation region is, which is where all the positions relative

1703
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,000
to the camera should be recorded in that space, right?

1704
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:45,600
So now rather than doing things that we were doing them before this

1705
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,300
camera offset Z is not the only thing that should actually be getting

1706
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,000
updated here, right?

1707
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,300
What should actually be getting updated is

1708
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:01,400
The entire entity, the cameras entire placement itself.

1709
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,600
Right.

1710
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:15,000
So whatever room were in we should center around that room.

1711
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
That's where the camera should be if that makes sense.

1712
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:26,400
So whenever we're yeah, whenever in a room, our camera Center should

1713
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:31,500
always be wherever that room is now at the moment, our Sim region, I

1714
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:37,500
believe anyway is always set up to have itself in centered around

1715
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,300
there anyway.

1716
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,800
So I don't think there's actually any

1717
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,100
Difference between the code.

1718
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:46,100
I just wrote executing now and the code that we as it was exiting

1719
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,000
before, but

1720
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,000
There's a little bit of flashing at that transition point.

1721
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,000
I'm not sure why hold on one second.

1722
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:57,900
Want to take a look at that.

1723
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:03,700
Anyway, was going to say before was but I believe that's still more

1724
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:05,200
correct, right?

1725
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:08,600
So simulation that's what I want.

1726
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,900
So it's just at the changeover point I'm assuming that has something

1727
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:25,000
to do with the fact that it's not in any room at all.

1728
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,000
Maybe.

1729
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:55,300
So I'm not sure what happens in that one case because if we're not in

1730
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:59,400
any room at all, then in theory we should not be modifying the camera

1731
01:35:59,400 --> 01:35:59,800
offset.

1732
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,800
And so, I don't think there should actually be any changes here to

1733
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,400
that.

1734
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:09,900
Now that may not be true someone else.

1735
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:15,800
Maybe setting that camera off set somewhere because, you know, there

1736
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,500
was no rule in the code base about when you could set the camera off

1737
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,100
set to something.

1738
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:26,600
So I don't actually know that that's true but I, you know, I didn't

1739
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,500
think that there was anything happening there in particular.

1740
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,800
Let me take a quick look and see who actually touches this.

1741
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:47,300
Just so I can eliminate that from the set of possibilities.

1742
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,200
So that's nice and clean.

1743
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:14,900
I mean, nobody touches that thing except these two routines, right?

1744
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,900
So that's that's good.

1745
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,500
I mean that's where we want to be but we still have the bug so we're

1746
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:24,100
not out of the woods yet just because the code is getting cleaner.

1747
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:32,000
So what I would like to do is I would like some information to try and

1748
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,700
figure out whether or not the case that I'm seeing does coincide with

1749
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,600
what I suspect.

1750
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,200
So, all I want to do here is create an assertion.

1751
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,800
In fact, I can create this assertion.

1752
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,600
I guess without the if statement I can just say, I want to create an

1753
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,000
assertion.

1754
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,500
So it'll fire when we are not in a room, right?

1755
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:56,500
And then I can see whether that assertion appears to fire at the exact

1756
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,100
time when we were seeing the flash or whether it's not

1757
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,700
And that will help me tell if those are correlated.

1758
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,800
Okay.

1759
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:19,400
It doesn't actually seem to be doing it right now which is odd.

1760
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,600
Let me drop the time, step down.

1761
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,900
So, I'm definitely seeing the flash there.

1762
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:09,800
Hmm.

1763
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:11,000
Hmm.

1764
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:11,600
Hmm.

1765
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,500
so, I guess what I would say is,

1766
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:37,100
This may just be an artifact of the fact that this particular piece of

1767
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:41,000
code here is just based on a room Delta, which doesn't really have

1768
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,200
anything to do with anything, right.

1769
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,800
Because if you take a look at what's happening here at the room, Delta

1770
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,300
is just whatever the size of the room is, but that's not actually

1771
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:53,500
correct because if the other room is a different size from this room

1772
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,500
than the room, Delta isn't properly half what it should be.

1773
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,400
Although if we only are going half way, then the other room should go

1774
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,000
the other half way when we pan.

1775
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:02,700
So to come

1776
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:03,400
Give it, I don't know.

1777
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:07,100
That's not actually a good enough reason to really it seems like

1778
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:09,600
that's actually still should be some inaccurate.

1779
01:40:10,100 --> 01:40:13,800
So I don't know what the problem is here with this offset at that's

1780
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,700
still a good question.

1781
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,300
I guess.

1782
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:19,300
What I would say is, maybe let's go ahead and just not do this offset.

1783
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,500
Here's a thought for you.

1784
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,900
So that changeover would coincide with the time when the Sim region

1785
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:48,900
moves from one block to the next block because we're changing the

1786
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,100
camera's base location here.

1787
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:52,700
Right.

1788
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:05,100
So what I could totally believe is happening, is this offset will be

1789
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,200
used on the next pass.

1790
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:10,600
Right?

1791
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:14,900
So if we set it to the new room,

1792
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:25,400
we are going to compute a camera P, which is erroneous.

1793
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:31,500
Because it's going to be working off of the I'm sorry, we're going to

1794
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:35,000
compute an offset that's erroneous because it's going to be working

1795
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,500
off of the old.

1796
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:42,200
Location of the Sim region rather than the new one.

1797
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,600
Does that make sense?

1798
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,200
So what we need to do here is when we detect that we've moved from one

1799
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,400
room to the other or rather, whatever room that we're actually in.

1800
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,900
rather than using,

1801
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,700
A comparison with the room apron here.

1802
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,100
What we actually need to do is first compute the

1803
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,800
what we actually need to do here is

1804
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:25,700
Is compute the offset that we would have had before we changed rooms

1805
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:26,200
or not?

1806
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:27,400
Touch it at all?

1807
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:31,500
I think, because let's just go back over exactly how this is flowing

1808
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,500
through the pipeline here.

1809
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,400
Right?

1810
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,300
Because here's update, candidate update and

1811
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,000
Update camera for entity movement, right?

1812
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,800
So here's update camera for any movement, it's going to call it at the

1813
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,200
end and it's going to get called.

1814
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,200
It's going to do this operation after.

1815
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,200
Everything's already been drawn for this Frame.

1816
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,700
So the next frame is going to use whatever.

1817
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,000
It's like one frame behind, right?

1818
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,900
Is one way to think about it which we may not like, right?

1819
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,900
We may want this to try and be one frame.

1820
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:10,500
To not be one from have to be synchronized but you know, for taking an

1821
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:10,800
argument.

1822
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,900
Okay let's just take a look at what's gonna happen in the current

1823
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:13,400
case.

1824
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:18,100
So we're going to come through here and we're going to compute a

1825
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:20,800
offset and a location for the same region and those are going to be

1826
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:22,800
used for next time, right?

1827
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:28,400
So when we do this computation, we have to be careful that we're not

1828
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:32,400
doing anything in a space that has to do with where the Sim region is

1829
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,200
now because the offset is going to get used for a different location

1830
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,900
of the same region, right?

1831
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:43,700
So, I just want to verify, or I want to take a look to see to make

1832
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:47,000
sure that we're never that we're not doing that at all, right?

1833
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,700
So, for example, here's the camera offset and here's the in room P,

1834
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,700
okay?

1835
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,800
That in room p is wrong.

1836
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:01,300
As far as the next Sim region is concerned, right?

1837
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,600
Because the next Sim region is actually going to be the new location

1838
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,400
of the origin.

1839
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:12,200
So when the Sim region changes over, there is no way to avoid the fact

1840
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,600
that this is going to actually be incorrect.

1841
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,900
Sadly, right?

1842
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:24,000
So in some sense, me trying to make this code better right?

1843
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:28,600
By saying, oh, let's take the offset into account actually, made it

1844
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:29,100
worse.

1845
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:33,300
Like, this is probably what's causing that displacement because at

1846
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:33,400
that.

1847
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,300
Changeover point.

1848
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:35,000
It's wrong.

1849
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,400
If that makes sense.

1850
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,300
So let me go do it one more time here.

1851
01:44:53,700 --> 01:44:56,600
And again, I'll slow that percentage way down so we can see it easily.

1852
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,000
So there's that scroll

1853
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:00,800
Crap.

1854
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,800
And let's go ahead and put it back in.

1855
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,300
What happened?

1856
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,000
Huh.

1857
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:27,400
ah,

1858
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:38,500
I wonder when we did our update of the Grid's, if we forgot to do

1859
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,300
because you notice our Loop Live code, editing had a problem when we

1860
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,700
did our updated the quiz to handle the GCC compat, if we don't copy

1861
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:46,400
them anymore,

1862
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,900
If that makes sense.

1863
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:49,700
Hold on a second.

1864
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,700
I want to take a look at that.

1865
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:52,100
So

1866
01:46:02,700 --> 01:46:08,200
so it looks like we do copy both of these four pieces of information

1867
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,900
when we do get element from event here.

1868
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:17,100
So I'm not sure that that should have introduced any particularly

1869
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,400
Generous stuff.

1870
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:22,100
We take a look at that.

1871
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:35,200
And you can see that the bug is back, right?

1872
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:39,900
So I think that we can say that this is in fact, the culprit

1873
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:52,300
unfortunately it does look like that's a pretty transient bug because

1874
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:53,000
I can't

1875
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:57,200
Seem to get it to come back.

1876
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,600
But yeah, so you can see that that, that problem would persist there.

1877
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,500
So I guess we just kind of have to say that hey that camera offset

1878
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:10,600
always has to be

1879
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:17,000
Always has to be assumed to be the center of the same region.

1880
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,800
So maybe I'll just document that and we'll leave it like that for now.

1881
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:56,700
Okay.

1882
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,800
So, I'm not sure.

1883
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,100
That there's that, there's anything else look at here.

1884
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:07,500
Other than that, displacement now and we know that the same region is

1885
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,200
properly being created at the camera Center.

1886
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:15,000
So I'm not super sure why we're getting that displacement.

1887
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,900
Which looks like the centering is wrong for what the 0 0 value is, but

1888
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:20,100
I'm not 100% sure.

1889
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:25,300
So I just want to take a quick look at that to see what the status is

1890
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:25,700
there.

1891
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:29,300
So let's go ahead and zoom in here, right?

1892
01:48:41,300 --> 01:48:44,100
We got to have a better know why.

1893
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:44,900
That's so unsafe.

1894
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:48,000
Our Delta code is so unstable there.

1895
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,100
It's like rounding error, basically, right?

1896
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,600
That it flips between.

1897
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:01,400
Anyway, if you take a look at where that zooming in on, it's

1898
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:08,000
definitely, you know, it seems to be zooming in to the center point.

1899
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:12,100
Just fine.

1900
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
It just doesn't seem like the room is centered on that Center Point,

1901
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,500
if that makes sense.

1902
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,200
Or rather the camera is centered on the room Center Point.

1903
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,400
And I'm not sure why that would be, that's a good question because if

1904
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,900
everything is relative to those coordinates, you would think that it

1905
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:38,600
would have to be the case that you would not have any kind of

1906
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,400
displacement of a tile in that direction.

1907
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:44,200
And since we know the bounds of the room are, what the bounds of the

1908
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:45,700
room are, right?

1909
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,900
We should know where the center of the room is as well and we should

1910
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:53,300
know that it's that's in the correct location, right?

1911
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,200
So I'm not 100% certain why we sort of are having that that particular

1912
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:00,900
issue.

1913
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:12,300
I think about what possible causes there could be for that.

1914
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,700
And why we would not be getting that sort of centering.

1915
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:25,700
You know, it probably is because the Sim region isn't sized to the

1916
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:26,300
room.

1917
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:30,500
That could be one reason.

1918
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:32,400
So let's take a look here.

1919
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:38,900
So when we grab a Sim region here, you can see the Sim bounds use, get

1920
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,600
the standard room Dimension, right?

1921
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,100
And so, what's going to happen?

1922
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:49,400
There is, you know, it is going to be centered about the same place,

1923
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:50,600
but it's going to be sized differently.

1924
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:53,100
I don't know why that would cause any problems, though.

1925
01:50:53,100 --> 01:50:56,800
It doesn't seem like it should.

1926
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,400
But maybe there's something subtle there that I'm not appreciating,

1927
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,100
that is why that would be the case, right?

1928
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:10,600
so, we have to think about that a little

1929
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,300
I don't know why that's still there.

1930
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,400
Because nobody uses it.

1931
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,800
Just a red herring at this point.

1932
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,200
So yeah, get standard camera programs.

1933
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,200
We've got our screen bounds there.

1934
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:49,300
And that's just setting the Z.

1935
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:57,700
So it seems to me that since everything centered around the, the Sim

1936
01:51:58,300 --> 01:52:00,800
Region Center, the fat, really shouldn't cause a problem.

1937
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,000
The fact that the simulation region is not sized to the room, may be

1938
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,200
something that we want to fix for other reasons.

1939
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,200
But I don't think it's a reason.

1940
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:13,700
I don't think it has any particular effect on the centering that I can

1941
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:15,500
think of at least, not at the moment.

1942
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,700
and if we take a look at the

1943
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,500
if we take a look at the frame to frame Delta here,

1944
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,300
that's only affecting the particle system so that wouldn't have any

1945
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:33,100
effect.

1946
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,600
So yeah, I can't see a lot of reason why we would be getting a

1947
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,600
displacement there.

1948
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,800
And I would expect the center of the simulation region to be in the

1949
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,400
center.

1950
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:45,400
I guess the most logical thing to do.

1951
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,200
Now would be to try to draw something.

1952
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,100
That's where we think the Sim Center actually is right?

1953
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,000
So if I went ahead and push direct outline on here, I'm going to

1954
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
offset these a little bit screen, bounce inbounds.

1955
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:01,900
And some region bounds there.

1956
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:06,900
I'm not sure what the difference is between those two values at the

1957
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:12,400
moment, actually, though, to be fair but let's take a look.

1958
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:19,000
So, it's kind of as I expected there, like, you can see that the

1959
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:23,300
simulation region is lined up in X with the screen but it's not lined

1960
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:23,700
up in.

1961
01:53:23,700 --> 01:53:25,700
Why I went that was screen with the room.

1962
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,900
And so, that's an interesting question.

1963
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:31,700
As to why this is the center tile.

1964
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:34,400
We would expect it to be in the center of this white rectangle.

1965
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:39,000
And it isn't so my hunch as to what was happening is correct.

1966
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:44,600
But, you know, I my hunch as to why it was happening is not only just

1967
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:48,200
not correct but rather we would say non-existent I don't have a hunch

1968
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:53,800
as to why that's happening and so I feel like we need to try to make a

1969
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,300
determination about why the Sim region.

1970
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:56,700
Ian.

1971
01:53:58,300 --> 01:53:59,500
why the, the

1972
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:04,500
Why the Sim region doesn't seem to be centered in the way that we

1973
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,700
would expect?

1974
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:09,200
So, how do we compute the same region Center to begin with, right?

1975
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:11,200
And let's just take a look at that.

1976
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:13,600
So

1977
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:17,900
When we create the Sim region.

1978
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:25,100
Inside simulate I assume or other inside begins to him, we're using

1979
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:28,300
the camera dot P for that, right?

1980
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:33,100
And that camera dot p is going to be set inside, at least after the

1981
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:36,600
first frame is going to be set inside here, and it's going to be set.

1982
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,600
By mapping into chunks face, whatever.

1983
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,500
The

1984
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:49,500
Route camps position is relative what to whatever the origin position

1985
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,700
is of the same region at that time.

1986
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:54,000
So whatever the Sim region was

1987
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:57,100
Which is this?

1988
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:01,800
We're just going to say pretend we have an offset of that which is

1989
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,400
whatever the entity thinks.

1990
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,000
It's at map that into trunk space and that's going to be the position

1991
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
that we're going to use as our Center.

1992
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:13,700
And that seems pretty valid right?

1993
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:16,400
That's going to come or should be Computing.

1994
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:22,200
A point that has that information in it that information that we

1995
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:26,600
expect and I don't know why we would get a problem with that unless we

1996
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:32,800
are incorrectly applying that when we actually do our run map, right?

1997
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:37,000
So let's take a look at how we're doing our own map.

1998
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,300
So here's begin Sim where I guess begin World change rather.

1999
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:46,400
So here's the world change.

2000
01:55:47,900 --> 01:55:53,900
And you can kind of see us doing our thing here when we go through and

2001
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:58,700
try to compute where things are, we do subtractions of the chunk

2002
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,400
position.

2003
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:02,200
From the origin.

2004
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:07,400
And as far as I know that chunk, Delta should include the origins

2005
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:08,700
offset, right?

2006
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:13,500
Which is whatever gets passed in here, which should include that the

2007
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,700
micro offset not just for the chunk.

2008
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:19,500
Let's make sure it does starters.

2009
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:31,900
And it looks like it very, you know, clearly does, you can see it

2010
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:35,200
using a offset and be offset there where it subtracts the two.

2011
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:39,900
So that should be, you know, that should be correct for all intents

2012
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:40,600
and purposes.

2013
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:43,600
So that chunk Delta, that we get here, where we subtract the same

2014
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:47,400
regions origin from the chunk position that should give us that

2015
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,900
displacement out to that chunk.

2016
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:53,100
And then when we're taking entities out, right?

2017
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,300
We're just putting that that chunk Delta in there.

2018
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,200
So that seems like that should.

2019
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,800
it'd be correct and I'll take go ahead and

2020
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:03,500
just,

2021
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:09,300
We'll run a few times here and I'll go ahead and look just to just to

2022
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:13,900
see what we're actually getting for those values.

2023
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:17,600
So first of all, here's the same regions origin value.

2024
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,000
And you can see that there is an offset in there.

2025
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,400
And so, then we come through here and we do our

2026
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:26,400
Let's take a look at the chunk.

2027
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,500
That actually hasn't minute.

2028
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,200
so there is our chunk Delta that, we've computed

2029
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:34,300
Like so.

2030
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,000
And what we should be able to see there.

2031
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,200
I guess what I'd rather do is verify that it's actually using those

2032
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:42,800
values, I guess.

2033
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,600
So, here we go.

2034
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:49,600
So let's take a look at our a and our B and you can see as you'd

2035
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:51,500
expect the chunk part doesn't have enough set.

2036
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:52,100
That's what we want.

2037
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:55,000
And the other one does have an offset and they are getting respected,

2038
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,300
so that computation appears to be correct.

2039
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,000
So I dunno why the origin

2040
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:07,300
It's not getting set properly in that regard, right?

2041
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,400
That's a good question.

2042
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,500
So let's take a look at how we're updating our camera.

2043
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:33,300
So there it is and we come down here and we're taking a look at at the

2044
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:36,900
end of these and we find whatever the room entity is and let's just

2045
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:41,300
take a look at what the room entities position is its 0 as we would

2046
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:42,100
have expected.

2047
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:46,400
So the remedy is right in the middle, right?

2048
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:49,000
Supposedly of this thing.

2049
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,400
Now, that doesn't really make any sense because we're sort of saying

2050
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,100
that, well, if it was right in the middle than we would have expected

2051
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:59,600
the rooms boundaries to be centered with respect to the same region,

2052
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,300
they should be roughly about the same, right?

2053
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:07,400
But at the moment they aren't and you can see that just by looking at

2054
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,100
the fact that that white rectangle is directly centered.

2055
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,500
But the room rectangle, which is this yellow one here is not.

2056
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:18,100
So, so that's a bit of issue.

2057
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:19,600
I'll also point out that

2058
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:27,000
That the screen bounds are not quite centered either, which also

2059
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,200
doesn't make a whole lot of sense, right?

2060
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:33,400
So I feel like we have a couple remaining issues there.

2061
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:35,200
Let me go ahead and

2062
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,300
Reduce the displacement that these are feeling.

2063
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,500
So, there we go.

2064
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,300
So that just turned out.

2065
01:59:45,300 --> 01:59:47,100
That was just an offset issue, so that's fine.

2066
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:53,800
So, what's interesting about that because this is actually very

2067
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:54,700
relevant.

2068
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:55,700
So

2069
01:59:58,400 --> 01:59:59,800
when we offset things,

2070
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,700
Z.

2071
02:00:02,700 --> 02:00:05,200
they get shifted upwards, it looks like

2072
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:12,900
And that, of course, makes a fair bit of sense because I think that's

2073
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:16,400
exactly what we said should happen, right?

2074
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:24,700
We specifically said that things should get off set in why when they

2075
02:00:24,700 --> 02:00:25,600
get higher, right?

2076
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:28,800
That was our whole thing with

2077
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,800
With having the two transforms.

2078
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:36,800
And so you can see that you know we displace the Y with the author

2079
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,000
from Z hide off floor, right?

2080
02:00:42,900 --> 02:00:46,900
So I suspect, the reason we aren't getting the centering that we want

2081
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:47,700
to get there.

2082
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:53,200
It's because our height off floor computation, right is giving us.

2083
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:57,000
A bogus value for that.

2084
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,700
Because now the distance above Target for the floor Z, right?

2085
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:06,100
This does is above Target value is including the whole displacement

2086
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:09,600
rather than just the relative displacement and then you end up with

2087
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:10,500
extra displacement there.

2088
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:14,700
So I guess what I would say is I'm willing to say, okay, I'm not going

2089
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:17,700
to fix that one, I'm going to leave it the way it is because I believe

2090
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:21,000
when we go to 3D here that will take care of itself because then we

2091
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,900
won't have this dual notion of things that happen will only just have

2092
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:28,800
the 3D working as it should work, right?

2093
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,500
And then I think we'll be more, okay?

2094
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:40,800
So I'm going to go ahead and go to the Q and A on that note.

2095
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,900
And and take any questions that people have.

2096
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:22,700
Can you girls high for how long is this Bliss of weekend?

2097
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,900
Episodes going to continue.

2098
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,600
Got any news in the making for us?

2099
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:32,300
Yeah I actually probably will just keep doing it this way.

2100
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:36,500
II like the weekend streams.

2101
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:42,200
And I don't have very much ability at the moment to fit weeknight

2102
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:43,500
streams into my schedule.

2103
02:02:43,900 --> 02:02:45,800
So I think it will just be this way.

2104
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,300
Probably indefinitely.

2105
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm glad you call it the Bliss of weekend episodes that makes it sound

2106
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
like you like it which is good I'm sure for anystream time change.

2107
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,900
There are some people for whom

2108
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,300
It's better in some people for whom, it's worse, worse.

2109
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:04,400
But yeah.

2110
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:56,100
Oh, can you cause I did not realize you were asking if there were all

2111
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:59,000
any additional news besides the weekend episodes?

2112
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,600
No, I don't have any news at the moment.

2113
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:02,000
No.

2114
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:22,400
It's not a bit off topic, but why do you use your headphone mic rather

2115
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,200
than the nice Studio mic?

2116
02:04:23,200 --> 02:04:24,900
You have the Jess and Casey show?

2117
02:04:24,900 --> 02:04:30,500
Well, actually there's a couple of reasons but one of the main ones is

2118
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:35,200
just I don't really have a good way to put that mic in here somewhere.

2119
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,400
Where I could talk into it.

2120
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:40,300
That wouldn't pick up the machine noise like really dramatically

2121
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:44,100
because it wouldn't be on a headset.

2122
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:48,400
It be outcome sitting on the table where we get a lot of noise and

2123
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,200
also I don't really

2124
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:53,000
You know, I can't have it in some place that Mike is supposed to be

2125
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
like, right?

2126
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:55,600
Close to your head here.

2127
02:04:55,900 --> 02:05:00,100
If I was to try and put an aperture that would make that happen, I

2128
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,900
wouldn't be able to really work that effectively.

2129
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:08,500
So, you know, I probably could try to use a better microphone in that

2130
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:12,700
way, but I would have to, like, buy a bunch of stuff to kind of try

2131
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:16,200
and mount it in a way, that would still let me type and like, not

2132
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Yeah, it would be bad.

2133
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,500
So let's go with the camera.

2134
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:31,900
Doesn't need to be centered perfectly working as intended.

2135
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,900
Yeah, that's what I was just talking about.

2136
02:05:34,600 --> 02:05:37,100
I don't know if you just maybe you just came to a stream but that's

2137
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:39,500
what I was just saying, is the reason is because of the Y offset,

2138
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:42,000
which we are going to remove.

2139
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,800
So I'm not going to touch it at the moment.

2140
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,800
And in terms of testing the theory by just removing that transform.

2141
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:54,900
Yeah, we can do that, although it would probably have some other side

2142
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:59,800
effects if we change the Y offset, that's that line of

2143
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,500
There.

2144
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,600
And then you can kind of see everything is centered properly, right?

2145
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:06,200
So now we're now it's entered the way you would expect.

2146
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:14,500
So it's just that that that y displacement which like I said, I

2147
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,700
decided I'd I'm going to change the way that that works.

2148
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,500
Sort of following the series on YouTube and have made it to episode

2149
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:48,200
for loving it so far when I tried to build solution in Visual Studio,

2150
02:06:48,200 --> 02:06:49,000
I'm able to do so.

2151
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Unless I put the pound to find some type that into every file.

2152
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,500
Is this a visual studio thing or am?

2153
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,400
I doing it wrong?

2154
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:55,900
Sorry, for going way back.

2155
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,500
So you are not doing it wrong in the sense that there's something

2156
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,500
wrong with what you're doing.

2157
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:05,100
You're just not doing it the same way I did it.

2158
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:08,500
And that's probably why you're getting that problem.

2159
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:13,700
What happens is in visual studio.

2160
02:07:14,200 --> 02:07:22,200
So by default, if you use this solution Explorer thing and you add CPP

2161
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:23,600
files to it, right?

2162
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:27,300
And you let Visual Studio, do the build each CPP.

2163
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:29,700
File is passed to the compiler separately.

2164
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:31,200
Right.

2165
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
And so, because each CPP file is past separately anything that might

2166
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
be a dot h file or a DOT CPP file or anything that needs to be used

2167
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:41,600
cross.

2168
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,000
File has to be redefined.

2169
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,700
That's why we have H files.

2170
02:07:46,700 --> 02:07:50,200
Technically, when going back to the old days, when that's how you

2171
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,300
always did, it is passing everything separately.

2172
02:07:53,700 --> 02:07:56,700
That's why you had to have a child and you furthermore had to like

2173
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:59,300
Define everything like every time you made a function, that would be

2174
02:07:59,300 --> 02:07:59,800
called.

2175
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,200
But from

2176
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:01,600
File to another file.

2177
02:08:01,700 --> 02:08:04,300
You had to into the H file, put that definition.

2178
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,300
So the compiler would know that that that you know it was something it

2179
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:09,100
was available to be called, right?

2180
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,200
The reason we don't have to do any of that stuff on handmade hero is

2181
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:16,000
because I don't use the IDE to build.

2182
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,800
I use a batch file and this is the batch file and what it does.

2183
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,600
Right.

2184
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:26,000
Is it just builds the one file and all the files are included in that

2185
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:26,300
file.

2186
02:08:26,300 --> 02:08:30,300
So if you look at handmade dot CPP you can

2187
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,100
see that it includes all of the CPP files in it, right?

2188
02:08:34,700 --> 02:08:37,700
So what that does is it just makes one giant file.

2189
02:08:38,300 --> 02:08:42,400
That has all the code in it and it just compiles that one file.

2190
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:47,000
Now, if you try to do that in Visual Studio, in the naive way, where

2191
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,100
you just you've got this file handmade dot CPP in there.

2192
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:53,200
But you also added all the other files in there because hey there the

2193
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:55,400
files and you thought you would want them in there which makes sense.

2194
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:59,800
Now, it's going to try to compile the handmade one which

2195
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,400
Pile properly because it includes everything.

2196
02:09:02,700 --> 02:09:06,500
But it will also try to compile all the other files individually.

2197
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,700
Even though it doesn't need to and isn't supposed to do that, because

2198
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,800
it just thinks anything that you listed in here is supposed to

2199
02:09:11,800 --> 02:09:13,900
compiled as source code, right?

2200
02:09:15,500 --> 02:09:19,100
So what you have to do if you're going to compile inside Visual Studio

2201
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:25,400
is either only add handmade dot CPP and win32 handmade dot CPP as two

2202
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:28,000
separate projects with two separate CPP files and that's it.

2203
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:29,800
So it will only try to build those.

2204
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,800
So, or you can add everything you want, but then you have to customize

2205
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,100
your build in Visual Studio using like the build stuff.

2206
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:45,700
There's like, a whole I don't even know like this whole system thing.

2207
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:51,100
If This Were a real project and not just an executable, it have a

2208
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:51,900
whole bunch of settings.

2209
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:54,800
Here, you'd have to set all those settings correctly and I believe

2210
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,500
people have worked that out on the handmade Network forums.

2211
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:03,500
You can go and see how people have done that and so, you know, you

2212
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,500
don't have to try and figure that out yourself.

2213
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:09,400
If you are new to visual studio and don't necessarily know how to, you

2214
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:13,300
know, sort of massage it into the correct configuration to make that

2215
02:10:13,300 --> 02:10:13,700
work.

2216
02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:16,600
There are there's folks who have definitely

2217
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,100
Miss on handmade Network.

2218
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:25,700
I just don't actually know exactly where you to visual studio and

2219
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:26,400
doesn't know.

2220
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:27,900
It's me talking to me.

2221
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:30,700
No just stop.

2222
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:38,500
Okay, so if you search in here like Visual Studio, I think there's

2223
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,300
probably

2224
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:44,300
Let's see.

2225
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,500
so, I think this is

2226
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,000
Handle them here kind of, right?

2227
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,300
You can sort of see

2228
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:03,500
Yeah, you can kind of see people working it out.

2229
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,900
I'm not sure which one of these is definitive because I don't use

2230
02:11:06,900 --> 02:11:09,800
Visual Studio in this manner so I don't even have an opinion about it

2231
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:15,100
one way or the other, but that's kind of what's available for for

2232
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:16,200
going down that route.

2233
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,500
If you if you will, does that make sense?

2234
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:23,400
And yet looks like,

2235
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:30,500
You know, it looks like probably there's different ways to make things

2236
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,500
work better and like, if you want livecode reloading to work, for

2237
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:38,700
example, you probably do a lot more work setting up visual studio,

2238
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:41,100
then if you just want it to build, right?

2239
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:44,500
Because in order to get the live coding to work, you have to build the

2240
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:49,100
dll and do the thing where we unlock the unlocked change the name of

2241
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:49,600
the pdb.

2242
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:52,000
And there's all this other stuff that we do to make the loop live

2243
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,800
coding work in the batch file and and visual studio would have to be

2244
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:56,600
set up to

2245
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,200
to do the right stuff for that as well.

2246
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,600
So, you know, there's probably

2247
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:02,700
Degrees of compliance.

2248
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:06,300
You can achieve with visual studio and there are probably different

2249
02:12:06,300 --> 02:12:10,500
amounts of work involved in them, but people have sort of posted that

2250
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:15,000
there and so you can go ahead and use that as a resource if you're

2251
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:15,600
having trouble.

2252
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,400
Looks like that's it for questions, which is good because the stream

2253
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,200
just ended.

2254
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:04,600
All right, let's close things down.

2255
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:15,900
All right, so before I close things down, again I just want to re

2256
02:13:15,900 --> 02:13:19,500
mention some stuff we talked about.

2257
02:13:19,500 --> 02:13:21,100
No, don't don't do it.

2258
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:21,900
Okay, there we go.

2259
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,700
I was almost going to have me talk to me again.

2260
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:29,500
I just want to mention again, if you are interested in handmade

2261
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:32,700
Network, which is sort of a separate.

2262
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,300
It's, it's a it's not a handmade hero thing.

2263
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,300
Actually, it's kind of like a place for projects that people

2264
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:44,200
Are trying to do programming in sort of a similar, I guess I would

2265
02:13:44,200 --> 02:13:47,200
just say, like, attitude towards how we do it on handmade hero where

2266
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:51,100
you're, you know, carrying about the code and trying to sort of focus

2267
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:53,400
on learning how the computer works and these sorts of things.

2268
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:57,200
So, if you're interested in that sort of stuff, you probably have been

2269
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:58,200
to hand me a network before.

2270
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:02,500
But previously, in order to get a project listed on handmade Network,

2271
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:05,500
it was just sort of, you had to email the maintainers and that sort of

2272
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:08,700
stuff because the site, you know, has only been around for actually a

2273
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:09,200
fairly short period.

2274
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:10,100
A of time.

2275
02:14:11,600 --> 02:14:14,500
And so they were still working on getting all the other features of it

2276
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,900
going and, you know, cleaning it up and work on the layout and all the

2277
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,600
sorts of things you have to do to run a website.

2278
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:20,100
Obviously.

2279
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:25,400
And so if you before, if you wanted to be one of the people who

2280
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:29,100
maintained a product on there and use their product hosting services

2281
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:32,400
and kind of be part of that Community, you had to email someone to

2282
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:33,200
make that happen.

2283
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:36,000
And you have to go dig to find two, who to email.

2284
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,700
And, you know, it wasn't the kind of thing.

2285
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:39,300
It was really set.

2286
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,900
Up for public consumption, but they've now gotten all their stuff done

2287
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:43,100
that.

2288
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:45,400
They want to get done in terms of allowing product resubmitted

2289
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:46,100
publicly.

2290
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:49,900
And so, if you are interested in submitting a project to handmade

2291
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:52,500
Network, and you'd like to be hosted on there and you can now do that

2292
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:55,700
directly from the hand being Network site, which is just a made-up

2293
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:57,300
Network, you just click on projects.

2294
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:59,800
And now this submit a project button should be here, you

2295
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,900
Have an account on handmade Network to do it but obviously that's free

2296
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:03,600
and easy to do.

2297
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,600
You just click register.

2298
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,900
If you don't already have one and you can register.

2299
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:11,900
And then this button this dialogue here, if you are a registered user,

2300
02:15:11,900 --> 02:15:15,500
which many of you probably already are, you can will just see a submit

2301
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:16,000
button there.

2302
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:19,100
And so then you can submit your project and they can take a look at

2303
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:19,300
it.

2304
02:15:19,300 --> 02:15:22,900
And if it's the kind of thing that fits with what they're doing, they

2305
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:26,100
can set you up for hosting the project on there, and there's a lot of

2306
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:27,500
great products hosted on there already.

2307
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,700
So I would highly recommend checking them out.

2308
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,100
If you haven't, you can see there's an for entire pages of projects

2309
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:38,700
here that are like all over the map in terms of what they cover.

2310
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:39,600
So by no means.

2311
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:45,700
Does it have to be something similar in scope or type of project to

2312
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:49,000
handmade hero because most of the things on there are totally

2313
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,900
different sorts of things, The Homebrew operating system, a remake of

2314
02:15:52,900 --> 02:15:56,000
Quake, you know, the drawing package.

2315
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,300
We use a voxel engine, you know, everything.

2316
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,700
You can imagine is already sort of on there.

2317
02:16:02,900 --> 02:16:07,000
And so there's no reason to limit yourself.

2318
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,300
If you are doing a project like this, it doesn't have to be anything

2319
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,100
like handmade hero.

2320
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:14,100
It just has to be something where you're concerned about, you know,

2321
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:17,200
making quality software and wanting to write things with an

2322
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:20,800
understanding of how they execute on hardware and stuff like that.

2323
02:16:20,900 --> 02:16:26,000
Everything is welcome on there as far as I'm far as I'm aware.

2324
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:27,800
So, I would check that out.

2325
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:29,700
Check out the products that are on there if you haven't already and

2326
02:16:29,700 --> 02:16:29,800
then

2327
02:16:29,900 --> 02:16:33,600
if you are working on a project that you'd like to see be part of sort

2328
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:37,799
of their umbrella, you can go ahead and submit it here.

2329
02:16:37,799 --> 02:16:41,500
And I believe that, that, that the backend that they have basically

2330
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:44,400
includes like all the stuff you need for hosting, so you don't need to

2331
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:46,500
maintain like a separate GitHub or anything like that.

2332
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:48,700
I think they even have, like, all that stuff just built in.

2333
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,299
So it's, it's completely like the forums.

2334
02:16:51,299 --> 02:16:52,000
Are there?

2335
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,500
The GitHub sort of equivalent?

2336
02:16:54,500 --> 02:16:57,700
Is there like, all that stuff is just kind of there, which is pretty

2337
02:16:57,700 --> 02:16:58,000
cool.

2338
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,799
Because then, you can just have all that.

2339
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,700
Stuff taken care of and you don't have to, you know, have deforms in

2340
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:06,000
one place your GitHub in other place and involve law.

2341
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,799
So I think it'll probably be pretty useful for people who are

2342
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:13,200
interested in maintaining projects in this fashion.

2343
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:17,600
And even if you host the project, externally, obviously there's still

2344
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:19,400
ways that you can use it as far as I can tell.

2345
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:22,100
Because, for example, handmade hero already had all the stuff set up

2346
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:25,000
with the GitHub and the and send owl and all that stuff.

2347
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:29,700
And and it's still on here for the forums and everything right to, so,

2348
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:34,000
You can also have that stuff taken care of how much do you pay for

2349
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:34,200
health?

2350
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,900
And please just don't twitch.

2351
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:38,500
Really wants me to see some ads.

2352
02:17:38,500 --> 02:17:43,200
I guess so yeah, you can use it also.

2353
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,700
If you're just interested in form of stuff, but you have a project

2354
02:17:45,700 --> 02:17:48,600
that fits well, you can still probably use it here.

2355
02:17:48,600 --> 02:17:50,600
And again, like these are kind of cool features, right?

2356
02:17:50,600 --> 02:17:54,600
Like as much as you probably don't want this to watch an advertising

2357
02:17:54,600 --> 02:17:54,900
here.

2358
02:17:55,100 --> 02:17:58,900
If you are a twitch user, actually anyone who's Amazon Prime will see

2359
02:17:58,900 --> 02:17:59,299
ads, right?

2360
02:17:59,299 --> 02:17:59,799
I'm just not.

2361
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,799
And I wouldn't normally see ads on Twitch.

2362
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:05,900
So if you're live, it'll show up.

2363
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:08,200
When people are browsing a channel, which is a pretty awesome feature.

2364
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:11,400
So there's just a lot of neat things that they're doing and because

2365
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:16,100
they care about this from the perspective of people who are making

2366
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,200
projects like these.

2367
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:20,100
It's very likely that the sort of stuff that you're going to want, is

2368
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:21,200
a sort of stuff that they're working on.

2369
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,500
So it's also kind of nice in that respect because, you know, it's not

2370
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,799
geared, just towards people who are doing stuff that may be very

2371
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:29,299
different from the sorts of stuff you're doing.

2372
02:18:29,299 --> 02:18:29,900
It's geared more.

2373
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,799
Or towards the sort of stuff that you probably are interested in.

2374
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:35,799
If you're the kind of person who likes, what we do on handmade hero

2375
02:18:35,799 --> 02:18:39,100
because that's their Focus, right?

2376
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:42,400
So check all that out whenever you get a chance.

2377
02:18:43,299 --> 02:18:46,700
And again that's who hosts the forums for handmade here.

2378
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,000
Anyway.

2379
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,100
So if you're on handmade here that org and you click on the forms

2380
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:53,000
button, that's that's already where it's going, right?

2381
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,700
And so that's just if you didn't already know, if you click on that

2382
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:57,600
handmade Network part.

2383
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:59,799
You get to the broader site which has a bunch of other

2384
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,200
Objects that are in a similar vein.

2385
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,700
And a lot of them also have learning resources associated with them,

2386
02:19:05,700 --> 02:19:07,000
just like handmade hero does.

2387
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:08,900
So there's a, quite a few on there.

2388
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,799
I think at least three or four that also have streams associated with

2389
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:19,299
them, where you can watch and learn about how they were developed, or

2390
02:19:19,299 --> 02:19:20,299
how they're being developed.

2391
02:19:20,299 --> 02:19:23,299
And so, if you do like that sort of thing, it's also a good way to

2392
02:19:23,299 --> 02:19:24,700
find out what's going on there.

2393
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:27,900
Some of them also don't necessarily have educational streams but do

2394
02:19:27,900 --> 02:19:28,799
have streams.

2395
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:32,400
So, for example, when Sean Barrett does development on his voxel

2396
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:34,799
engine, he does stream the development.

2397
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:38,100
Now it's not necessarily an educational stream per se, because he

2398
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:39,600
doesn't necessarily Translate

2399
02:19:39,700 --> 02:19:44,700
Teach you what he's doing, but he does record what he's doing.

2400
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:48,800
So you can learn from how he's coding just by observing, right?

2401
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:52,800
So if you want to see how he's approaching the code and how he's

2402
02:19:52,800 --> 02:19:55,100
running the code, you still can do all of that, right?

2403
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:58,200
For that, for that voxel engine.

2404
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:02,400
So in addition to the ones that have overtly educational streams,

2405
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:06,800
which are designed to be more teaching oriented and have complete

2406
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:09,500
explanations, and break things down for,

2407
02:20:09,700 --> 02:20:12,600
Or an intended audience of people who may not understand them.

2408
02:20:12,700 --> 02:20:17,100
At first glance, there are also streams that are happening on there,

2409
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:20,300
which are, I guess, you might call them more expert streams, which are

2410
02:20:20,300 --> 02:20:21,600
to say that you could still learn from them.

2411
02:20:21,600 --> 02:20:24,800
You just have to be a little further along but as long as you can

2412
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:29,200
follow along with what Sean's doing without too much detailed

2413
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:32,500
explanation, you can sort of still see how he approaches code.

2414
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:36,800
How he goes about like debugging, how he thinks about things and there

2415
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,200
is commentary from him from time to time too.

2416
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:39,500
So you

2417
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:42,100
you do get also some of the, like the back process there.

2418
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:45,100
So there's kind of a ray of streams as well that you could check out

2419
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:46,600
on there, that might be useful.

2420
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:50,500
And so, you know, I would recommend spending time exploring it if you

2421
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:52,900
like handmade hero, there may be other things on there.

2422
02:20:52,900 --> 02:20:58,300
That would be really useful to complement it or to sort of take it

2423
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:59,900
into areas that, you know, we don't

2424
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,600
Really cover, you know.

2425
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:05,400
So if you're looking for more materials I would highly recommend it

2426
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:10,200
that's it for for today as always if you're just interested in

2427
02:21:10,200 --> 02:21:13,800
handmade hero, you can always pre-order the game when it comes to the

2428
02:21:13,800 --> 02:21:14,300
source code on.

2429
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:16,300
Handmade hero dot-org, I uploaded every night.

2430
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,500
So it's always fresh.

2431
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:18,600
You can play around with it.

2432
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:19,500
We also have that for him.

2433
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:22,500
So I was talking about hosted by handmade Network which you can check

2434
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:24,400
out and now is a good time to do it.

2435
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:27,100
Like I was saying, it's kind of the sort of kicked up the

2436
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:29,900
functionality on the site and Notch to a place where I think.

2437
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,400
You probably going to be really happy checking out.

2438
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,000
What they've got.

2439
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:35,600
We also have a patreon page to want to support our video series a

2440
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,400
schedule, but if you want to know when we're going to be live and an

2441
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:43,200
episode guide maintained via the fabulous me blow, which has all of

2442
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:44,600
our old episodes on it.

2443
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:48,300
So you can go back and see what we did and when it's got nice time

2444
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:50,700
coded entries so you can jump to things and all that sort of stuff

2445
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,700
that's it for today.

2446
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:56,700
I will be back here next weekend to do some more programming until

2447
02:21:56,700 --> 02:21:59,500
then have a good week and I'll see everyone.

2448
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:00,500
On the internet.

2449
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:01,400
Take it easy, everybody.
