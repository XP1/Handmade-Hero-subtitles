1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
Dart.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,800
Okay, so as I said, this is going to be.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,600
So Sean McGrath who is a programmer, who did, like I said, a bunch of

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,400
the programming on N plus plus, and who's now working on new game and

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
he also did it before.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
M plus plus, that was his most recent product.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,700
You did a game called dyad which you could check out,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,100
He is interested in doing a potentially a game that's free to play

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,300
that was he's, you know, he's thinking of doing his next game free to

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,800
play and for whatever reason he felt, you know, he was maybe a little

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,400
uneasy about this or he wanted to kind of get it a little bit, I'm not

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,600
sure exactly why.

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm sure he will explain that to us in the opening here, but he wanted

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,200
to essentially have a mock debate about it, where he would get

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,300
somebody who wasn't necessarily super invested meaning, I don't, it

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:54,700
doesn't matter.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,500
Me right whether he does his game free to play or not.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,600
Like I'm not personally affected by, this doesn't affect me

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,800
necessarily, but I do care about the game industry in general.

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,600
I do have opinions about stuff and I am an argumentative person.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,000
So he basically wanted someone who fit that criteria to argue with him

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,300
about this a little bit kind of probably to make sure that Keys

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,800
thought it through all the way and also, so he can kind of feel out

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,400
exactly.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,300
You know how other people would might react to this or all sorts of

26
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,300
stuff like that, right?

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,400
So that's what we're going to be doing now.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,100
And of course, that involves us having to do some Skype set up here.

29
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,000
So please bear with us for a few moments.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,200
While we try to get this stuff set up, I'm sure it will be a little

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,700
bit of an adventure, but hopefully we will be able to make it work.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,300
So I'm going to go ahead and start that process here and hopefully we

33
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,700
can, like I said, make this happen without too much pain, but you know

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,600
again anything that involves

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,100
To play is, it's a thing, right?

36
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
All right, so let's go here.

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,300
Let me get this set up so we can talk to Sean.

38
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,300
We will not have much of a debate, if I cannot talk to Sean that much

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,900
is clear.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,700
Let's see here.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Do do do and this up.

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,100
Okay.

43
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:30,700
So I will come to online status online and then we will see some ads

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,300
here, wonderful ads for whatever.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,100
Let's see if we can call Sean.

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,200
Call.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,300
Hello.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,700
Sean.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Howdy.

50
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
How's it going?

51
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,600
It was very interesting because I was watching handmade hero and

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
there's stream delay.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
You were setting it up.

54
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Well, calling me, it was very confusing for a moment, it's freaky.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,400
That's just, that's just how it goes.

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah, it's very, very terrifying.

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,700
So I guess the first question here is, we have no webcam for you.

58
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,400
Is that as well?

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Oh shit.

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,700
Oh crap.

61
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Can I swear?

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,700
Yes, you can.

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,700
If you would like to, I suppose, but I mean I'll try not to but yeah,

64
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,300
it happens.

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Is the audience for the streams going to be for, you know, all right.

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
I'll do my best.

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Sorry.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Yeah.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Oh wait, do we have a webcam now?

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,000
We should.

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,700
Perfect.

72
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,600
Is it okay?

73
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:35,900
Cool.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
I guess I'm going to set up my stream but I can just go, it's fine.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,200
Okay, well you can't really go yet because now we have to check with

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
the chat that any of this stuff works.

77
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,200
Oh, it doesn't of course.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:50,800
Alright.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,300
So those of you who are on the handmade hero chat, who I am looking at

80
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,700
now.

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,800
Can somebody tell me what?

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Like can you tell me what you see like, do you see Sean?

83
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,800
Can you hear?

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,000
Sean right, you know what?

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,100
What's going on I guess is what I would say.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,700
The other thing I'll do is I'll maybe make myself a little bit bigger

87
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,600
here as well.

88
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,200
Let's see here.

89
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,400
How do I, how do I make my, how do I make myself?

90
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
Holy shit, look how big I am.

91
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600
Oh my God, this is faster.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,600
It just got to be there.

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,500
It is edit scene.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,800
All right.

95
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
I don't even know what I'm looking at here.

96
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,900
All right, webcam.

97
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
I should Zoom an emotional mess in my room.

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,600
I don't even know.

99
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
This is just a disaster.

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,200
All right, it's where I, it's working like short of and I duplicate

101
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,700
this

102
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,600
Add.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh my God.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,400
All right.

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
I just want to add I want to like add our duplicate, one of these

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,500
things so I can have, I guess I can add Arrow.

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,100
So let me see if I can add a global source of air.

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,400
Oh no, I can't.

109
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,400
There's monitor, add Global Source webcam.

110
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,700
Oh, are you won't be able to?

111
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,800
There we go.

112
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,700
What I did it.

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,500
Huh, I didn't work for me.

114
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,800
Yeah, perfect, right.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
Okay, people on the stream.

116
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,500
What how are we at?

117
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Can we start this or not?

118
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,900
Can we, can we here?

119
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,600
Sean.

120
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,000
Can we hear me?

121
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,000
Can you see?

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Both of us?

123
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,300
People who are watching on handmade Heroes.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I think this is working.

125
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,900
I think that actually

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Eric John.

127
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,400
It's a miracle.

128
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,100
It is a bit of a miracle.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,300
It is I just assume nothing ever Works.

130
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Alright so are we almost ready start?

131
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,200
This I'm going to go check one more thing and then we'll get started.

132
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,200
All right.

133
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,600
Sean is much louder.

134
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Sean is way louder and I am quiet like a mouse.

135
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,300
They say like well I just I just moved my microphone away from my

136
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,900
mouth so maybe that'll help.

137
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
No, I think that's just I'm just going to adjust my volume here.

138
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,800
I think that's all.

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,700
You're probably fine.

140
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,000
Alright then alright let's try this.

141
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
I turned down Shawna Tad.

142
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,000
How do we feel now guys is this is this better?

143
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
And people are asking.

144
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,600
I don't know if you're seeing the handmade hero chat, but people want

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
to know if you have a cat.

146
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,600
No.

147
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Sean says, he does not have a cat.

148
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,800
I have a lot of pets, but no cat.

149
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,600
A lot of pets, but no cat.

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
Yes, I have a zoo.

151
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,200
The sound is, ok.

152
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
All right, so I think we're ready to go here.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,600
I think.

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,900
Cool.

155
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,500
Alright.

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,300
Sean, you ready?

157
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,900
Sure.

158
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,500
Let's do this.

159
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,500
Now I should tell you up front.

160
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,800
Before we start that I do have a treat for you.

161
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,600
Yes.

162
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,900
Yes.

163
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,300
I heard I prepared a treat for you.

164
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,200
All right but I want first before I so I'm going to I'm going to give

165
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,000
you essentially a present first but before I do that I just wanted you

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,600
to take some time to tell people who may not be familiar because you

167
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,200
talk to me about this already and email, you said here's what I'd like

168
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,200
to.

169
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Do why don't you explain in sort of your own words, right?

170
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,100
What it is that you actually want to get out of this or like what, you

171
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
know, what you're thinking, what the point is so that they're on the

172
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,200
same page as you.

173
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
And I are, because I sort of understand, but, you know, they might not

174
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,000
sure.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,100
So, basically, I've been a vocal opponent of free to play for, at

176
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,600
least, you know, at least a decade.

177
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I've given talks about how awful it is and persuaded as

178
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,700
many people as possible to not do free-to-play because it is

179
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,800
universally

180
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,000
Worse for the game, it's worse for the game, it's worth for the people

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,500
playing it.

182
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,400
It's worse for everybody except developers can make a whole bunch of

183
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,900
money or whatever.

184
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,600
So it's always worth, it's always bad for you plays always bad.

185
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,500
I've always hated it.

186
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,300
However, I'm looking at a game that I want to do and I'm pretty

187
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,100
serious about it.

188
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,300
And I think the only way I can get made as if it's free to play, and

189
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
that's not reason enough to do for you to play in my opinion.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,300
If the only way this game could be made is free-to-play, I just

191
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,700
wouldn't do it.

192
00:08:59,700 --> 00:08:59,900
It.

193
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,900
Unless I thought that free-to-play was actually the best model for the

194
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,200
game.

195
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,500
And I believe that I have convinced myself that free-to-play is

196
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
actually what's best for the game.

197
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,500
But I'm concerned that I've convinced myself of something that's not

198
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,700
actually true and I think it would be pretty hypocritical of me to go

199
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,500
ahead and make the game unless I've thoroughly vetted.

200
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,400
My free-to-play is okay.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,700
Point of view in my current situation.

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,300
So I you seem like a person who hates free to play as much as me and

203
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,600
likes arguing, probably not as much as me, but maybe and have my

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,100
previous opinion that free-to-play is just straight-up awful all the

205
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,000
time and there's absolutely no Redemption for it.

206
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,800
So I if I can convince you or at least throw ideas off of you and if I

207
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,200
don't convince you, if you're just like, if you still think it's bad

208
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
but I can like get new ideas about why

209
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,500
Bad or makes my position makes me feel stronger, but my position or

210
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,900
makes or killed my position, whatever I want to test my position.

211
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,900
Against somebody, you know, who could actually perhaps prove me wrong

212
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,000
if that makes any sense, it makes perfect sense.

213
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,200
First of all, I would say, you're never going to make it as a single

214
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,600
executive right now.

215
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,400
That's just the stuff.

216
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,600
You just said, they're your debit.

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
They're going ever going to promote you, man.

218
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
It's not going to happen.

219
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,200
I'll survive.

220
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,400
Okay, fair enough.

221
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,100
So

222
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,900
All right, that all makes good sense.

223
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,400
I I think that's exactly what I have served for the email.

224
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,900
So hopefully everyone at homes on the same page as well.

225
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,200
But before, so before we start I felt like it was important for us to

226
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,400
kind of like set the tone, right?

227
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,500
So that is why I developed this particular treat for you.

228
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,400
Oh boy.

229
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,200
So what I'd like you to do if you could because I mean you have to

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
understand, right?

231
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,800
Like I don't get really paid for this, right?

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
This is outside of handmade Heroes.

233
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,700
Time.

234
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,500
So especially thank you by the way.

235
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
Essentially, this is like this is free, right?

236
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Like it's basically a service for you that I'm providing, which I'm

237
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,200
happy to do, right?

238
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,700
Okay.

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,800
But and you know I said I would do the argument and the argument is

240
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,600
going to be free, but the catch is that the rest of the stuff that

241
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,400
might happen on this stream besides me, arguing with you is not going

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:26,800
to be free.

243
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,300
So if you go ahead and go to handmade here a.org /, donate Tut HTML,

244
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
I'm sorry debate.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,700
Debate dot.

246
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,100
Oh God, you can see that I've created a bunch of add-ons for you.

247
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,500
And those add-ons are ones, you can purchase at any time during the

248
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
debate, and I'll honor them.

249
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,000
But in general, without purchasing any of them, all you get is

250
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,600
actually just just the argument, just in audio form.

251
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,200
So it's up to you again nut, you know, the argument.

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,800
I'll argue

253
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,600
Exactly a strenuously in his hard.

254
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,800
They are going to be exactly the same.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There's no Integrity difference here.

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,400
It's just cosmetic changes.

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,200
I've only put cosmetic changes on there.

258
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,600
All right, so let's continue.

259
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,700
Well, okay, hold on.

260
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,600
I got I do have to, I can't actually purchase any of these items

261
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,200
because I don't own a credit card, but I would love to buy

262
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,300
The EF F hat.

263
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,400
If you have any, if F hat, I would like to buy that you want to buy.

264
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Don't have that hat?

265
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,900
Yeah, but don't have to bother.

266
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,700
I don't have a credit card.

267
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,600
So, yeah.

268
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,300
All right.

269
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,700
Well, that's really difficult for me because I feel like in general,

270
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
if you want it in.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
So in your game, what will you do for people who don't have credit

272
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,100
cards, they just don't have to, they don't have to pay anything.

273
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,200
Okay?

274
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,900
So they would basically they wouldn't get the EF F hat.

275
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,400
They wouldn't get the FFA.

276
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,800
Okay.

277
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,300
So probably

278
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,900
We're going to have to continue the debate without the FF hat, right?

279
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,600
Because I mean at the end of the day if you can't pay for the

280
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,700
free-to-play stuff you can't pay for the free-to-play stuff now I

281
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,600
guess you could try to convince someone else on the stream to pay for

282
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,000
it I mean anyone could buy it and that's okay with me but someone's

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,400
gonna have to pay the two dollars for the EF F hat.

284
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,300
Now of course we don't even have the video add on yet.

285
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,100
So at this point you wouldn't really be able to see the EF F hat.

286
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,500
I guess.

287
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,800
So is the video ad on you have to pay for that too.

288
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,300
There's a lot of stuff there that would have.

289
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,800
To happen, but let's continue the argument, you know, just with that.

290
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,100
With that, in mind, my God, it dollar for you for the video.

291
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,700
I don, I really want to pay for this.

292
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:43,100
So here's the thing, basically, like with free to play, the first

293
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,100
thing I guess I would ask is what you sort of laid out there when you

294
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,400
were talking, sort of suggests to me that their stuff about the game,

295
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,600
but maybe I need to know in order to effectively argue this because

296
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,300
you said something.

297
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,100
Like the most effective thing here, right?

298
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,200
Like the most the best business model for it.

299
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
You said was going to be free to play.

300
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,200
So could you maybe start by telling me?

301
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,000
Why is it that you think that the that that business model is somehow

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
special for your game?

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Or that like, give me a little bit of background there.

304
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,300
So I know why you're coming to that conclusion.

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,300
Sure.

306
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,100
Well, this is going to be unfortunate because you said in the Q&A of

307
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,600
handmade hero that you don't care about Esports at all.

308
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, that's just my me playing them, right?

309
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,000
I know.

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,800
I'm totally fine taking the position.

311
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,600
I understand millions of people love them.

312
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,000
So so let's take it.

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
A given that people will like that.

314
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
So don't worry about that.

315
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,400
Okay?

316
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,100
So yeah, like I want to make

317
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,800
Take DOTA.

318
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay.

319
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Just say don't know.

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's just start there.

321
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
I want to make again this like donor.

322
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:49,600
Right.

323
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:49,900
Okay.

324
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:56,200
So what is required to make it a good competitive esport, right?

325
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,800
There's a couple of things, wait a minute, people have purchased

326
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Video ad on Sean.

327
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,600
This, this dude, I'm telling you, man free to play makes mad money.

328
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,500
And two people have purchased the EF F hat.

329
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,000
If we're to hats now and the ad free credit, the ad, there were going

330
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
to be advertisements.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,500
And they've already Pete, Dunn, 15 minutes worth of ad free on the

332
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:15,800
street.

333
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,200
This is going to be hard for me to even keep track of.

334
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,600
Hold on.

335
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,300
Did you argue against this, though?

336
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,200
The, the money is rolling in.

337
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:26,900
Did your mic?

338
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, all right.

339
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,200
All right.

340
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Hello.

341
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,900
Hi.

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,400
My still there?

343
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,500
I had to put on the hat.

344
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Can you see the f?

345
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,700
F hat.

346
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
People paid good money for this.

347
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,100
I've got the stream delay thing so I don't know what's going on.

348
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,100
Look at that.

349
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,500
Do you have one of those stickers that say, I do not consent to the

350
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,700
search of this device?

351
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,900
I don't uff local.

352
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,500
You should get one.

353
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't.

354
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,000
And I also guess at this point, you know, if people want me to turn on

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the light, there's also the global illumination add-on that they can

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
buy, just want to remind them of that.

357
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,800
So anyway, I just want to say that on my end.

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm offering all of this for free.

359
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,500
This is all the basics is all the basic package.

360
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,400
Wow man, you're not going to last long in this, okay?

361
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
But so continue.

362
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,700
Okay, so basically

363
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Okay, so there's two sort of main factors with trying to make a game

364
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,200
that's competitively viable, that has the depth and the breadth of

365
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,700
DOTA right to.

366
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,300
The first one is obviously a lot of people need to play it, right?

367
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,900
Like the people who you know you can go back and you can look at.

368
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,800
I've been any sport fan for a very very long time and it goes

369
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,100
stretches back to brood War when it was only in Korea and you can look

370
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,700
at brood war in Korea and how the strategies developed over time.

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,700
They blizzard didn't do patches.

372
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,500
For six years, I think.

373
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,700
And none of the none of the units that blizzard had designed were used

374
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,100
in the way in which they had designed that.

375
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,600
Right.

376
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,100
What happened is the game was played by, you know, hundreds of

377
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,600
thousands millions of people in Korea primarily and strategies

378
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,700
developed and things like that.

379
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,599
So the only way that the game actually got competitively viable and

380
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,300
competitively deep which through a lot of people playing it, okay?

381
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,700
So you need a lot of people play it, right?

382
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
So therefore the more people playing it,

383
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
It the better the game is going to get because you have more data to

384
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
analyze and you can balance things better, right?

385
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,300
Okay.

386
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,900
So free to play gets a lot of people playing it, okay?

387
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,500
So that's one thing.

388
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,700
The second thing is, in order to now this goes against brood War, but

389
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I think times are different now.

390
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:32,500
In order to sort of foster an online community, and remain

391
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,500
competitive, and host tournaments, and and get people together to have

392
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,200
stats to have a hosted dedicated server, you know, all that fun stuff

393
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
that Everyone likes,

394
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,900
Matchmaking and all that crap.

395
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
You have ongoing expenses, right?

396
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,600
You have you don't you don't have your expenses up front at time of

397
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,500
purchase of the game.

398
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,300
If your expenses carried on for indefinitely, right?

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,500
The free-to-play model lines up, your Revenue with your expenses,

400
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,500
better than anything else, subscription does it too.

401
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,800
But subscription doesn't work for the first problem, which is getting

402
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,100
a lot of people play it, right?

403
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
So you have to the two problems.

404
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,700
Are you need money constantly?

405
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Because the game is expensive constantly and you need a lot of people

406
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,600
playing it and ad-supported, you know, maybe that's an option but like

407
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,900
realistically and I wouldn't ever do ad supported but

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
But free-to-play seems to be the thing that fits both of those two

409
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
requirements better than anything else.

410
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:44,100
And I think it's downsides can be mitigated against, but can be

411
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,100
lessened by by a benevolent dictator, basically.

412
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:55,200
So, just to be clear when you say that subscription model doesn't get

413
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,800
a lot of people playing the game, what you're talking about sustained.

414
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Because I mean I'm assuming like

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,300
Most games nowadays that I think of, for subscription model, their

416
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,900
Games like World of Warcraft or something like this, in the earlier

417
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
before they went, I think they're somewhat half-free now or something

418
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,000
like that.

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,500
But in the early days, you know, you would get a month free or

420
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
something like that.

421
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
So, you did start out, you know, you could have arbitrarily many

422
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,600
people playing for a month, right?

423
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,900
But then presumably after that, they would win 0 away or something

424
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,700
like this, right?

425
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,100
Yeah.

426
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,500
And I don't even know like because there's not a lot of

427
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,500
Turn based games that are coming out now.

428
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,400
So I have absolutely no idea if that's even viable at all now, right?

429
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,300
Like there's no data in the last couple of years of subscription-based

430
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,500
games coming out and doing okay, everything's been moving to free to

431
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:45,900
play.

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay.

433
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,100
So I guess let's take a look at that.

434
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,500
That specific aspect, then because like you said, you were somebody

435
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,100
who previously, didn't agree with free to play as a model, right?

436
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,800
I still think that every free.

437
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Play as is is awful and unacceptably, an unacceptable.

438
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,400
I don't think anyone is doing it, there are, you know, there are

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,500
there's a gradient of people doing it really, really poorly and people

440
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,800
doing it slightly less evilly, but I don't think anyone doing it now

441
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,600
is doing it like to meet my what I would call my minimal ethical

442
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,000
standards for, but that doesn't mean that that doesn't exist.

443
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,800
Okay?

444
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,300
So I guess maybe before I go any further on that topic then and also I

445
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,800
should say that people have purchased

446
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,400
All of the Hat add-ons for me now, so I kind of feel like I should

447
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,300
probably switch hats.

448
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:35,900
Periodically.

449
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,600
So don't be alarmed when I do that before them all at once.

450
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah.

451
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,100
Well I feel like people want to see individual hats, so someone

452
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
purchased the pig hat and also the luxurious Deluxe top hat so that

453
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,600
will be coming out later as well.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,300
Okay, so I guess if we're going to talk about that one part, then

455
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,300
again, that's information that I don't quite have yet which is what is

456
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,700
it that you are saying is, is

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,300
This ethical like, what are you going to be doing that?

458
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,500
You feel makes this more ethical than say what valve is doing with

459
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,000
Dota or something like this.

460
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,500
Okay.

461
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,800
So valve is probably the closest, okay?

462
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,500
So they're there you would call them as far down on the ethics like as

463
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,700
far down as far up on the ethical.

464
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,000
However you want to call it as close to good on the ethical scale as

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,300
as exists at the moment that I'm aware of.

466
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,200
But you are aware of.

467
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,900
Yes, I was and I actually have done quite a bit of research into this.

468
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,100
Okay.

469
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,300
What valve does wrong is they spend all of their development Budget

470
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,800
on.

471
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Cosmetics.

472
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,300
The, I don't know.

473
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,300
I think there's 27 people working on DOTA last.

474
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,200
I heard and I don't know how those people's time are allocated but

475
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,400
based on what they won't have, I'm sorry, it's really distracting

476
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,000
seeing you with the pig hat on with stream delay.

477
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,100
So I have to minimize that.

478
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,600
Sorry.

479
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,500
So what valve valve, I think they've 27 people were going to do this.

480
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,700
Last I heard I don't know if that's true or not anymore but the

481
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,800
majority of their money seems to go into

482
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,600
Cosmetics.

483
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:08,200
Right, producing Cosmetics, based on what they actually release most

484
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
of their work seems to be cosmetics.

485
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,900
And another interesting thing is player content tools.

486
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,900
So there, you know, you can go make a cosmetic for DOTA and then sell

487
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,200
it on the valve store right there on Steam, Workshop stuff and all

488
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,100
that, right, right?

489
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,800
But they have like, they release like their 3D editing, like their

490
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
animation editing tools, they release their part,

491
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,000
Call system tools their whole pipeline for importing and creating

492
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,200
Cosmetics.

493
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,500
They've released all of that, right?

494
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
And they put a lot of effort into it because they're not like I've

495
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,300
tried them, they're not like developer tools, like they're actually.

496
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,300
Their you eyes are actions which are focused.

497
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah, exactly.

498
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,400
So they put they seem to be putting effort into that and cosmetic

499
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:50,700
items.

500
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,900
They're putting very little effort into

501
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,300
Very little resources relative to the rest of the development budget

502
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,500
or relative to their income is more like it.

503
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Right to actually improving the game for everybody.

504
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,400
And that's where I think valves, that's where I have an issue with

505
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,100
valves ethics.

506
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,800
I mean, clearly they're doing like they're not bad because all their

507
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
stuff is free.

508
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,500
Like you can play the entirety of the game for free.

509
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,400
It's only Cosmetics, blah blah blah, all that's good but their

510
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,200
development resources.

511
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't think our, I don't think they're putting in

512
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,500
Human Resources into making the game better, like there's still two

513
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
heroes from DOTA 1.

514
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,400
That have not been ported to Dota 2 for like three or four like six

515
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,300
years now or TI 55 years.

516
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
Now how is that possible?

517
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,700
Like, it's not that hard and they're making I don't know how much

518
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,200
built literally, billions of dollars off of it.

519
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,700
Like they should have been able to devote more resources to the game

520
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,000
and they're not and that's where I have an issue with what valves

521
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,500
doing but I think, otherwise, I'm okay with what I was doing.

522
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,500
so yeah, that would be my sort of ethical thing is basically what

523
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,800
valves

524
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,300
Aang, I don't know about the workshop in the user tools.

525
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm not, I don't know how I feel about that and then actually, taking

526
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,600
the money that we make are free to play, and putting it all into the

527
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,400
game, not like 10% of it, and then going, and driving Ferraris off

528
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
cliffs or whatever they do with their money.

529
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I'm pretty sure that driving for ours off.

530
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,300
Cliffs is a pretty big line item, but it probably doesn't account for

531
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:21,900
all of it.

532
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Well, I don't know.

533
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,200
So, I guess the, the thing that I would point out which I mean,

534
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,800
hopefully, like, this is kind of obvious.

535
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,500
Right.

536
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,600
That what you just described is kind of what the primary fear is with

537
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,400
the whole concept of free to play, which is that, the product isn't

538
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,900
the game, the product is the part that you sell, that's what your

539
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,800
action making money off.

540
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,400
So isn't it kind of just a very natural consequence of trying to run a

541
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,000
business?

542
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,300
Whose product is the Cosmetics that most of the money would be spent

543
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,300
on the Cosmetics?

544
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,200
Like, isn't that kind of a consequence?

545
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,500
Of if a business adopts, this business model.

546
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,200
Well that's the case if it's like a publicly held Corporation because

547
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,400
they have to make the have to maximize profit, right?

548
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,500
But that's not the case revolved are not public and even if they said

549
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,600
the majority of their development, budget was spent on Cosmetics.

550
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,400
That's fine.

551
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,600
You can do that if they're spending an adequate amount on everything

552
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
else which they're not which is the problem, right?

553
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,200
So like if they're making I don't know how much what do they make.

554
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,500
Like a billion dollars off.

555
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,800
Do do last year Revenue.

556
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I don't know what their expenses are but it can't be their server

557
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,100
expenses.

558
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,000
Can't be that high, right?

559
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
So they don't really have that high of a per user cost but they're

560
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,500
making I think to 70 per user per month or something like that.

561
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,100
If they were to take, you know, their let's say, they make half the

562
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,600
say, 250 million dollars profit, right somehow.

563
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,300
There aren't there.

564
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,800
They have 750 million dollars of server expenses.

565
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
I don't know how but that's what their that's what their server

566
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,500
expenses are.

567
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,300
If they're making only 250 billion dollars of profit off of the game,

568
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,400
they're not putting anywhere near that back into the game, right?

569
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
So when you're putting, you know, with 27 people, right?

570
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Riot has 1000 right valve?

571
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
Could easily grow the DOTA team.

572
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,400
I know valves motto is we never hire people or whatever, and we hate

573
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,800
hiring, which is fine.

574
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,600
But when you take in that much money you have, I believe you have a

575
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,900
responsibility to put majority of it back into the game.

576
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,700
And if you want to spend, you know, if they're making six hundred

577
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,900
million dollars or whatever it is, and they

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,800
I put 200 million dollars back into the development over the course of

579
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,200
a year.

580
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,300
If they put 100 million of that into Cosmetics that's fine because

581
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,100
they're still putting 100 million into development which they're not.

582
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,900
I don't know how many people like I said, I don't have anymore

583
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,500
actually working on live development but

584
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,900
I feel like two people could be doing as much as they're as they're

585
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,400
getting done.

586
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,200
Not that's outside of their like content creation tools and things

587
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,500
like that.

588
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,100
But just actual content that's added to the game.

589
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,700
It's like two or three people's of work, two or three people's worth

590
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,200
of work.

591
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,800
So that's my problem with it is that they there

592
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,600
Enough into the into the actual development of the game.

593
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,500
They could like I said that they could put a lot into Cosmetics.

594
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,300
I don't think that's a problem.

595
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,100
As long as they put more back into it, but like you said, it's if

596
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,300
you're trying to run it as a business, if you're trying to run it as a

597
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,700
business to maximize profit, then know it can never ever be ethical

598
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,900
but you don't have to run a business to maximize profit.

599
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Well, so I guess the next question that I would ask then is what is

600
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,400
that balance?

601
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:29,800
So

602
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,800
Normally in, you know, a traditional Marketplace.

603
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,300
If the question is, okay?

604
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,300
I am trying to provide this thing, whatever it is.

605
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,600
And in this case, it's a game.

606
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,400
Normally, what we do is we say, well, you know, I want to know how

607
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,400
much money I should put towards the development of the game.

608
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,700
So I set a price for the game, like a subscription fee, or whatever it

609
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,000
is.

610
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,300
And then, I know everyone who pays a subscription fee is trying to pay

611
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
me to develop more of this game.

612
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
That's really obvious like what that means.

613
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But in the model that you're sort of advocating, it's sort of a like

614
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,700
developer honor System.

615
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,600
I guess you might call it.

616
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,600
You're basically saying, well, we're going to have the product not be

617
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,100
that thing.

618
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,500
Meaning, nobody pays for the development, the game development, the

619
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,400
game is just supposed to happen, right?

620
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,900
What you pay for is a bunch of cosmetic items, but we don't expect you

621
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,800
to spend all your time developing the Cosmetic items.

622
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,500
We expect you to in order to be an ethical developer to set some

623
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,600
percentage.

624
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,400
Of that diversion.

625
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
So how is that?

626
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,600
How are you seeing that as a model who set that percentage?

627
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,000
Do you set that percentage?

628
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,300
As the developer.

629
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,900
Are you making that percentage up?

630
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,900
Like how is that economic system working?

631
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,900
Well, it doesn't work because I don't think anyone does this in your

632
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,800
game that right?

633
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
Well, the kidding it's going to work.

634
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Well, I mean it,

635
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,400
If a certain amount of money gets made that, yes, of course it will

636
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,100
work because there's enough money to throw at the problem.

637
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,200
And then, the problem goes away.

638
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,500
But will know, even that I'm not even talking about, the problem goes

639
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:03,700
away.

640
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm like, saying, we have a decision.

641
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,400
We could hire another artist to make cosmetic items, or we can hire

642
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,300
another programmer to work on gameplay code or something, right?

643
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:11,800
Right.

644
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,200
Which one of those two people do?

645
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,800
We hire?

646
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,400
How is that decision getting made?

647
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,700
Yeah, like that's, you know, that's actually the root of the problem,

648
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,100
right?

649
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
I don't know how.

650
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,000
Actually, make that decision.

651
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,500
I think you'd have to make that decision.

652
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I think you'd be able to so much transparent about it and just be

653
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,800
like, look, this is how much, you know, if we're open about it, we

654
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,200
say, look, this is how much money we're spending on development of the

655
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,500
game?

656
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,200
This is how much money we're spending on development of Cosmetics at

657
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
this, is how much money we're making.

658
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I don't think we would talk about that, but maybe we could be public

659
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,300
with.

660
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,700
Here's the percentage that goes into development of cosmetics.

661
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,900
And here's the percentage that goes into development of the game, and

662
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,400
if we're transparent about that, does that alleviate that concern?

663
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,400
Well, I guess, I don't know if it'll

664
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,000
Alleviates the concern or not.

665
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,400
It's simply a more something to think about in terms of, if you

666
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,800
believe

667
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
You've that you know, this sort of a model was something that you're

668
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,800
saying is okay in general to adopt because presumably you're not I

669
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
mean maybe you are making the sergeant about no but presumably you're

670
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,100
not making the argument that you are.

671
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,700
The one company that has ever allowed to ethically adopt this model.

672
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,100
Presumably I sort of em.

673
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Okay.

674
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Okay, so so what you're saying is that if I wanted to make a game

675
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,600
using, you're allowed to all your eye, okay?

676
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,700
So there are two people.

677
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,800
There are two people allowed to do it.

678
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,500
Basically okay in all seriousness it you really saying that?

679
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,100
No well no but I there are very few people whom I would even trust

680
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
with what I'm asking.

681
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,700
People to trust me with if that makes any sense and I didn't and the

682
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,100
trust thing is an issue and I do hope that it can like we can't come

683
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
up with a way to

684
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,600
Be transparent enough that the trust isn't isn't there as an issue.

685
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,000
But yeah no I do think that it puts too much power into the developer

686
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,600
to make arbitrary decisions about where to spend people's money to

687
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,900
make the game better, right?

688
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,100
Like if the decision is entirely up to the developer and it's in a

689
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,100
black box and closed room and no one knows about it, right?

690
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,000
Like, that's a problem period, no matter who's in charge.

691
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,800
And I don't know how you sort of solve that other than with trusting

692
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,700
the developer.

693
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,000
Like you, like you were asking, is am I advocating that I'm the only

694
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,500
one who can do it?

695
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
I don't know who else I would trust with it to be completely honest.

696
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,700
So perhaps in like some weird way, I am saying that but yeah, I don't

697
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:34,900
know.

698
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,700
I don't know what to do about this other than hope that transparency

699
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,600
sort of salt it.

700
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,900
Well I think that there's a real problem there, right?

701
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,300
Because I mean essentially what you're saying if that is is what it

702
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,900
all boils down.

703
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,300
To essentially what you're saying is this is not a good idea, but

704
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,700
don't worry because I'm a

705
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Good person.

706
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,200
So the fact that it's not a good idea is not going to affect me,

707
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,700
meaning?

708
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,900
No, I'm not saying that sentence that are there that are to drive

709
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,900
development in different directions than they should be driven.

710
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm not going to fall prey to them because I'm me.

711
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,300
Uh-huh.

712
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,500
Well, I know I'd be like, that's like the funny way of phrasing it but

713
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,400
like no matter what you do, there's downsides right?

714
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,100
Like no matter what business model, you choose to run, there are

715
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,700
positives and negatives to it, right?

716
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,400
Let's say we this game cost 3 million dollars to make.

717
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,900
And let's say I have 3 million dollars and I spent three million

718
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,400
dollars and I make this game, right?

719
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,300
And I charge $40 for it, and it doesn't make that money, right, I'm

720
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:33,700
screwed.

721
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,400
Right, and that's not good for the game and the game will be a failure

722
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
and no one will play it in blah blah blah, right?

723
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,600
No matter what you do.

724
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,600
There's positives and negatives to your your business model choice,

725
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,800
right?

726
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,800
Doesn't matter what it is in this situation, the - of who controls

727
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,700
development resources and all and the question you brought

728
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,000
Yep.

729
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,400
I think, is far, far, far less of a negative than

730
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Not having enough people to gather enough data to make intelligent

731
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,500
balance decisions or not.

732
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,700
Be able to run the community that we need to run and not be able to

733
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,000
run the matchmaking servers and and the game servers and all that fun

734
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,200
stuff that we need to run in order to make the game competitively

735
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,800
viable.

736
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,600
Not being able to run, those is much more of a negative than the

737
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,800
development resource.

738
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:27,900
Issue.

739
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,000
And in my opinion, do you disagree with that?

740
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Yes, I mean I don't know that I disagree with with the specifics of

741
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
that analysis.

742
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,100
What I disagree with is the framing of it.

743
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,200
So what it suggests is that there's a pros and cons column of

744
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,500
different funding models.

745
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,500
And that what we're talking about is what are the pros of one and what

746
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
are the cons of the other?

747
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,900
But I don't think that's really a very fair way to

748
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,500
Look at what these business models actually mean.

749
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,100
Because actually what's more important about the business models is

750
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,200
not pros and cons but rather where the incentives are, right?

751
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,300
Meaning, it's sort of more, it's less like saying, you know what?

752
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:18,000
What, you know there's a risk here and there's a benefit there, it's

753
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
more saying okay, normally if you sell a game, your incentive is to

754
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,300
make the game good as a whole, right?

755
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:26,000
Okay?

756
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,900
There's no other

757
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Other incentives there, right?

758
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,400
The only incentive is to convince people that this is a good game and

759
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,300
that they should buy it.

760
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,100
There are no, there's no smaller D.

761
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,600
You know, there's no more fine-grained incentive than that, that's

762
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,000
your goal.

763
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,900
The game is the product.

764
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,199
If you make it good, then it is a good product that people might want,

765
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:44,400
right?

766
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,600
If you don't, it isn't, there is it?

767
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
That's and that's very straightforward.

768
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,600
Right?

769
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,300
In the case that you're sort of advocating with the free-to-play, then

770
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,900
it's about what the incentives are for the developer.

771
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,800
You are not in

772
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,500
Devised as a developer economically, speaking, to make the game better

773
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,800
your incentivised to make a game where people will purchase add-ons,

774
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,600
that's what your incentivize to do.

775
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Just straight up because you could make the best game that anyone's

776
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,700
ever had.

777
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,600
But if it doesn't run in a way that encourages add-ons, you will never

778
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,400
make the money you need to do any of the things you're talking about.

779
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,500
So it's less about what the pros and cons are and more about what you

780
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,800
as a developer must think about day to day in order.

781
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Her to survive.

782
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,300
The first thing in your head has to be.

783
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,800
How do I monetize this game?

784
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,300
Rather than how do I make this game?

785
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,900
Great, how do I make this game?

786
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:43,600
Great is only a tangential step to the process of getting someone to

787
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,700
click on the, I want to buy a hat.

788
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Does that make sense?

789
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:47,900
If that makes sense.

790
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,800
There's two things here.

791
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,400
And where's this, while you're answering that, I'm going to switch

792
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,500
hats from the pig to the Top Hat because someone thought that as well.

793
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,500
All right, then.

794
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,200
I want to know how much money you make off this, by the way.

795
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,700
Going to do something with it at handmade con all of the money that

796
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,400
comes from a doll, like I was, I was wanted to force you to have to

797
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,200
buy these things.

798
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,500
So the stream has I shouldn't have announced the URL that was my

799
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,400
mistake but okay I would have bought them.

800
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,000
Sorry.

801
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,200
All right that's how like anti everything I am.

802
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,300
I don't even have a credit card.

803
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,900
That's a problem or a cell phone.

804
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,300
Okay.

805
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,800
Press.

806
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,700
So anyways, okay so there's there's yes.

807
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,000
What you just said is completely true, it, right?

808
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,800
The first the first,

809
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
Why do you think we're looking at granny?

810
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,500
Because we have to do attachment points and skinning around attachment

811
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,400
points and things like that.

812
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,300
And that's just going to be like the hats on, man.

813
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,200
That's a, that's like a master program, right?

814
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,300
Like that's going to be like, you know, two months of work or

815
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,700
something, right?

816
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,100
Just to get all that right and get like a pipeline for exporting and

817
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,100
then attachment points and skinning meshes on attached.

818
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,500
Fuck that shit shit.

819
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,000
Sorry, I can't swear, that's that I didn't want to that's why we're

820
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,900
looking at granting, right?

821
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,700
Because because of free-to-play, right?

822
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,200
So

823
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,100
Yes, you're absolutely right.

824
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,600
That's something that we have to consider at all times.

825
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,200
If I may interject, this one pro tip and I learned this from many

826
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,500
years of working on that product try to watch your phrasing because

827
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,800
you end up saying things like, that's why we're looking at granny and

828
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,900
it just sounds bad out of context.

829
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,500
I've done a lot of things like, oh, man.

830
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,600
I've been doing granny 25 years or all these, like, you just want to

831
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,800
make sure that you just kind of say, like, you know, it was a mistake.

832
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
I admit that we should have named the product, something that doesn't

833
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,000
have those accidents in it.

834
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
Anyway, continue, did you choose the name?

835
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
We chose the name together I guess.

836
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,100
All right.

837
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,500
Well I like it.

838
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:32,800
Okay.

839
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,600
So the other issue I think is kind of naive from your point of view,

840
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,000
right?

841
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,300
Like it's not true that when you make a game that all you care about

842
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,400
is making a really good game to sell it like this just flat-out.

843
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,900
Just demonstratively.

844
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,100
Not true, right?

845
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,000
Like look at development.

846
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Budgets versus marketing budgets of games, right?

847
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,300
Marketing budget of Halo is more than the development.

848
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,600
You my marketing budget of Madden or whatever is more in the

849
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,800
Development budget, right?

850
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So that's not true.

851
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,200
And what's not true.

852
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,300
That the only thing you're concerned about with the create a product

853
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,500
and sell it model is that all you consider all you're concerned about

854
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,200
is quality, you're not going to do anything else, but no, but I'm

855
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,600
talking about the developer, the marketing budgets, the same in any

856
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,800
case, like you're going to have this.

857
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,800
All those same things are true about marketing on your end, meaning

858
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,400
right after market the game.

859
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,600
So, we're talking about the person developing the actual game, right?

860
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
But the, the freedom

861
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,400
Part of it could just be considered you know I'm a marketing thing,

862
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,600
right?

863
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,200
Like it could be like we're this is we're making the game,

864
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,400
irrespective irrespective, we're making the game completely in

865
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,500
isolation of the free-to-play and marketing stuff and the free-to-play

866
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,300
marketing stuff is done on its own with a separate budget and that's

867
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,600
like a marketing side, right?

868
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,500
That's different from the actual game.

869
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,600
Now, there's crossover of course, but if I know that again, I would

870
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,300
also disagree with that categorization, right?

871
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,600
Because they are fundamentally different in

872
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,900
In case you were talking about trying.

873
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,700
Raise the awareness of or convince people that they want to purchase

874
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,400
this game that you have made, right?

875
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,700
Yes.

876
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,700
In the other case you actually have to have the game itself.

877
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,300
Be something that has these things in it and that encourages you to

878
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,800
purchase them because otherwise you won't right.

879
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,100
No.

880
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,700
Yeah, okay.

881
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
But they're fundamentally different things.

882
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,000
One is about marketing.

883
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,300
A thing that you made the other is making a thing that has this

884
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,800
separate commercial product.

885
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Inside of it.

886
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,700
And they're not, I don't think you can analogize them in a

887
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,500
straightforward fashion as you did, okay?

888
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,100
That's fair.

889
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,600
That's true.

890
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,900
On the flip side though, even the products themselves are different,

891
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,000
right?

892
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,200
Because this isn't like a product that you could put in a box and ship

893
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,500
and then the, then me as the developer would walk away from right,

894
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,700
like with diet or whatever, right?

895
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,600
I shift the game, and I'm done, right?

896
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,300
Save a bug patch, which I never actually had to do one for diet was

897
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,000
bug-free.

898
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,400
So,

899
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,100
I was just done, right?

900
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,900
So I shouldn't be getting any more money for that and I shouldn't be

901
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,400
worrying about it because I'm done with this game.

902
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
It's not done right when it comes out, even if it came out after three

903
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,400
million dollars or whatever amount of development budget to get like I

904
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,700
finished product out the game still not done ever.

905
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,300
It's potentially never done, right?

906
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,200
Because there's always if I'm always balances, there's always new

907
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,300
things to add, there's always new game modes, there's tons of crap,

908
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,600
like I have a, I've been thinking about this game for 6 years, right?

909
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,500
I have like, binders, full of notes about things that I want to try.

910
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,200
And this is an ongoing thing.

911
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:42,700
So having a payment model that matches the ongoingness of the design

912
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,900
and development of the game.

913
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,800
I don't think I think that actually is more ethical because now, I'm

914
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,500
encouraged to or incentivized house doesn't match the model the game,

915
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,900
because the things that people are paying for, aren't in the binders.

916
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,400
Okay, but if it incentivizes, no, I'm not.

917
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,100
Implementing the binders because they can't buy the stuff that's in

918
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,900
the binders, that's in the binders is the game that you guys do for

919
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,400
free.

920
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,500
Well it's not well yes that's that is a that is a very black and white

921
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
I think way of looking at it right?

922
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:24,300
You say all you're doing is developing all you care about is are all

923
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,900
that matters for making money is the Cosmetics, right?

924
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,800
And that's just not true.

925
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,300
Like if the game isn't good.

926
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,000
Although

927
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:36,000
This statement I can say there's evidence that it's not true.

928
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,600
But in the except for the case of League of Legends games that the

929
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,300
game has to be good, it has to continuously improve it has to get

930
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,600
better.

931
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
It has to actually be a good game.

932
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,100
Money needs to be spent on the development of the game.

933
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:53,400
Otherwise, people notice that you're only doing cosmetics and people

934
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,300
lose interest, right?

935
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,100
And it's not and these are old, like, literally only Cosmetics.

936
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,200
There's no play to win or anything like that.

937
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,900
So there's no

938
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,100
Sensitive to we can't make the game not better.

939
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,900
We have to continuously make the game better.

940
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,800
So that's I don't think that I don't think that separating them in

941
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,700
such a black-and-white way.

942
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,300
Is fair.

943
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,200
I think it's actually I wouldn't even call it just fair.

944
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,600
I would almost say that what you just said is exactly the point that

945
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
I'm trying to make the way you described.

946
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,100
It was perfect was exactly encapsulated what I feel is so detrimental

947
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,700
about the business model, right?

948
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,600
The way you talked about it is like we can't we have to make the game

949
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:29,800
good.

950
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
So far no one will play it.

951
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,100
Dot dot dot so we won't so no one will buy the hats right?

952
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,700
And it's like that is exactly the correct the correct statement for

953
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,500
the position, the developers in the game and making it good enough.

954
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,300
The only requirement is as good enough that people will play it, so

955
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,200
they'll buy the hats.

956
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,900
There is no not right.

957
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,600
That's well, I only said it for demonstrating your point.

958
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,000
Here, that is true.

959
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,600
That is the minimum goodness, that the game has to be right.

960
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,900
But like, yeah, that's the problem.

961
00:42:59,700 --> 00:42:59,900
Okay.

962
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,700
But there's a minimum goodness that the next Assassin's Creed game has

963
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,000
to be, has to be to write, like there's a minimum goodness at the next

964
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Call of Duty game has to be too, right?

965
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,300
And whatever the companies that make those are will push to that

966
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,700
minimum and that's it.

967
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,300
How is that any different?

968
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,400
Well, that I don't think that's actually true at those games, right?

969
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,100
If they make a much better game or at least the theory is, if you make

970
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,000
a much better game, especially as an independent developer, you know,

971
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,200
with when you're talking about Triple, AAA with extra as, on the end

972
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,400
of it or whatever, then again, kind of who

973
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,800
Always because maybe it's goes into the realm of like pop culture and

974
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,200
marketing and at that point or whatever.

975
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,600
But for an indie Studio.

976
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,200
At least if you make a much better game, presumably a lot more people

977
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,000
are talking about it.

978
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,100
A lot more people are playing at that sort of thing.

979
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,800
It's the kind of a thing where the game itself is in general.

980
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,600
The better.

981
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,200
It is the more of a product.

982
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,200
It becomes, whereas instead, if you just talked about a situation

983
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,300
where it's like, well we make money on this separate part of the

984
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,100
A game that isn't the game because nobody paid for the game.

985
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,400
Then really, we have a different curve that we're shooting for, it

986
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,100
doesn't even necessarily matter how many people play the game, what

987
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,700
matters is.

988
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,800
If the people who spend a lot of money on add-ons, play the game, we

989
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,400
don't even care.

990
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
If good players play this game, it could all be bad players that play

991
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,000
this game.

992
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,700
We don't even care if it's balanced because balance won't necessarily

993
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,900
affect it, right?

994
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,000
We don't even know and it doesn't matter all of those things.

995
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,400
They are only relevant to our survival in so far as they

996
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,800
Might prevent people from participating in the secondary economy,

997
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,200
whereas none of those things would generally be true for a different

998
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,600
type of game for different type of game, you know, it's just the

999
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,400
product you don't, you're not, there's no way Little Miss to it.

1000
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,800
There's no concept that certain players are more valuable for us to

1001
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,500
have that others.

1002
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,700
None of, that is true, right?

1003
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,300
So I don't see, I don't see how you're getting there.

1004
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,100
I don't see her getting there with that.

1005
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,700
Well, okay, so all of what you just said describes Riot to a tee.

1006
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:57,900
Right.

1007
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,400
That's, that's right.

1008
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,900
Right there.

1009
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,400
Right?

1010
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,100
All they care about is getting their maximum like they don't care

1011
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,500
about the competitiveness of it like there's just years of

1012
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,600
demonstrating that they don't care about the quality of the game.

1013
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,700
They only care about catering to their most valuable players or

1014
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,300
whatever, right?

1015
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,400
And and yes, that's, you know, that happens.

1016
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,100
That's why free-to-play sucks, right?

1017
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
But that doesn't need to happen, it doesn't have to be that way,

1018
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,100
right?

1019
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,800
Like that's just because it's easy to make money.

1020
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,800
When you do that, that's what people do but that doesn't, it doesn't

1021
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,900
have to be that way, right?

1022
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,900
Like valve does a pretty reasonable job of not doing that.

1023
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,100
They do some stuff with, you know, rewards at the end of the game and

1024
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,900
randomized boxes and all that fun stuff that they do that stuff is

1025
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:51,600
questionable.

1026
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,700
But for the most part the way in which they

1027
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,500
The way in which they balance the game, at least, the way in which the

1028
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,600
game design ideas are applied to slowly in my opinion.

1029
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,500
But the way in, which the game ideas, are applied, like ice frogs

1030
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,100
balances and you know, whenever they remodel a hero, they do a really

1031
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,800
good job with it.

1032
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,600
Like everything is the voice acting is incredible and that's all free

1033
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,300
or whatever.

1034
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,200
They're putting the money into actually making the game better.

1035
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,700
And I think that if you look at relative player, rates relative

1036
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,500
player, base increases or decreases and you look at DOTA vs League of

1037
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,900
Legends.

1038
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,400
The graphs are like in the complete opposite direction, right?

1039
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,600
DOTA is gaining players at the relative rate that league is losing

1040
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,100
players.

1041
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,400
So I think that

1042
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,000
The the quality of the game is what is actually does matter.

1043
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,700
You're saying it has absolutely no bearing on anything.

1044
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,000
The only thing that matters is the quality of the things that you sell

1045
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,300
or the way in which you construct, your Skinner box to get people to

1046
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,200
buy things, right?

1047
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,400
And I don't think that's true.

1048
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
It doesn't have to be true.

1049
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,200
It might be true in most examples, but I don't think it has to be

1050
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,500
true.

1051
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,400
I think you can make the game and continue to make it better with the

1052
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,200
money that you're making off.

1053
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,400
The free-to-play, things spend a good chunk of your money on.

1054
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,200
Actually improving the game versus spending it on hats.

1055
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,800
I don't see why you can't do that.

1056
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,500
Well, it's not really that you can't do something, right?

1057
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,500
Because most things that are a bad idea or most things that are

1058
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,800
generally unethical.

1059
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Like if you're talking about a process, a virtuous, and divine being

1060
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,000
who comes down and wants to do them in a way that isn't evil could

1061
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,400
write like, you know, you can be

1062
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Be a stockbroker who isn't evil.

1063
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,300
It's just the system is not set up to reward that.

1064
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,300
So as a result, that is not who stays in business, right?

1065
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,600
The people who participate in business models, which are inherently

1066
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,800
rewarding of devious Behavior, or manipulative Behavior.

1067
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,300
The people who tend to survive are the ones who engage in that

1068
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,900
behavior, right?

1069
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,800
That's just that's just the nature of incentives.

1070
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:11,500
They are creating a feedback function, which makes it more likely that

1071
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,000
bad behavior is reinforced, right?

1072
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,400
That's it.

1073
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
That's, that's true.

1074
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,400
That is certainly true.

1075
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,700
So that again, that's why I think it gets back to what we started this

1076
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,600
with which is it sounds like what you're saying is, yes, the business

1077
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,900
model has all of the problems that we're talking about, but the reason

1078
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,800
you don't have to worry about it is because I Sean McGrath

1079
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,200
I am a good enough person, that that's not going to happen to me,

1080
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,100
right?

1081
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,300
Okay.

1082
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,000
So there's there's, there's two things here.

1083
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,400
We talk about incentives.

1084
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,400
I want to get back to incentives in a second, but the Mishima graph of

1085
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,300
being benevolent dictator or whatever.

1086
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,200
Now, I would like Plato.

1087
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,700
It's a Play-Doh sort of, you know, the classic Plato thing dictators

1088
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,100
are great.

1089
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,400
If you have the exact right one?

1090
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,500
Yes exactly.

1091
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,500
So I'm willing to hear any ideas.

1092
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:07,100
Minimize my power in this relationship that I would be bringing on

1093
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,000
with people who might buy a hat and my game, right?

1094
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,400
I'm I want to not be a benevolent dictator.

1095
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,700
I would much rather be in a situation where

1096
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm like, legally enforced or legally required or something to not be

1097
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,200
a dick.

1098
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,300
Like if if there's a law that that like requires it, I would feel

1099
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,500
totally comfortable with that and I don't actually have an answer to

1100
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:34,700
that.

1101
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,300
I don't know what I can do to like alleviate that concern.

1102
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,400
But what I, what I am getting at though, is that in this situation

1103
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,700
because of my goals for the game which are to make it a highly

1104
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,300
competitive,

1105
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,100
High quality, you know, do level quality, much more competitively

1106
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,100
viable than even DOTA game free to play.

1107
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,400
Fits that better than anything else.

1108
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,700
And yes, it has downsides.

1109
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,800
And yes, those downsides can potentially be crazy evil.

1110
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,500
But you know, what can you do?

1111
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,200
But you were talking about, by the way and what can you do?

1112
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,700
Isn't rhetorical what can you do?

1113
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,900
If you can give me ideas and suggestions or anybody has any ideas or

1114
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,800
suggestions to what I can do to sort of shift the balance of power

1115
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,000
away?

1116
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,800
From, you know, a benevolent dictator two people.

1117
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,400
I would love to hear it because I'm certainly would like to do that,

1118
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:25,600
right?

1119
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,900
Like, I don't this isn't a scam to make a whole bunch of money.

1120
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
This is like, I literally think free-to-play is the best possible

1121
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,700
option for this game because you were talking about incentives before,

1122
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:33,900
right?

1123
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,900
And I was saying that the development cost is an ongoing thing, right?

1124
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,300
I'm incentivised to continue to work on the game and continue to make

1125
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:41,700
it better.

1126
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,600
Now, whether or not you think that the incentive

1127
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,700
Is more towards making hats or more towards making a better game.

1128
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,700
It can't be argued that there is at least something to making a better

1129
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:51,900
game.

1130
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,300
Where after a game that's been released, that's been sold with the

1131
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,100
sticker price.

1132
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,000
There's no more incentive to work on the game ever, right?

1133
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,800
We can shut the server's down next week, you know release.

1134
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,100
Game shut the server's down, right?

1135
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,500
That would actually be the most economically viable thing to do.

1136
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,600
That's what I would be incentivized to do, right?

1137
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,400
Make the game sell as much as possible.

1138
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,900
Shut the server's down as soon as possible.

1139
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,500
That's how that would be the best way to make money off of a game

1140
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,300
where you just buy it at the start.

1141
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:18,300
So, well, not really if you assume that people buy it over time but

1142
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,500
either way, like shut it down as soon as possible.

1143
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,000
Right.

1144
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,900
Well yeah, after you, I guess when your tail when you perceive there

1145
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,800
to be no more you you aren't really gaining any more users I guess

1146
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,600
than you would say, okay.

1147
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:29,800
Well

1148
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,400
We'll finish.

1149
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,600
But yeah, so I guess what I would say though, there is what you're

1150
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,800
saying when you're saying like, you know, if there's some law or if

1151
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,800
there's something, I guess, what I was trying to say at the beginning

1152
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,800
was that that's what traditional purchasing models are traditional

1153
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,900
purchasing models are the best thing that we found for ensuring that

1154
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,600
what you sell is the thing, you are incentivized to make.

1155
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,700
That's what that is.

1156
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,200
It's because we don't know how to create a law that says, if we're

1157
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,700
paying generally money for this thing,

1158
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,600
Is do a good job, separating it.

1159
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,800
We don't know of a better way to do that.

1160
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,000
Right?

1161
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
If we did, we should replace capitalism in general with that concept.

1162
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Because man, that would be better, right?

1163
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,400
Yeah.

1164
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,300
So capitalism is just the only way we've actually found that like

1165
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,000
concept that there's a product with some profit margin built-in and

1166
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,700
you look to see what you might want.

1167
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,500
To spend your money on and you buy that thing.

1168
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,900
That is what we figured out that is that law.

1169
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,900
And so when you replace that with free-to-play, what you're doing is

1170
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,800
saying, you're saying, you don't want to play by that law anymore,

1171
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,800
you're saying you don't actually

1172
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,500
We want the law where people have to buy a particular thing.

1173
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,600
That is the thing that they actually are getting instead, you're

1174
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,500
trying to sort of bifurcate that and say, well, I don't feel like I

1175
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,200
can figure out a way to sell you this product as a product.

1176
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,800
So instead, I'm going to give it to you and then try to get you to do

1177
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,100
other things that will Generate random revenue for me.

1178
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,200
And that, like I said, despite anything that we said on the stream so

1179
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,400
far, really just sounds to me like a trust me, right?

1180
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,300
It's like, trust me.

1181
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,600
I won't make it Sleazy.

1182
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,800
And at the end of the day,

1183
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,300
Okay, you might not right, you might not do that, but that doesn't

1184
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,600
really change any arguments fundamentally about the business model,

1185
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,100
the business model itself still has none of that protection for the

1186
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,400
consumer built into it.

1187
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Whereas say even a model that was more like every four months we sell

1188
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,600
the update to this thing which is the new game set that people buy or

1189
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,200
something or a subscription model where you pay a small amount a

1190
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,400
dollar a month or something.

1191
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,900
Like this would have that built-in because now you're just

1192
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,800
incentivised to

1193
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,300
Give people a good overall experience and there is no need to create

1194
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,500
things where they're incentivized to shop to buy hats to do whatever

1195
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,900
which you know if you're fantastically lucky and maybe it's just you

1196
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,700
and Five Guys or whatever, hey you hit some, it's it hits big and you

1197
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,600
never have to worry.

1198
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,600
So you're not incentivised to make bad decisions all that much and

1199
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,200
you're a good guy.

1200
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
So it goes great or whatever.

1201
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,500
But think about the other case, where you're just, it's on the line.

1202
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,000
You don't know if you're going to make payroll next month and you can

1203
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,800
do this giant hat, promotion, or

1204
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,400
It's like, it's just not set up to incentivize good, behavior know.

1205
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,300
And like you said, okay, so that example, you just head right where

1206
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,200
you do the giant, you do the giant hat sailrite, okay?

1207
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,900
So you do the giant hat sale.

1208
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,600
Okay, so you have to do that, right?

1209
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,700
But the other

1210
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,400
The other you do that, giant has sold as temporary thing, by the way,

1211
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,700
don't mean.

1212
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,500
Like that's the whole game, but then it's a lot of money and then it's

1213
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,100
like, well, every quarter, we have, the giant hat sale.

1214
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,100
Okay let's just let's let's hypothetically say that happened.

1215
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,300
Yeah, a little slippery slope.

1216
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,900
I'm just I'm just giving you a stuffy whole, it's a slippery slope.

1217
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,300
Yeah, but like your example of we do a giant hat sale once every four

1218
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,700
months or three months, right?

1219
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,800
That's not so bad like that's not that's not the end of the world,

1220
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,200
right?

1221
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,500
Like if you change the game and you sacrifice, you know, development

1222
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,100
resources to do the hats or you, you know what, by hats everywhere,

1223
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,300
while you're playing the game or whatever, then you have a problem,

1224
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,100
how are you going to do a giant hat sale without doing the things?

1225
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,900
You just said, I mean, you have to put a ton of

1226
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,600
Art Resources by making the hundred hats of the Hat sale and the, and

1227
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,200
the hat Days of Christmas, right?

1228
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,700
The 12 days of hat, mess or whatever, right?

1229
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,200
I mean, we're right, isn't that exactly what we're talking about that?

1230
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:09,600
No.

1231
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,200
Okay, I don't think so.

1232
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,800
I think like to a degree.

1233
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,300
Yes.

1234
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,000
Right.

1235
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,100
But I think, when you, you have to take the other side of it to,

1236
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,800
right, which is you're getting ongoing revenue and you can use your

1237
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,200
ongoing Revenue to support ongoing development, right?

1238
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,400
And I think that's, that's really important.

1239
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,700
That's a

1240
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,400
It's a very important distinction between making your money up front.

1241
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
If you make your money up front, you can't do that.

1242
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,700
Now, you're talking about subscription and I think I think

1243
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,200
subscription is just just dead.

1244
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,400
I don't think you could do subscription.

1245
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,700
Like I don't think it's financially viable to do subscription.

1246
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,500
If you can prove me wrong.

1247
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,800
I'd like to hear examples, but from what I can tell, sorry, not

1248
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:51,100
Snapchat, sorry, WhatsApp, I mean for a game and what's app is free

1249
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,100
and dollar-a-month pressure?

1250
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm sorry dollar year, it was dollar a year.

1251
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,000
It was, but I'm pretty sure it's free now.

1252
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,800
Well, you have to Facebook

1253
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,300
Autumn.

1254
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,200
Okay, so it's been dead for three.

1255
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,000
Four, five years.

1256
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,200
Well, but they got, I mean, millions of people they had.

1257
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
I mean, how do you know how many users they had it with some

1258
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,600
ridiculously huge number, right?

1259
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,500
Yeah, blizzard had how many tens of millions or 10 million or whatever

1260
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,100
playing playing paying for while monthly they don't anymore?

1261
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,100
I don't know.

1262
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,400
Like that was that game is also I mean how old is that game?

1263
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,900
I don't even want to know how old I bet you they're making more money

1264
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,100
now with free to play to be honest than they ever were.

1265
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:27,800
Oh

1266
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,400
Yeah, and again, I will never argue with you that you will make more

1267
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,600
money if you want to go like the free-to-play route, right?

1268
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,600
It's a big money maker because it's a way of kind of sucker in people

1269
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,800
into something, right?

1270
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,800
And then charging them different ways that you figure out to, to

1271
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,700
charge them, right?

1272
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:45,800
But I could play.

1273
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,300
As you're like, I don't know, are you sure?

1274
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,200
This is scription can't work, right?

1275
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,500
I mean like pretty pretty, pretty sure.

1276
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,200
How like WhatsApp was was pretty late in the game, like Zynga had.

1277
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,800
It was already had come and gone by the time WhatsApp.

1278
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,500
I was charging a dollar a year for.

1279
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,200
Okay.

1280
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,200
Okay, so let's use it.

1281
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,800
Let's, I'd like to hear a game example, right?

1282
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,200
Because from what I could tell, every game is getting off of

1283
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,000
subscription and going to free to play.

1284
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,200
Now that could be just to maximize Revenue, I don't know, but the

1285
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,300
counter, the other argue, the other side of like, my two points about

1286
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,700
why I thought freedom play was best.

1287
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,600
The other side is

1288
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,900
Sorry what was said, I've already lost my train of thought, sorry, the

1289
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,400
other side was we did as many people as possible in order to get

1290
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,300
balance data to get data to balance the game right now because she's

1291
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,800
supremely important like the number one.

1292
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,300
Most important thing is if we get 100 million people playing the game

1293
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,300
or whatever ridiculous number, we can get like 10 million, people

1294
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,600
100,000 people playing the game would be fantastic.

1295
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,200
That gives us enough data to actually make it tells you balance

1296
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:45,800
positions, right?

1297
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,000
I don't think we can, we can get that.

1298
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,300
With without it being free, I just don't think that the end.

1299
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,100
I don't think people are willing to spend a dollar a month, even?

1300
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,800
I just don't like if you can if there's a game that you can point me

1301
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,900
to where they've actually successfully recently in the last two years,

1302
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:06,300
successfully run a subscription model, I would like to hear it because

1303
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,600
I haven't heard, I don't know of any.

1304
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,600
What does Eve online do?

1305
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,800
By the way, Eve online is weird.

1306
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,300
There are subscription but you can you can buy in game, you can buy

1307
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,800
your subscription cards with in-game

1308
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,500
Currency.

1309
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:25,100
So people make money off of like creating in-game currency by blowing

1310
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,000
up ships, and salvaging them, and stuff, and then buying time cards

1311
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,100
and then selling those.

1312
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,500
So very interesting concept, okay?

1313
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,000
Eve is one of the most interesting games, okay, out there.

1314
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,700
If you're ever interested in reading about fiction in games, you

1315
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,800
should read about Eve protection because like the Russian mafia lost

1316
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,200
two hundred fifty thousand dollars in like one day and there was a

1317
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,300
huge drama but it it's really great.

1318
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,000
It's great.

1319
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:48,500
Anyways.

1320
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,100
So no I do are they like is their revenue, then coming from a

1321
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,300
subscriptions that was a couple years ago when I learned about that.

1322
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,400
I don't know about it now but maybe but I bet you it's purely

1323
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,100
historical.

1324
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:00,700
Okay.

1325
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,600
I mean games that are like new games that have come up because Eve has

1326
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,500
been around for 10 years or whatever.

1327
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,700
Well, here's another question for you.

1328
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,300
So, how much money are you expecting people to spend on this game

1329
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,700
every month in general with your FTP model?

1330
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:17,600
Okay.

1331
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,900
That's a that's a pretty complex question.

1332
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,000
Do you mean just median dollar spent per user playing or do?

1333
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,500
You mean, like they're okay, two bucks.

1334
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:31,600
Two bucks bucks.

1335
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,200
Two bucks a month on average per person.

1336
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,400
So basically we're talking 20 for dollars a year.

1337
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,900
Yeah, so basically it's like them buying a game buying your game at

1338
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,700
retail or whatever, you know, on on steam or something once every year

1339
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,500
once every two years, something like that.

1340
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,700
Well I don't know what your price point is, could be $25, right?

1341
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,100
It would be.

1342
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,600
This is going to be like a pretty like DOTA level quality so tissue.

1343
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,400
So it might not be every two years.

1344
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,800
It would be every year then because

1345
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,200
Have to pay twenty four dollars a year for a DOTA level games.

1346
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,300
Going to be 25 bucks, not not 12.

1347
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,200
If you played it and see the quality of the voice acting and all that

1348
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,400
fun stuff, I'm just saying it's yeah what I'm saying.

1349
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,800
It should be 25 and you're going to be 12 every two years would.

1350
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,500
Oh sorry I'm saying I'm saying it should be like 60 bucks.

1351
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,100
Okay.

1352
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,600
So it's more like it's about twice a year.

1353
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,500
You have to buy it at the beginning of the year and in the middle of

1354
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,600
the year or something like that.

1355
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,500
Am I getting my math wrong?

1356
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,100
If I'm spending $25 every year.

1357
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,800
That's $50 every two years.

1358
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,900
Ears, which would be buying the game once every two years.

1359
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,000
Never mind.

1360
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,300
Yes.

1361
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,400
I guess that's true.

1362
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,700
Okay, you're doing your math, right?

1363
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,300
Okay.

1364
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,600
You're doing your math rock.

1365
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,500
That is correct.

1366
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,700
All right, at least one of us was all right.

1367
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,700
So they have to buy the game once every two years and how long is this

1368
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,700
game going to be running for?

1369
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:56,100
This is the this is where I think that I'm being super non benevolent

1370
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,000
dictator e here.

1371
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,300
Once the game is like once we shut down production and shut down

1372
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:04,900
servers or whatever the game is either public domain or GPL with all

1373
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,800
Assets available as well.

1374
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:13,600
So the game will run until we don't run it anymore at which point

1375
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,900
everything is released for free.

1376
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,800
But what is your goal for house?

1377
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,900
10 years, 10 years.

1378
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,200
So basically what you're talking about is people, if they were going

1379
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,500
to buy this game in general,

1380
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:32,400
Over 10 years time you want them to spend something on the order of

1381
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,000
250 dollars on your game?

1382
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:34,900
Yes.

1383
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,900
$250 per player over 10 years sure which would translate into

1384
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,600
something like buying the 50 dollar game five times.

1385
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:50,100
Yeah, okay, and so, in your opinion, there's no way you could do that

1386
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:54,000
in that actual way, meaning you could not do something where you sold

1387
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,500
the game up front and they bought an expansion pack, every couple

1388
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,400
years or something like this.

1389
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,700
That's not on the table.

1390
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,400
No, that's that's that doesn't work.

1391
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,100
That that makes the game worse and it makes the game worse because

1392
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,600
there's a whole bunch of reasons why making it more.

1393
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,400
So let's say you and I play together to Team game, right?

1394
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,300
So we're friends, we play against it, we play with each other, right?

1395
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,100
I'm financially able

1396
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,400
Purchase the game and you're not right now.

1397
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,100
The game is segregated where you can't play with your friend.

1398
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,600
Because one person could purchase the game of one person.

1399
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,900
Can't write if the game is just completely free for everybody with no.

1400
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:32,900
Like you all non cosmetic items are unlocked for everybody at all

1401
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:33,400
times.

1402
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,600
It means that everybody plays the exact same game all the time and

1403
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,700
there's no segregation which you would get with the.

1404
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,000
You have to buy the game every six months or every year or whatever.

1405
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:44,900
Okay.

1406
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,300
But so that's Switching gears a little bit that's not really talking

1407
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,200
about the financial side of things that's talking about more of the

1408
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
accessibility of

1409
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:52,700
Of this game.

1410
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:57,800
Yes, no, I'm not stalking with making the best game possible for the

1411
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,800
people who are playing it point of

1412
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,600
Like if you're, if we're talking about, I'm my argument is that in

1413
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:08,700
this particular situation, doing free-to-play is the best option for

1414
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,800
the people who are playing.

1415
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,700
And I don't, maybe that's, that's what, that's what, that's what I'm

1416
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,600
that's where I'm coming from, right?

1417
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:16,800
Okay.

1418
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,400
I just think put that part of it aside.

1419
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,800
For one second, I was trying to just finish off our discussion on the

1420
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,000
actual payment model.

1421
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,900
Is there a problem with selling the game?

1422
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,400
That way?

1423
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,800
If you factored out the the social aspect that you were starting to

1424
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,600
bring into it there where you want everyone to be able to access the

1425
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,000
game.

1426
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,600
I was trying to figure out there any other business models that you

1427
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,200
consider potential possible, or if you think that literally FTP is the

1428
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:40,900
only one that

1429
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,800
Actually works because that's sort of more where I thought you were

1430
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,200
saying before you were like subscriptions dead.

1431
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,400
We can't sell this game.

1432
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,800
I was like, okay, why can't you sell the game again?

1433
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,300
Just remind me of why you can't just sell this game.

1434
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:52,800
Okay.

1435
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,600
So that's why we can't just sell the game is because there's ongoing

1436
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,800
things and we have to run the server and the game is going to be

1437
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,900
constantly changing.

1438
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,000
And if we sold the game, the way you just said it, segregates, the

1439
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,800
game for different people in your accessibility thing comes up, but if

1440
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,900
you don't care about the accessibility, then you could sell the game

1441
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,300
that way.

1442
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:13,900
You don't think so you could like you're saying, is it financially

1443
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,400
viable.

1444
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,100
Yeah.

1445
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,400
In other words, do you feel?

1446
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,400
Like there are reasons you couldn't just sell the game as a product

1447
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,800
that are separate from what you who you want to be able to access it?

1448
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:29,400
Well, I don't know, but I don't think you can just separate who you

1449
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,000
want to be able to access it because those are like, like, let's say

1450
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,800
you buy the game and two years later, your buddy wants to play it,

1451
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,600
John Blow or

1452
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,100
He likes it, he finds out about it, he's like, I want to play this

1453
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,100
game, he buys it.

1454
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:46,200
And now you have to pay like, $200 to catch up to him or whatever or

1455
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,000
pay fifty dollars, or whatever.

1456
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,400
After you've already bought it once, like that's just that's weird,

1457
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:52,600
right?

1458
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,800
Like that, like that demanding, that people pay money in order to

1459
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,200
continue playing it or like, separating it.

1460
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,500
So that these are the people who have spent money this, this quarter

1461
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,700
or, is this half year or whatever it is.

1462
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,400
And these are the people who haven't that's just weird.

1463
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:08,600
And probably makes the

1464
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,900
Game worse and like that just doesn't sound.

1465
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,200
That sounds like it makes the game worse for players, and I don't

1466
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,300
think that you can separate that from well.

1467
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,300
Hold on anything.

1468
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,300
I mean, keep in mind though that it's, it's all the same amount of

1469
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,000
money, right?

1470
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,800
That we're talking about here.

1471
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,500
So somebody had to still pay $250 worth of cosmetic hats or something,

1472
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,100
to make it up in the in your other case, right?

1473
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,800
In the words that you can't just say, like, oh okay, well it's weird

1474
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,000
to charge people for the game that they're actually playing.

1475
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,600
Because somehow now it's considered

1476
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,400
Weird, I guess for people to pay for the game that they're playing.

1477
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,700
But it's not considered weird that we're expecting the average player

1478
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,900
to spend $250.

1479
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:47,800
Buying hats.

1480
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,900
Mmm, that's what you just said.

1481
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:50,800
If I may.

1482
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,000
Okay, let's go ahead and say that.

1483
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That's what I said.

1484
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,700
Well, tell me how that's not what you said.

1485
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,100
I guess it's more of the interesting part.

1486
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,600
You're thinking not okay to expect someone to buy this game.

1487
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,300
Every time I would love to do know.

1488
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,600
It's you totally could expect somebody to.

1489
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,800
I just don't think people are willing to spend it.

1490
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,900
So you said it was weird to say.

1491
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,200
I think it's about here, is that?

1492
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,100
Yes, I think I think.

1493
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,600
I think it's we, I do think it's and then it makes the game worse.

1494
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,000
Those are the two things you said, yes.

1495
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And I do think it's true.

1496
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,500
Look at take a look at Starcraft 2, for example, right?

1497
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,100
Not my favorite game.

1498
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,400
Quite awful.

1499
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,600
Game actually, but

1500
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,100
Every couple of years that come out with a new expansion set, right?

1501
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,800
And if you don't buy that expansion set you just you can't play the

1502
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,200
game anymore, right?

1503
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,400
So you've bought a game you've spent your $60 or whatever and you

1504
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,000
wanted to keep playing it now, you can't put anymore because no one is

1505
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
playing that version.

1506
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,800
They're only playing the upgraded version, right?

1507
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,200
So in order for you to continue playing, you have to pay right, right?

1508
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:51,900
Okay.

1509
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,500
So that that is how that model works, right?

1510
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:54,900
Right.

1511
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,700
That's a worse.

1512
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,300
That's worse for the player, I think.

1513
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:58,600
Okay.

1514
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,800
That is that worse.

1515
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,300
the player that basically means that if you don't want to play this

1516
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,200
game anymore,

1517
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
you don't pay the Developers for the work that they did over the past

1518
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,800
two years, right?

1519
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,000
Mmm, why is that weird?

1520
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,000
What's so weird about that to you?

1521
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,500
Because there's there's a social pressure of because it's a team game

1522
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,100
and it's a multiplayer game, there's a social pressure of playing with

1523
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,100
your friends right?

1524
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:30,600
And if your friends are all paying $100 or whatever they're forcing

1525
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,000
your almost that's almost forced upon you to continue playing the game

1526
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,900
where if it's free to play you just don't write like you just don't

1527
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,600
pay and you can still play, right?

1528
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,800
Like when we

1529
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,700
Who says that right?

1530
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,000
Somebody has to buy another $250 worth of hats to cover their not Hat

1531
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,200
by.

1532
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,300
Yes, that's absolutely true.

1533
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,800
And you don't think that's weird.

1534
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:53,700
I do think that's weird.

1535
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,500
Do you think it's less weird?

1536
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,100
Yes.

1537
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:57,800
I think it's.

1538
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,900
I think it's less.

1539
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,300
I think it's equally weird.

1540
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:05,300
Maybe more weird but whoa okay but its overall

1541
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:07,600
Impact.

1542
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:13,400
T' on the quality of the game for the average player.

1543
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,399
If we're concerned about the quality of the game, experience for the

1544
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:20,399
average player playing, I think the free-to-play model delivers a

1545
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:22,800
better quality because you're just going to get more people playing.

1546
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,000
And the more people playing means, the more competitively viable.

1547
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,500
The game is means the more the the less wait time there is when

1548
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,300
finding a match all of these things, right?

1549
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,899
The more people that are playing the better, the game is, right?

1550
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:39,500
So if you say you have to pay your alienating people, right?

1551
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,000
So that's just flat-out, true?

1552
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,100
And you're there for the game quality is going to be suffering.

1553
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:44,700
Now, if you are

1554
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,700
Alienate people every six months or whatever.

1555
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,800
You're never going to get, like, your player count is never going to

1556
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,399
go up.

1557
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,300
It's only going to continuously, go down and as your player count goes

1558
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,300
down the quality of your game goes down.

1559
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,800
And that would mean that.

1560
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:04,100
The method that you're saying of paid fifty dollars every two years or

1561
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:08,000
whatever, you're getting a worst game, the longer the game goes on.

1562
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,100
Okay.

1563
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:14,500
But is that actually true meaning that like do so from what you're

1564
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,899
sort of suggesting right?

1565
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,200
If what if everything that you're saying was actually true, we should

1566
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,800
have expected League of Legends to be fantastic right now.

1567
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:22,500
Right?

1568
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:29,600
Because well right, so what y if this model is encouraging this and

1569
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,899
Starcraft should be much a much worse game than League of Legends,

1570
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:33,500
right?

1571
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,200
It probably is about the about, they're both equally bad.

1572
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:36,300
Okay?

1573
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,300
They're both equally bad.

1574
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,600
I haven't played either them so I have no idea.

1575
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,300
I played the original Starcraft but I haven't played one since then.

1576
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,000
Okay.

1577
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,100
I think you're actually talking about Starcraft 2, not sorry.

1578
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,500
I'm sorry about your Starcraft to start off.

1579
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,000
One is a fantastic game, okay?

1580
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:50,200
Yes.

1581
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,300
Okay, so Starcraft 2, I don't know, I don't think there is a

1582
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,300
significant quality difference between Starcraft 2.

1583
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,300
I mean, there's a quality difference between Starcraft, 2 and League

1584
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,300
of Legends, Starcraft 2 is clearly a much higher.

1585
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,800
It's made by blizzard, they know

1586
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,800
Doing right, we're Riot.

1587
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:08,000
I don't necessarily think they do, so I don't think they're that there

1588
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,500
is any correlation between either of these models and quality in the

1589
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,400
real world, okay?

1590
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,300
So you think that's actually unrelated

1591
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,000
I don't know if I don't know, I don't know.

1592
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:21,900
I'm gonna say yes.

1593
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,900
And if you come back with something where I'm clearly wrong, I'm fully

1594
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,000
willing to change my mind on this.

1595
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,800
But yes, for the moment I'm going to say they're more or less

1596
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,500
unrelated.

1597
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:32,200
Okay, I'm saying, but I'm saying both models produced for the most

1598
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,600
part crap, bad situations, or higher in everything produces a bad

1599
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,900
situation for the most part.

1600
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:38,600
Okay.

1601
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,100
Well I mean, I guess like I said it's a certain extent.

1602
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:47,800
I think most of this is continuously keeps coming back to the fact

1603
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,800
that I don't

1604
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,600
Holistic Lee know how much argument there is to be had here?

1605
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,500
Because even that statement right kind of just says you're almost

1606
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,500
saying the model is really it's not even really an argument it's

1607
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,300
because it's just like trust me.

1608
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,500
I'm going to do something different than everyone else does.

1609
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,800
Anyway so again we're kind of back to the like why is this an okay

1610
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,400
decision?

1611
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,900
It's an okay decision because I'm not going to mess it up basically,

1612
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,400
right?

1613
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,700
No I stay I get well yes but not just that like I actually think and I

1614
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:18,800
think

1615
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,500
Ink that it's from what I've said.

1616
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,300
It's pretty truthful.

1617
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:29,800
I think that free-to-play actually has the potential to produce, at

1618
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,600
least the way I want to do.

1619
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,500
It has the potential to produce a better gaming experience for the

1620
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,200
average player playing.

1621
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,700
And I don't think that's true of this early any existing free-to-play

1622
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:44,100
models but or any existing free-to-play implementations, but I

1623
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,300
certainly think that that's true for this case.

1624
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,700
Like I actually think it will produce a better game, which is why I

1625
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:48,800
think,

1626
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,800
it's a totally viable business model well, and you do realize that it

1627
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,500
does sound a little bit suspicious when you say something like

1628
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,900
No, existing free-to-play game.

1629
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
Ever actually satisfied.

1630
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,700
The criteria that I'm talking about, but I think this new one that I'm

1631
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:10,700
going to do won't have the problem.

1632
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,300
Whereas, on the other hand, we do have plenty of examples of people

1633
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:18,700
who sell their games who don't have this problem, right?

1634
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:18,900
Yes.

1635
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,100
You're plenty of examples of people some games that have is similar,

1636
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,400
not obviously the same issue, but similar at the whole issue is right.

1637
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,800
But one thing we have positive examples in one case where as the case

1638
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,100
Talking about, we have no positive examples face, okay.

1639
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:32,300
Okay.

1640
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,900
But that's not a reason to totally throw something away.

1641
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,600
It's not, but you have to understand, that's what you're basically

1642
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:37,900
saying.

1643
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,800
So you're saying, we have no evidence that this model works but I'm

1644
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,000
still saying, trust me, I'm going to make it work.

1645
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,500
Do I think?

1646
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:47,400
I think Dota 2 is better off being free to play.

1647
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Okay, I think if Dota 2 charged money for the game.

1648
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,900
It would be a less good game.

1649
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,100
Okay, I'm not saying that they're doing it ethically.

1650
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,600
I'm like 100% ethically.

1651
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,800
I'm saying that that business model makes that game better.

1652
01:12:59,600 --> 01:12:59,900
Okay.

1653
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:02,500
So you think that but I can just get back to the FTP thing.

1654
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,700
So you're actually saying that you think Dota 2 is an example of a

1655
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,200
positive f2p game.

1656
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,700
Yes, yes, I'm saying that but I'm not saying that it is that it meets

1657
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:20,000
what I would consider my minimum moral or minimum ethical standards or

1658
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,400
whatever.

1659
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,300
Okay, so you have minimum ethical standards and you don't know of a

1660
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,600
free-to-play game that meets them.

1661
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,200
I don't over free to play game that made some that's true.

1662
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,400
And I do think that Dota 2 kind of comes close and I think that Dota 2

1663
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,400
is better off being free to play the not being free to play.

1664
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,400
Do you know, any of examples of games that you just?

1665
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,500
People just sell like a traditional game, where you buy it that meet

1666
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,900
your minimum ethical standards.

1667
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Nowadays.

1668
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah, there's plenty of small.

1669
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,300
There's plenty of indie games to do.

1670
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:51,900
Okay.

1671
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,300
From a big Corporation, though.

1672
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,700
I don't think so, but so just to get back to the just just so we can

1673
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,000
solidify that one point.

1674
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,500
So, we are, at least in agreement that there are no examples of

1675
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,400
free-to-play games that meet your ethical standards at all.

1676
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,100
But there are examples of games that just people buy that, do meet

1677
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:11,200
your minimum ethical standards.

1678
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,000
Yes.

1679
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,300
Does that trouble you at all?

1680
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,600
Know why not

1681
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,500
Is none of the games that meet my minimal, ethical standards are

1682
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,800
multiplayer.

1683
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:29,000
Esport type games that require maintenance constant maintenance

1684
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,300
overtime to keep the game.

1685
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,600
Good and constant work on back-end infrastructure and server and all

1686
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:36,600
that fun stuff, right?

1687
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:41,300
So, none of the games have the expenses or the long, the long-term

1688
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:46,000
expenses and development costs of one of these games that you do by.

1689
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:46,600
And that,

1690
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,600
I consider ethical.

1691
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,200
So there's a difference there between what the product actually is,

1692
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:51,700
right?

1693
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:52,800
No game.

1694
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,000
That does what I'm saying with this long-term server stuff and

1695
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,400
long-term development stuff, no game that does that?

1696
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,700
That's

1697
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,900
Old in a store is ethical, in my opinion.

1698
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:09,000
Well I guess what I just to clarify though, that is an example or

1699
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,900
that's an explanation of why you believe, you must try the

1700
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,800
free-to-play model.

1701
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:15,500
That is not an explanation of why.

1702
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:20,200
It doesn't worry you that you are that you have no positive examples

1703
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,200
of something meeting your minimum ethical bar.

1704
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,100
Oh, but I'm saying that I have no positive examples of a game that had

1705
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:25,500
that

1706
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,600
has its long-term.

1707
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,300
I'm saying that I have no positive examples of a game that has the

1708
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,500
long-term requirements that we have, that's sold in a store either.

1709
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:40,400
There's just no positive examples, period, free to play or not free to

1710
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:47,100
play of games that have this sort of ongoing thing that I are.

1711
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:49,100
You feeling hungry thing like literally in the store right now,

1712
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:49,400
though.

1713
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,700
I mean, I'm assuming if you look in history, you'd find lots, right?

1714
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,000
Like wouldn't Ultima Online or EverQuest those those

1715
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,400
Meet that criteria.

1716
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,300
I I think Ultima Online.

1717
01:15:59,300 --> 01:15:59,500
What?

1718
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,500
I don't know all too well.

1719
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,400
How about Guild Wars?

1720
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:01,800
Guild Wars?

1721
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,000
Doesn't meet that criteria.

1722
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,100
They're free to play know the I'm talking about in history.

1723
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:10,600
So the original Guild Wars was $40 every every year or something like

1724
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:10,700
that.

1725
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,400
That was their model.

1726
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:11,800
You bought.

1727
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,300
You bought the latest Guild Wars.

1728
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:14,800
Yeah, that would do fine.

1729
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,300
I would, I would prefer, you know, how much more I would prefer to do

1730
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,900
that, but I don't think it.

1731
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,500
I don't think that's, I don't think it'll work.

1732
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,800
I just I flat out, don't I don't think it'll work and I don't think

1733
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,000
it's actually as good for the game.

1734
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,500
Okay.

1735
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,600
So, but again, just to get back to the original question.

1736
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,400
Yep.

1737
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,300
No, there are no examples in anything.

1738
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,200
There are no free to play examples that I consider ethically sound and

1739
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,300
that does not worry.

1740
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,400
You, that was my question.

1741
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,900
Why doesn't it worry you

1742
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,600
That's what I think it does worry.

1743
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,000
I like we're having this discussion, right?

1744
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
So clearly clearly it does worry me.

1745
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,400
Okay.

1746
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,300
All right.

1747
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,200
So you like, or at least what you do at least worry about this?

1748
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:56,700
Well yes.

1749
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,500
Otherwise I wouldn't be having this conversation right.

1750
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,100
Okay, okay.

1751
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,400
Alright so that's good.

1752
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,500
Okay, so let's let's move on.

1753
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:05,100
I think we've kind of got that under control at least.

1754
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,200
All right I think I feel like or at least if you have some additional

1755
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,900
things that you feel like you haven't explored about your thoughts on

1756
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,500
that part of it, we can go there but I do know I've got most of that

1757
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:14,600
out.

1758
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:15,700
Yeah, I think that's good.

1759
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:16,400
I was sorry.

1760
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,300
I was confused with with, okay, what were you trying to get there?

1761
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:23,400
But yes, okay, so let me ask a question about the thing that you

1762
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,900
brought up before, which was sort of, you sort of started to say, and

1763
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,600
it sounded like a lot of what you were sort of talking about in terms

1764
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,700
of why you don't want to sell the game.

1765
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:35,400
You kept saying, you think it would make it worse game and what it

1766
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,300
sounded like you kept coming back to was the concept that you would

1767
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:43,800
like there to be a symmetric payments on the part of the users,

1768
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,300
meaning,

1769
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:49,200
You want it to be the case that some people don't pay for the game.

1770
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:51,000
And some people pay a lot of money for the game.

1771
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,200
That is what you were sort of saying, right?

1772
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,400
Is that a correct statement of what you were saying before about?

1773
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,700
That's a good thing in your mind you have to quantify a lot, right?

1774
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,800
Like I'm, I'm not, okay.

1775
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
With, you know, the people spend ten thousand dollars or whatever on a

1776
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,400
free to play game, like I'm not okay with that.

1777
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,800
We have some ideas about how to alleviate that such as once.

1778
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,100
You hit a certain amount of expenses for the month, like, one idea

1779
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:14,400
that we have is like, let's say, fifty dollars, which is a $50.

1780
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:18,500
If you spend $50 for a month, you just get everything unlocked for the

1781
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:21,000
rest of the month or whatever and whatever you paid for like, Whatever

1782
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,700
item you bought.

1783
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,900
You still get to keep those for future months, but that way Wales

1784
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,700
won't spend more than $50 a month.

1785
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,000
Like there's a hard cap on it, right?

1786
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,800
If you do spend more,

1787
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,100
Or.

1788
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:32,400
You're not getting anything, right?

1789
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:36,500
So there are things that I want to do to make sure that that doesn't

1790
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:36,800
happen.

1791
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,000
Right?

1792
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,500
Where people are spending ten thousand dollars or you know five

1793
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:44,400
hundred dollars a month or I don't want to Star Citizen situation but

1794
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:48,300
the asymmetric payment within bounds I think is okay.

1795
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,400
Yeah, okay.

1796
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:56,500
So basically what you're saying there is you want a sort of a

1797
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,800
non-explicit self-balancing market where some people

1798
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:04,700
Get a service for free because somebody else paid too much for it,

1799
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,700
right?

1800
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,100
If you want to say too much.

1801
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:10,900
That's I don't know if too much is fair, but because the median price,

1802
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,100
right?

1803
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,100
This is the cost to the everyone.

1804
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,500
To play this game was going to be two dollars and fifty cents a month

1805
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:17,900
or something.

1806
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,200
You said I but whatever you say, it was hypothetical number right?

1807
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,500
But sure.

1808
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:20,900
Yeah.

1809
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,700
So the median cost me 250 and so we're basically saying is some people

1810
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:29,200
will get to fifty two dollars and fifty cents worth of game

1811
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,800
development and of course we're still

1812
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,900
Still not sure about that part.

1813
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,700
So maybe let's say they're getting a dollar or two dollars of game

1814
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:35,900
development and 50 cents.

1815
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,300
They're not getting because that's into the Cosmetics, right?

1816
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,000
Because you're saying basically you're allocating These funds in some

1817
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,600
percentage way, so I don't know.

1818
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,700
But let's just say it's some reason percentage of that.

1819
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,100
So you're doing this on the graphing, you are virtuous person.

1820
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,800
So out of every two dollars and fifty cents, you're actually spending

1821
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,400
$2 on developing the game not cosmetic items or something like this.

1822
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,100
Let's just check.

1823
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,000
Sure.

1824
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,600
Sure, sure.

1825
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,200
We are good.

1826
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,700
A good portion of, yes.

1827
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,100
Pharaoh something, something that's pretty high, right?

1828
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,800
You're only putting 50 Cent's towards the actual money, making part.

1829
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,100
You're spending $2 on something everyone gets right?

1830
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,200
Well this part there's there's company profit involved to so would

1831
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,100
actually be less than that.

1832
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,300
But yes, but yes but it's relatively magnanimous compared to what you

1833
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,400
could be doing which is spending, say 50 cents on the game and two

1834
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,000
dollars on the monetization, right?

1835
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You mean you could be right, you could back percentage could change

1836
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,300
wildly but yeah, whatever it is sure.

1837
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:30,500
So, what I'm saying is for every person who doesn't pay 250 a month,

1838
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:31,300
Right?

1839
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,600
Someone else has to pay five dollars a month, right?

1840
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:38,800
So someone else is getting in terms of gameplay, they're getting

1841
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:43,200
still, you know, they're shorted a certain amount on the actual game.

1842
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,900
But someone else is getting that that for free basically, right.

1843
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:49,500
Yes, but I don't like your usage of the word too much.

1844
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,000
It's all like what to say above.

1845
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,600
The median is fine, but I think too much carries too much negative

1846
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,100
connotation.

1847
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:59,200
Okay, they're paying for I guess.

1848
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,800
I don't know how

1849
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,900
It, let's call it a subsidy.

1850
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:08,700
They are subsidizing, perhaps we should say players who are not

1851
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,400
playing for the game, because without them, we all the people who are

1852
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,700
paying more for the game.

1853
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,700
None of the other people would be able to play the game who aren't

1854
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,600
paying for it right now.

1855
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,100
Absolute.

1856
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,300
Right.

1857
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,000
So that's that's kind of the idea, right?

1858
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,600
Absolutely.

1859
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,900
And so this to you, you think that's a good idea, meaning you think

1860
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:28,100
it's good to have a market where basically some people pay more money

1861
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,800
for something so that other people don't

1862
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,200
Have to pay for that thing but that is not actually structured in any

1863
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:34,600
reason away.

1864
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,500
So meaning the person who doesn't pay, 250 might have the 250.

1865
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,900
They just decide not to pay it and the person who pays the five

1866
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:43,000
dollars, that may actually be their last five dollars.

1867
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,200
That doesn't actually matter.

1868
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,800
It's just you like that system in general irrespective.

1869
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,300
Well, I mean, if somebody spends their last five dollars, there might

1870
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,300
be, you know, no, I don't like that.

1871
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:59,400
But yeah, in general, I mean, I think,

1872
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,200
It's too black and white in the way in which your framing it.

1873
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:07,100
I think, because you're just you're flat out your enticing, the

1874
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,500
somebody's going to have to spend a hundred thousand dollars on this

1875
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,800
so that you know, 25,000 people are 20,000 people or whatever can get

1876
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,400
it for free, right?

1877
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,200
Like that's where you're going with this and I don't think that's

1878
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,300
really fair necessarily.

1879
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,000
I wasn't going there, I was actually trying.

1880
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,700
I'm actually trying to get you to describe to me what you are thinking

1881
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:26,800
of, in terms of who pays for what and is that fair?

1882
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:29,800
Yeah, I think I think it's totally fair that some

1883
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:34,000
People who are willing to and able to subsidize for people who aren't

1884
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,200
willing are our table.

1885
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,600
Yeah, I think that's totally fair.

1886
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,600
I mean I think that if you look at I mean, this is this is a grandiose

1887
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:41,400
claim or whatever.

1888
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:44,400
But I think if you look at any sorry, I keep shitting on your country.

1889
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,300
But if you look at any water and why it might not be as much as you

1890
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,800
did probably, all right.

1891
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,100
Well, if you look at any more like a modern reasonable, industrialized

1892
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,200
Nation, they have things like subsidized health, care and subsidy, all

1893
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,300
sorts of subsidies subsidized.

1894
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:59,800
Childcare subsidized, everything, where there is

1895
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Payment people who are able to pay pay more and you know I'm not a

1896
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,400
government.

1897
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:09,600
I don't have the ability to enforce people who are able versus people

1898
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,700
who are unwilling, right?

1899
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,500
So they're the same thing as far as I'm concerned.

1900
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,800
So I mean they're not the same thing as far as the government is

1901
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,300
concerned but there's same thing as far as me as a game developer are

1902
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:18,900
concerned, right?

1903
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,700
So yes people who are able to pay more

1904
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,000
Do and people who are less able.

1905
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,900
Don't I don't think there's anything wrong with that now.

1906
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:27,200
Okay?

1907
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,600
So yeah, if I could expand on that, because that is exactly, that's

1908
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,800
what I'm assuming was the answer.

1909
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:32,400
Okay.

1910
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,400
So I do have a number of problems with that.

1911
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,000
So the first problem I have with that is I don't think it constructs

1912
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
much of an analogy to socialism, because in socialism, you have a

1913
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,100
system where you actually are at least trying to be nominally

1914
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,000
needs-based.

1915
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,200
Meaning it really actually is trying to assess whether somebody can

1916
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,500
pay for a thing or not and the

1917
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,500
idea behind you.

1918
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:57,400
No more of a socialist run system is that we try to make sure that

1919
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,800
everyone gets this service and the people who can pay

1920
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,400
It pays to pay more for it, than the people who can't write okay, in

1921
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,900
your model, that's not true at.

1922
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:06,600
All right?

1923
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,800
Somebody may have lots of money and they just decide not to pay for

1924
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,600
this game and then other users who want to see that, you know, let's

1925
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,100
say, we're in hard times, right?

1926
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,000
It's a question about whether your games going to stay up and running

1927
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,600
a bunch of users, who really don't potentially have the money to be

1928
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,900
spending on this and possibly should be doing something else like

1929
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,800
saving for retirement with that money or doing whatever else, right

1930
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:29,900
start buying more items because they want to keep

1931
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,100
the game afloat, right?

1932
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,800
There's nothing in the system that you're talking about.

1933
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,400
That actually has a needs component.

1934
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
The only thing that's there is basically a hard cap, which says that

1935
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,700
literally, if this person doesn't physically have any money,

1936
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,300
obviously, they couldn't spend it.

1937
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,800
But other than that, I don't see anything in your system, which

1938
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,100
actually does ensure that the people who are more, who are getting the

1939
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,200
service and can pay for it actually do.

1940
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,800
Yeah, there's not obviously, right, but there but I think with the

1941
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,600
Monthly limit.

1942
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,800
You're not getting the sort of ridiculous, whales that you hear about,

1943
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:05,900
right?

1944
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:10,200
You're not getting the Star Citizen 88,000 dollars for spaceship

1945
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:10,500
thing, right?

1946
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,000
Like that's you can't do it.

1947
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,700
You can't spend more than whatever we decide the monthly cap is let's

1948
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,600
say it's 50 bucks.

1949
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,200
That's high.

1950
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,000
But let's say let's just say it's 50 dollars because that's probably a

1951
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,800
reasonable number.

1952
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:26,800
So we say if you spend more than $50 this month, you get every item

1953
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,400
for the rest of the month, completely for free.

1954
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:29,900
So you

1955
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,500
You we've actually implemented a hard cap.

1956
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,300
I want you could spend.

1957
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:40,200
So if we do that, then the concern about like if you are spending

1958
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:45,100
money that you don't have on a video game and you're talking about

1959
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:52,600
less than $50 per month, you know like okay maybe that's bad like

1960
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:57,000
clearly that's bad but I don't think that that's my responsibility at

1961
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,600
that point if it's capped at such like a, you know, reasonable

1962
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:00,300
Brr.

1963
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,600
Well, let's talk about the cap then because that actually brings up

1964
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,900
another interesting point, right?

1965
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:04,300
Okay.

1966
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:09,200
So the game will go out of business.

1967
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,200
If you keep the cap in place but it's clear from the data that the

1968
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,500
game would stay in business.

1969
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,300
If you raise the cap from fifty to a hundred dollars, do you raise the

1970
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:18,800
cap?

1971
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,700
From 50 to 100?

1972
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,300
No no I don't think so.

1973
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:27,300
So you're going to commit upfront to saying that we're going to State

1974
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:30,600
a cap and we're never going to change that cap that cat is fixed.

1975
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:31,000
Yep.

1976
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,500
Right.

1977
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,900
And that'll by being fixed with inflation, you know?

1978
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,800
You know, okay.

1979
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,400
Something crazy might happen, right?

1980
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,000
Oh noes.

1981
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,200
So basically like you're going to be the first f2p game that needs

1982
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:46,200
like treasury backed Securities that you check every to see what you

1983
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,200
can spend on it that month in order to get the the items lat.

1984
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,500
That's precisely, it'll be adjusted on a day-to-day basis with the

1985
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,000
CPI, okay.

1986
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,000
All right.

1987
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,800
I'm just saying, like, like in five years, we might be like, okay, the

1988
01:26:58,800 --> 01:26:59,800
cap $75,

1989
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,300
That because inflation is right, right whatever.

1990
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,000
But yes that that cap will be stated up front.

1991
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:09,700
Okay, well, wait a minute, it would be seated up front but could be

1992
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:14,500
raised, I'm saying only with only like with I'm saying that the cap

1993
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:18,800
will never be raised but I'm also saying that like if something crazy

1994
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,000
happens where the u.s.

1995
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,800
and Canadian dollar just go fucking whack, right?

1996
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:27,300
And a dollar now is worth 25 cents, right than the cap, has to be

1997
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,800
raised in order to account for that.

1998
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:29,800
But that would be the only

1999
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,600
Type time that the cap will be raised, I wouldn't raise the cap to

2000
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,200
keep the company in business, right?

2001
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:36,100
I want to do that.

2002
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,900
I would raise the cap if the dollar is suddenly worth nothing.

2003
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:45,000
Okay, so it's basically like a fifty dollars in gold cap.

2004
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,200
If that makes like a like a, like a fifty dollars in gold today.

2005
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:51,700
Today's $50, however, much that buys, that gold, that is the cap or

2006
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,500
something like that.

2007
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,400
So that if later, you know, if later it turns out that that's too,

2008
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,400
it's too far off from that, we reserve the right to change the cap to

2009
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,800
whatever fifth whatever that

2010
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,200
Of gold is worth today.

2011
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,600
Something like I don't think that's exactly how I would phrase it but

2012
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:04,000
yes up.

2013
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
So that one Coastline, at least it.

2014
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,400
Put the merchant system back into the somewhere.

2015
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:12,500
Well, gold is completely stupid though because it's not it's just as

2016
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,600
arbitrary as currency.

2017
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,100
So yeah, number of chairs made or something by a particular country

2018
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,600
for a year, might be a better better better index.

2019
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,700
So I'm trying to think if there's other avenues that I'd like to

2020
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:25,300
explore their.

2021
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,200
So I mean, I think so, I think I've gotten most of the things like

2022
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,800
I've gotten most of sort of the

2023
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:36,300
The I guess the Avenues of it which is it sounds like there's there's

2024
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:39,500
some things like for example with the cap, there are some things which

2025
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:44,200
I feel like you could stay up front and actually codify right.

2026
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,300
In other words, we were talking a little bit before you were saying

2027
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:49,500
like if there was some law I could subscribe to that was like don't be

2028
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,100
a dick.

2029
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:50,800
Right?

2030
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,700
I do that.

2031
01:28:51,700 --> 01:28:55,000
So it sounds like maybe there are a few of those things that you could

2032
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
actually do such as stating that there's a cap that cannot be raised

2033
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,600
other the in

2034
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,600
Inflation goes up by a certain amount or something like this.

2035
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,000
There are some things, right?

2036
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,800
You could do if you wanted to, so that wait, no, that's that's one

2037
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,000
that I, that is one that I'm absolutely going to do.

2038
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,300
I don't know what the cap is going to be.

2039
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,300
I'm playing with 50, I don't know what it's actually going to be

2040
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,600
right, and another right, and the other one, and it'll be something

2041
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,200
reasonable.

2042
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:22,000
And I mean 50s, kind of unreasonable, but I do have free to play

2043
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:22,200
works.

2044
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,300
You can't be that low and, you know, that's a downside.

2045
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,100
But what you going to do?

2046
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,900
And then the other one, I don't know what you're going to do is sell

2047
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:29,300
the game.

2048
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:29,800
Look at Norm.

2049
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:30,500
A person.

2050
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,800
So I'm that's why we're having this discussion is like, and again, it

2051
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,200
doesn't bother you that like the cap is $50.

2052
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:42,300
So somehow like 12 months, someone pays $50, 06 06 hundred dollars a

2053
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,700
year for this game and you're like, no, that's fine.

2054
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,200
I mean, yes, it's fine.

2055
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,800
Okay, that's, you know, like that will make the game better for more

2056
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,300
people.

2057
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:55,600
So yes, it's fine.

2058
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,400
But the other thing was all assets.

2059
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,900
Code everything goes into either.

2060
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,200
GPL or public domain.

2061
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,200
Once the server's go off and development stops.

2062
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,700
That's another thing that's like all this is something that can be

2063
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,300
codified.

2064
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,400
Yeah, it's a Sunday in a contract as opposed to just like trust me.

2065
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:10,500
Exactly.

2066
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:10,700
Yeah.

2067
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:16,300
And like anything that we can do to be like this is you know, we're

2068
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:17,900
trying to be as ethical as possible here.

2069
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,300
And I'm only doing this and I seriously like legitimately am only

2070
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,600
reason I'm doing this because I actually think it is the best for the

2071
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,000
game.

2072
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,400
And if we were five years ago, when people were spending money or ten

2073
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,800
years ago, when people were spending money on,

2074
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,600
Subscription games.

2075
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,100
I wouldn't, I wouldn't want to do free to play, even if it made even

2076
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,700
if the, even if it made like astronomically more money, right?

2077
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:36,400
Like, I don't care.

2078
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,700
That's not why I'm doing this, right?

2079
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:39,900
I'm doing it because I'm trying to make the best game possible.

2080
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,500
And I think in this case free-to-play is actually going to deliver

2081
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:42,900
that.

2082
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,100
And so if that's actually true that in the past you would have been

2083
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:50,900
okay with a subscription model, right?

2084
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:51,500
Hmm.

2085
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:55,000
Is there going to be a subscription model that people can elect to

2086
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,400
use?

2087
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,900
Yeah, the $50 a month thing.

2088
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,500
So six hundred dollars a year is the subscription.

2089
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,100
Okay, that's kind of unreasonable.

2090
01:31:03,100 --> 01:31:06,200
Wouldn't you say no?

2091
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:09,400
I mean, unreasonable from what point of view from the point of view,

2092
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:12,000
that whatever the game is that you're developing with the 30 people

2093
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,000
that you have or whatever that you would have sold for $60 a year or

2094
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:16,400
whatever.

2095
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,400
It's not the same game.

2096
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,200
That's the difference though.

2097
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,300
It's not the same game.

2098
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,300
It is sold for the actually the same.

2099
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,200
It is absolutely not the same game.

2100
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,900
If it's sold for $60, we have fewer people playing it.

2101
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,800
If we have fewer people playing it, we don't have the data.

2102
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,400
To make the game as good we have, don't have the data to make the game

2103
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:32,700
as good.

2104
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,000
You're not getting as good of a game.

2105
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,600
It won't be as competitively viable.

2106
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,700
It won't be as good.

2107
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,200
We don't have the money to run the servers to constantly improve

2108
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:42,800
everything we just that money doesn't exist.

2109
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,600
So write your thing.

2110
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,100
But okay, so what you're saying is it's the game is worth ten times

2111
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:48,800
more money.

2112
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:50,300
As a result.

2113
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,400
Yeah, yeah, easily.

2114
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,400
Easily, 10 times, more money.

2115
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,900
It's worth zero.

2116
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:59,100
It's worth infinitely more because without it without a left, people

2117
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,500
playing it to gather data to make the game competitively viable, the

2118
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,600
game is worth zero.

2119
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:07,600
How many people is that 100,000 100,000 people?

2120
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,900
Yeah, so you don't think you could sell a game to 100,000 people.

2121
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:11,500
No.

2122
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:12,800
Okay.

2123
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,000
You know what?

2124
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:14,900
I probably could.

2125
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:18,600
I don't think I'm comfortable enough.

2126
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,500
I don't have the

2127
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:25,300
The okay, personally I just don't have the money to make to pay for a

2128
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,300
game that has to be developed in that way.

2129
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,400
Well, how we're going to develop the game to begin with?

2130
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,100
Then, I mean, how are you going to get this free to pray Revenue to

2131
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:37,800
start coming in without the money, to do The Upfront development, to

2132
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,500
make the game with art and stuff, complicated, involves government

2133
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:48,100
grants and government grants, like, free to play and, or either away.

2134
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:48,500
Yeah.

2135
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,400
And freedom.

2136
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,100
Play.

2137
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:58,800
Allows us to release the game immediately crappy versions like, you

2138
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,800
know, beta Alpha.

2139
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,300
Pre-alpha, like whatever Greek letter you want to associate with it,

2140
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,400
some really awful version of the game.

2141
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:06,600
Like, have you seen my stream?

2142
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,800
Like what I've been working on when I get a triangle flying around?

2143
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,000
Like we could just release that right?

2144
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,300
The triangle flying around?

2145
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,600
Yeah, well there you go, we can release the triangle flying around

2146
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,000
right I think it wasn't flying around yet when I saw it but it was

2147
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:16,400
there.

2148
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,500
Oh well if flies now okay.

2149
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,200
Yeah, it's great.

2150
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,900
So like we can release that now or as soon as we have our dedicated

2151
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,100
server up which should be in the next couple of weeks.

2152
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,900
So like we can release that game and

2153
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,400
And it's available and like, people can start talking about and people

2154
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,700
can start playing it now, right?

2155
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:37,200
And we can slowly bring in free to play stuff.

2156
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,700
Once the game is pretty good, like, I'm not even worried about like

2157
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,900
actually producing Cosmetics or any of that stuff.

2158
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,800
So there's actually like a good game there, right?

2159
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,200
But if we get people playing it now for completely for free under the

2160
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,200
assumption, like we're not hiding.

2161
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,900
The fact that we're doing free to play, we're not hiding what we're

2162
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:52,400
going to do.

2163
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,000
We're being pretty transparent about it.

2164
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:56,200
That's why I'm having this discussion to, right?

2165
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,800
So we're not operating people aren't getting the game.

2166
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,500
The assumption that is going to be free forever for everybody.

2167
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,400
People are if they're going to play the game.

2168
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,300
Now there are operating under the assumption.

2169
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,000
It's going to be free to play at some point so

2170
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:14,200
You know, we couldn't release this game for free and then have people

2171
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,100
like pay $60 for it at some arbitrary time, right?

2172
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:22,000
Where we can roll in free-to-play stuff earlier than we could sell it

2173
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,800
for $60, for example, and use that to fund the development of the

2174
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,200
game.

2175
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,200
I see, well, I mean, there are plenty of examples of that sort of

2176
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,100
thing, though, for like I mean, Prison Architect would be a classic

2177
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,400
example of that, right?

2178
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,400
I don't know how much money I made in Early Access or whatever it was

2179
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,600
1.4 like million units or something.

2180
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,600
Now, if you look at it, it's insane.

2181
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,000
How many?

2182
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
There was some ridiculously huge number.

2183
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,300
Yeah, Nuclear Throne did 110,000 or something.

2184
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,000
Yeah, that it

2185
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,800
Good for them.

2186
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:52,900
I mean, I don't know.

2187
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:56,300
I don't know how, I don't know how to do it well, but again, so I'm

2188
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,700
just asking the question little rhetorically.

2189
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,900
It seems like we do have lots of examples of ways that you actually

2190
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,800
can do that well.

2191
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:03,500
So I don't know that.

2192
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,200
I necessarily believe that somehow the f2p part is that, you know,

2193
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,100
you're saying government grants.

2194
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,800
But like, okay, I mean, if magically, you can get government grants

2195
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,500
then I mean all bets are off.

2196
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,500
It's like if the government comes in and says, everyone has to do

2197
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,800
free-to-play, then, obviously, they win their the government.

2198
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,800
You can't fight the government.

2199
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:19,900
So I'm not going against that, but that's exactly how it works, but

2200
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:20,700
take that out.

2201
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:24,100
The equation for a second and assuming that you have to come up with

2202
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:27,600
this as a viable, business model in general free-to-play doesn't get

2203
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:28,600
an advantage there.

2204
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:32,000
You still have to find the money somewhere the game.

2205
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,500
Yeah, I don't know.

2206
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,800
I think it's, I think it's, I think it being free to play makes

2207
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,800
finding the money easier and I think it makes

2208
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:46,400
I think it makes finding the money easier and then it sort of

2209
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,400
transitions nicely from the hey, we're finding the money to, hey, we

2210
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,900
actually have a game that's, you know, like a production level, you

2211
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,400
know, finished polish game or whatever.

2212
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,000
Like it, there's a transition examples of that because I can point out

2213
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,800
lots of examples of people who did like early,

2214
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,700
Access or kick starters and had various other products.

2215
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:05,700
Do you have an example of some smelling developer that started in f2p

2216
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:09,200
game with a triangle or whatever else and somehow was able to fund

2217
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,400
themselves the whole time till they got a game with some art in it or

2218
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:11,900
whatever?

2219
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,800
No, no, I don't know if any of that, I don't know of any of that

2220
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,300
either.

2221
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:18,500
So why are you saying that?

2222
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:19,900
You think that would be effective?

2223
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,100
Why are you saying?

2224
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,300
You think that would be?

2225
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,400
What makes you think?

2226
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,600
That's bad is going to work at all.

2227
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,600
The government grants.

2228
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,600
What are the what are these?

2229
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,700
Grants say regarding food?

2230
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,300
If I'm very curious about it, nothing not part of the argument, but

2231
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,500
I'm just curious now nothing specifically about like it has to be free

2232
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:39,800
to play.

2233
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,600
But it's like, what's your business model?

2234
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,900
These are the business models that have been accepted in the last

2235
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,100
couple of years, right?

2236
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,600
Like dyad was funded by the by the Ontario government as well.

2237
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,800
But at that time, I don't think I mean free to play against the single

2238
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,000
was around but like it wasn't valued that high.

2239
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,200
But now it's like,

2240
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,700
Free to place pretty big.

2241
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:57,400
Okay?

2242
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,500
And these government programs would not accept.

2243
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,500
We are doing some other thing like what prison architect did or

2244
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:03,800
whatever?

2245
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,500
Well, they could they would accept them.

2246
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:09,300
But it's a question of how much like each site basically.

2247
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:11,000
It's a long one quarter page application.

2248
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,200
Each section of the application gets weighted differently gets about

2249
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,900
applied like a score to it and then those scores are weighted and the

2250
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,300
score for business model or the wait for business models quite high

2251
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,200
and free-to-play scores very high on that.

2252
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,800
That's pretty terrifying.

2253
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:28,200
Shawn.

2254
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,100
Separate from this discussion.

2255
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:30,900
Amen.

2256
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Canada terrifying.

2257
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:32,800
Welcome.

2258
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:33,500
Welcome to Canada.

2259
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:35,700
It's my turn to rag on your country.

2260
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,500
That is a really stupid.

2261
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:41,100
Just did you see our new prime minister?

2262
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,000
No, it's pretty good-looking.

2263
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,600
Oh, really?

2264
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:45,100
Oh yeah, he's a hottie.

2265
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,400
Okay good.

2266
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,000
We elect actors here.

2267
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So there's no reason you can't go for cosmetics and there you go.

2268
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,600
If we can elect Ronald Reagan, you can Arete like to ever you want.

2269
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,900
I feel like, yeah.

2270
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:57,000
All right.

2271
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,200
Well I think I don't feel like I have any other specific things that I

2272
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,500
want to ask about.

2273
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,300
I mean, I feel like again, I haven't.

2274
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,700
I certainly haven't heard anything that would make me less nervous

2275
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:09,700
about it as a business model.

2276
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,100
Because as far as I could tell, most of the things I was concerned

2277
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,600
about wasn't that you weren't concerned about them is that you're just

2278
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:18,700
like, I'm not going to do them right that kept being kind of the

2279
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:21,000
answer was like, I'm not going to do.

2280
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:24,100
I'm not going to spend my time, trying to figure out how to get people

2281
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:24,900
to buy Cosmetics.

2282
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,200
I'm just I'm just not

2283
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,100
And so the fact that, you know, you may be worried that all the

2284
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:33,100
incentives are for me to spend my time figuring how to make this game

2285
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,100
be a game where people want to buy Cosmetics.

2286
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,100
I'm just not good, do it, right?

2287
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:37,800
Well, that's not true.

2288
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,800
I'm going to do some of that like I said like I'm not gonna do it to

2289
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,700
its detriment.

2290
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:43,700
Oh no, I'm no.

2291
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,100
No, of course or whatever right.

2292
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,700
So that so I guess I was thinking for is like I don't feel like I've

2293
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,300
been a suede very much because it sounded like the entirety of the

2294
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,900
argument that the FTP is not going to be a problem here.

2295
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:56,300
All, boiled down to, I'm not going to do the bad stuff, right?

2296
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,400
Right, well no, I don't think so.

2297
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,800
I don't think that's true.

2298
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,200
Because my other one of the arguments and I was making is that free to

2299
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:03,700
play.

2300
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,800
Is actually the best solution and I was talking about getting the

2301
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:15,700
large number of people to play it and lining up payment with

2302
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,700
development, right?

2303
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:19,200
But again, that's about why you think it's going to be a good model

2304
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:19,700
for this game?

2305
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,700
What I'm saying is that the concerns I have about free-to-play?

2306
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,500
We're not assuaged in any way?

2307
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,500
Other than trust me.

2308
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,700
I won't do the things you're worried about.

2309
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,100
Okay.

2310
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,300
Well, what about this though?

2311
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,500
Okay, you could say.

2312
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:45,000
That the business model choice for particular game is, how do I phrase

2313
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,500
this?

2314
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,700
The business model choice for particular game, it can be a wide

2315
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:54,900
variety of things and all of them have a direct impact on the quality

2316
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,800
of the game, or a different way of putting it, as they have a direct

2317
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:03,300
impact on the quality of the experience that the average game player

2318
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,800
will have right, you buy a game up front.

2319
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,400
We get this experience, right?

2320
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,000
You you're going to get this experience, it has some quality value

2321
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,900
associated with it.

2322
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:15,000
You you pay a subscription model and you're going to have this

2323
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,300
experience and it has a quality value associated with the same with

2324
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,200
free-to-play, right?

2325
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,400
I think in this situation A my situation free to play

2326
01:40:22,700 --> 01:40:30,600
Delivers the best quality experience to the average player, and not

2327
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,100
just like the median player, but like 22 like across the whole

2328
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:34,600
Spectrum.

2329
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,300
It's the best for everybody, except for, I guess the people are

2330
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:43,200
spending $600 a year or whatever, but for the vast majority of players

2331
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,300
free-to-play is going to produce a better experience for them.

2332
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:50,800
So in that regard, I think that's pretty unique.

2333
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,100
Amongst free to play games.

2334
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:52,300
I don't

2335
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:55,200
I think that's necessarily the case anywhere except for perhaps DOTA.

2336
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:57,900
Well, hold on a second, though.

2337
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:04,200
Again, that is really has nothing to do with if someone comes to this

2338
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:08,600
and goes, I find when I play all this f2p stuff, it's really annoying.

2339
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,200
It's always trying to trick me into buy something.

2340
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:12,800
It's giving me the Christmas crate that I have to pay a dollar to

2341
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,300
unlock.

2342
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:17,900
Its they've got economists who are trying to figure out how to sell me

2343
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,600
the most number of goods that look like they're coming to it with all

2344
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,200
of the concerns because they've played all these

2345
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,300
You to play games and legitimately.

2346
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,400
They have seen a lot of stuff about these games if they don't like

2347
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:28,000
right?

2348
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,600
Yeah, they're coming to you and they're saying those are my concerns.

2349
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:36,200
And your answer is not that don't worry about it because, you know, we

2350
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:40,200
have these ways in which we know it won't happen, you're just saying

2351
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:41,700
we won't do those things to you.

2352
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,200
Well, I've given you two things that are the cap, right?

2353
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:50,200
At $50 a month is six hundred dollars a year which is like not that

2354
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:50,700
much of a cat.

2355
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,200
But okay, well, we have it.

2356
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,500
I said it's 50 but but you even said the phrase to that you can't go

2357
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:58,300
very low because quote unquote you know, how free to play games work

2358
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:58,900
and it can't go.

2359
01:41:58,900 --> 01:41:59,500
That low.

2360
01:41:59,600 --> 01:41:59,800
I can't

2361
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,300
Right, so you raised fish, probably 50 bucks.

2362
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:05,100
You're already saying it looks like a nasty distribution where a bunch

2363
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,700
of people carry all the weight in a bunch of people don't or whatever

2364
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:08,400
and that's okay.

2365
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:08,900
Whatever.

2366
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:11,000
But point being, we've established that part.

2367
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:11,200
Uh-huh.

2368
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,800
And there really wasn't anything else.

2369
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,000
There was the fact that you won't shut down the servers without

2370
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,200
releasing the source code, but that doesn't affect what happens, while

2371
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,200
the games actually commercial.

2372
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:21,900
Right?

2373
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,400
So, what was, what were the other things that were supposed to make me

2374
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:25,800
believe?

2375
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,100
Well, no, it was Christopher with all over the place and everything

2376
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:28,500
else.

2377
01:42:28,900 --> 01:42:29,900
The fact that I

2378
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I mean the fact that I did say that I would like to codify something,

2379
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,600
we're either percentages of development or things like that but

2380
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,100
you're, you know, you're absolutely right.

2381
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,600
And that I think what it comes down to what you're saying is, is it

2382
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:46,100
creates a massive power imbalance between the consumer and the

2383
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,300
developer, right?

2384
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:52,100
Like, the person who's paying the money has very little power in what

2385
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,100
happens with the thing that they're paying for.

2386
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:54,600
Right?

2387
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,400
So, you're paying $10 a month or whatever.

2388
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,900
Well, it's also adversarial, I guess is the other

2389
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,900
Meeting you in order for you to survive you must convince me to spend

2390
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:05,800
money on the game.

2391
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,500
That's just a basic tenet of how this is going to go.

2392
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,000
So you know what, you see when you look at these other companies is

2393
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,200
that they do exactly that.

2394
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,600
Like, that's what zynga's all about.

2395
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,400
They're like trying to figure out every possible way to manipulate me

2396
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:19,200
into paying this money.

2397
01:43:19,200 --> 01:43:19,900
Right?

2398
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,200
And, you know, when I come to your game it's like why how do I know

2399
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:25,600
that you're not going to go down that route?

2400
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,700
And I guess what I'm saying is I haven't heard anything other than,

2401
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:29,500
trust me.

2402
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:29,800
I'm a nice.

2403
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,300
Guy which means right?

2404
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,100
Ooh, but it doesn't really help.

2405
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,200
Actually, anyone who doesn't necessarily know who you are, or doesn't

2406
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:39,300
necessarily know who your business partners are, or what will happen,

2407
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:39,800
right?

2408
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:40,800
No, you're absolutely right.

2409
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,300
And and I don't know what the solution to that is.

2410
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:48,100
If you know if you want to help me come up with one or if you can come

2411
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:49,900
up with one, I'd fucking love to hear it, right?

2412
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,600
But that isn't something that I think.

2413
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,300
I can tackle right like, I can't tackle the hey we're going to fix

2414
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:02,800
free-to-play across the board and make it an ethical business model.

2415
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,300
Right?

2416
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,000
That I don't know.

2417
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:12,800
I don't have a solution to but what I do have a solution to I think is

2418
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:18,700
that free-to-play can be applied pragmatically to a situation that

2419
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:23,400
benefits everybody and it actually becomes the best option.

2420
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,300
Not

2421
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:28,000
The option that were using because we're trying to exploit people and

2422
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,800
make a lot of money.

2423
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:35,400
I think actually can be the best option for making a particular type

2424
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:35,800
of game.

2425
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:39,500
This, this probably is the only type word ongoing competitive blah,

2426
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:40,000
blah, blah.

2427
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:45,300
So, my only argument my argument isn't that free-to-play is great.

2428
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,200
Everybody should do it.

2429
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:47,300
That's not what I'm saying.

2430
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,600
What I'm saying is that free-to-play is awful.

2431
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:50,600
However,

2432
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,100
In this one isolated situation or maybe there's others that I haven't

2433
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:58,200
thought of but in this particular isolated situation free-to-play

2434
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,800
serves the game.

2435
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,600
The players and the developers better than any other business model.

2436
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:05,800
Right.

2437
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:12,300
And so again, that's true of most of the Esports free-to-play things,

2438
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:15,400
correct, meaning, that is the same statement you would make about

2439
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:15,800
them.

2440
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:20,600
It's just that they didn't choose to optionally be ethical when they

2441
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,800
applied it, but all the things you're saying right?

2442
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,200
You know, words League of Legends.

2443
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,700
What you just said, applies that if what you're saying is correct,

2444
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:30,400
that free to play as the best model for these types of games.

2445
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,900
Then they chose the best model, right?

2446
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:33,800
No that's not.

2447
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,900
I'm not saying that if your places

2448
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,100
For these type of games I'm saying the free-to-play is the best model

2449
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:43,500
for my particular goals which is to make a competitively viable high

2450
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:47,400
quality game that has lots of people playing it in order to get

2451
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,500
competitive viability.

2452
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:49,500
That's what I'm saying.

2453
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:51,500
That's not Riot School.

2454
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:56,500
Okay, so for the goal, it's not about the type of game, it's just a

2455
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,400
goal, it's the goal, but the type of like the goal implies a certain

2456
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,600
type of gamer like has to have an online has a server as matchmaking,

2457
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:05,200
yellow blah, blah blah, right?

2458
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:07,600
It has to have all of those features and has to have ongoing

2459
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,600
development with, you know, Gathering tons of statistics about item

2460
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,900
combinations and hero combinations and blah blah blah.

2461
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,900
In order to figure out what is balanced and what is in balance and how

2462
01:46:16,900 --> 01:46:20,000
to balance it and all that sort of stuff, all of that stuff is

2463
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,900
required to make.

2464
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:27,600
The best most competitive possible Team game, which is what my goal

2465
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:27,900
is.

2466
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:31,700
So for that goal, I think free-to-play serves at best and that's not

2467
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:32,400
right, it's cool.

2468
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:38,500
Okay, so what's the difference between you and Riot, Carlos?

2469
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:39,500
Right?

2470
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,800
Which gets me exactly back to what I'm saying.

2471
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,000
So, that's a pretty significant difference.

2472
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,600
No, it's all just about what your motivation is, right?

2473
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,800
And whether or not you're going to be ethical as a person, it has

2474
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,100
nothing to do with the game.

2475
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:54,100
Self is the same kind of game, right?

2476
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,000
It's the same kind of game, same kind of business model.

2477
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,100
Everything else is the same.

2478
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:01,700
All you're saying is, I won't do what right does trust me, right?

2479
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,700
No, I'm saying I won't do it right, it does.

2480
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:08,100
Because that's not even, like, that's not a, that's not a goal, like,

2481
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,700
that's not apply its doing this.

2482
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:12,000
That's what ethics are golden ethics?

2483
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:12,900
There's no difference.

2484
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:16,400
What you're trying to do is your ethics, that's the definition of what

2485
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,100
it is, right?

2486
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:18,500
It's like okay, right?

2487
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:21,200
Okay, you know, I mean there's no just because you're calling it a

2488
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:22,200
goal, it doesn't.

2489
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:22,900
Make it any different.

2490
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:25,400
It's still a thing in your head that you're telling us to trust you

2491
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,300
about, right?

2492
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,000
Oh, I do think that there's definitely the element of.

2493
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,900
Hey, I know everything is evil, but trust me.

2494
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:31,600
I'm not evil.

2495
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,300
There is definitely that and I don't know what I can do to get around

2496
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:34,600
that.

2497
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:39,600
But what I'm saying is that, I'm not starting from the position where

2498
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,000
Riot or Zynga or whoever else is starting from, right?

2499
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,300
Like those, making a whole bunch of money is 0.

2500
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,700
I have zero interest in that, right?

2501
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:50,000
Like that's not even like 10 gently a goal.

2502
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,100
That's like, I don't even care.

2503
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,500
Yeah, so that's not why I'm doing it.

2504
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,300
I'm doing it.

2505
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,400
You know, if it's altruistic reasons or whatever it's not, it's

2506
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,300
Nicole reasons, right?

2507
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,300
I want to do free to play for practical reasons.

2508
01:48:03,300 --> 01:48:06,500
I think it's I think it is the actual best model in this situation and

2509
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:10,700
if you think that that if you just say well because your goal is

2510
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,200
different.

2511
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:15,900
And what you want to do is different that's irrelevant and it still

2512
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,300
boils down to trust me, which I guess is what your argument is.

2513
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:19,900
Is that true?

2514
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,200
Well, my argument is a little more specific than that, right?

2515
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:28,100
Because in general, you know, since we're trying to talk about a

2516
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,800
business model as

2517
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,900
As the core, you know, gravamen of the argument, right?

2518
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:37,500
It's like the thing we're talking about is the business model, not

2519
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:37,800
Sean.

2520
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,200
McGrath like if the argument was, is Sean McGrath a good person or

2521
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:44,800
not, then I agree that all of these things are relevant because that's

2522
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:45,800
what we're actually talking about.

2523
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,900
But in this case, we're talking about specifically, the business model

2524
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,700
and what the hazards of that business model are to a developer, right?

2525
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,200
Okay, and won the argument that I again, keep coming back to that.

2526
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:59,800
I think you seem to be consistently

2527
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,300
Getting is that you're saying that those hazards aren't a problem

2528
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:06,700
because you won't fall prey to them, right?

2529
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:07,400
And I guess what?

2530
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:10,200
I keep trying to just make sure that we have solidified is the fact

2531
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:12,200
that that is actually where we're Landing meaning.

2532
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:16,200
We're not trying to say that these hazards aren't still all there for

2533
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:18,800
your game because they all are, it's okay.

2534
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:20,500
You don't think you will fall prey to them.

2535
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,800
Yeah, I think that they're all there.

2536
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:24,300
Yes, that no, that makes perfect sense.

2537
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,000
And I think that that's a fair assessment, and I'm not saying that I'm

2538
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,200
not going to fall prey to them.

2539
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:28,800
I'm going to say that.

2540
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:29,800
I'm gonna try really hard not to

2541
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:33,600
To write but like anything that can be done up front to be like this

2542
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,600
the these this is the framework in which I'm operating and I can't

2543
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,500
overstep.

2544
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,700
Like if there's like a legal thing that I could be like this is what

2545
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,100
I'm willing to do and anything outside of this is off the table

2546
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:44,600
completely.

2547
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,300
I'd be I'm totally willing to do that.

2548
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:49,000
I totally would like to do that and if I can come up with a way of

2549
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,600
doing that, so that other developers could also do it.

2550
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:55,600
That would be good because I don't think free to play.

2551
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,500
Is bad inherently.

2552
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:02,400
I think every implementation of it is bad in the fact that there's the

2553
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,600
power imbalance or whatever.

2554
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:09,400
All that shit is bad but the actual idea that the game is free and

2555
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:12,500
some people have the option to pay for it that like just that little

2556
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,800
fundamental nugget there, I think is fine.

2557
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,500
It's just everything that's surrounding it.

2558
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:20,900
Everything that's like bread branched off of that little tiny idea has

2559
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:26,000
been awful and entirely driven by entirely by Financial motivations,

2560
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:26,300
right?

2561
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:26,700
And I

2562
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:34,100
Don't think that it has to be but I don't have a concrete solution to

2563
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,500
that problem.

2564
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,000
Like I'm not saying this is how we're not going to do that, right?

2565
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,900
Like I don't have that because there's so many ways in which you could

2566
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,600
be enticed to just be evil, right?

2567
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:47,200
And I don't have a solution for all of them and part of it is.

2568
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,600
Yeah, just trust me but anything that I can do to be like, hey you

2569
01:50:51,600 --> 01:50:54,300
don't have to just trust me, there is like a thing that I'm signing

2570
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:54,900
here or whatever.

2571
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:56,600
It says, I will only operate Within These parameters.

2572
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:59,500
L, I think that would be really positive thing and I'd be totally

2573
01:50:59,500 --> 01:50:59,900
totally.

2574
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,400
Why I totally want to do that, right?

2575
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:07,000
Because I do want to do this for you to play in order to best serve,

2576
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,500
the people playing the game and that's sort of my point of view.

2577
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:15,500
Well, let me throw out some options for you then George what you think

2578
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:16,600
of them that's here.

2579
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:20,300
So, if you really want to do this altruistic Ali, right?

2580
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,700
One could imagine that you have some budget for this game.

2581
01:51:23,700 --> 01:51:26,700
That is what you think the development costs are from year to year,

2582
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:27,400
right?

2583
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,800
Where you're basically saying that like you know, we need to run the

2584
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,700
Servers and that's going to cost X dollars per user or something.

2585
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:33,900
You know?

2586
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:37,000
Probably it's more difficult calculation than that but we have some

2587
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,800
appears like to support this many users in this many countries.

2588
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,100
We know it's going to cost this much money.

2589
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:45,300
We want this many artists working on the game, you know, optimally for

2590
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,300
the stuff that we want to roll out, you know, blah, blah blah separate

2591
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:49,000
from free-to-play.

2592
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:52,200
So, meaning, assuming that the game was just going to be purchased

2593
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,100
flat or the Canadian government was going to come in with some crazy

2594
01:51:56,100 --> 01:51:59,700
grant called the Sean McGrath support Grant which just pays for you

2595
01:51:59,700 --> 01:51:59,800
too.

2596
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,400
The game right?

2597
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:02,200
Call him up and tell him.

2598
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:02,800
We want that.

2599
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,100
Yeah, I Would.

2600
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,100
By the way also like the case Amira Tori.

2601
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:09,800
I'm not Canadian but I'd be willing to be for this grant grant, right?

2602
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:14,000
That would you could you could probably get it but so

2603
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:21,900
What about a system that worked a little bit more like say Wikipedia,

2604
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:22,500
right?

2605
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:27,200
Where it's like, okay, the game will be free to play in a year where

2606
01:52:27,200 --> 01:52:31,100
we did not raise the target amount, the previous year.

2607
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:43,400
So you're saying if your players give you enough money through women's

2608
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:47,200
went through just like whatever you want, it could either be if it's

2609
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,700
if it's free to play that year where they're buying stuff, if they buy

2610
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:53,700
enough stuff to pay the next year's budget, it just completely the

2611
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,600
next year, you know, it completely unlocks for everybody or something

2612
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:59,400
this or it's just, there's a donation drive.

2613
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,000
And if the donation Drive hits the development cost, they don't do

2614
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,900
free to play Penny Arcade District did this, for example, for ad, free

2615
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:06,600
for their site.

2616
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:11,900
In fact, valve does something like this sort of, with the compendium,

2617
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:14,400
except they still just try to make as much money on everything else is

2618
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,100
that can too.

2619
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,700
But, no, they make so much money off that compendium.

2620
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:18,300
It's ridiculous.

2621
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,900
So, in other words, imagine something like the compendium where every

2622
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,000
year, you have a compendium.

2623
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:26,500
And if enough people buy it to pay for whatever is the set Development

2624
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:26,800
Goal.

2625
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,700
So your company profit that you feel is ethical amount to make plus

2626
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:32,800
your development costs.

2627
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:37,000
Then the next year doesn't have the freedom, everyone just gets the

2628
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:37,700
whole game.

2629
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,100
Well, that's intriguing.

2630
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,100
Okay?

2631
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:44,000
So let's see.

2632
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,500
Why is that, why is that good?

2633
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,000
Why is that bad?

2634
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,500
I mean I'd have to think about it for a while that seems like good on

2635
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,100
the surface, right?

2636
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,600
Like it doesn't seem like there's anything wrong with that.

2637
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,900
One problem with it is it only covers one year, right?

2638
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,700
And you have to think a little bit more long term for things like

2639
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:57,400
this, so, you know, we could have some contingency built into that

2640
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,600
where we have to go 30% over or something like that.

2641
01:53:59,600 --> 01:53:59,900
So that

2642
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,800
And we can get something like that would probably have to be done.

2643
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,300
Let's see.

2644
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:08,900
OK, another problem is

2645
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,200
Let's say let's just I'm just throwing this out as an idea as why it

2646
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:15,800
might not be good.

2647
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:20,400
Let's say we have 12 artists on staff we actually need seven to do the

2648
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,100
game content.

2649
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:21,600
Right?

2650
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,900
What do we do with each other five?

2651
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:23,000
Right?

2652
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:23,700
Do we do?

2653
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:27,700
We do we fire them because with they're not their only needed for

2654
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:30,900
free-to-play stuff and then do we have to bring them back a year a

2655
01:54:30,900 --> 01:54:31,800
year later?

2656
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,000
If we don't make it for the next year, right?

2657
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,600
Like there's there's kind of a staffing Logistics issue, don't think

2658
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,300
that you'd be paying for all of those.

2659
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:43,300
In other words, you have the team that you have and you're going to

2660
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:43,500
know.

2661
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,600
We don't we don't need them.

2662
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:44,900
All.

2663
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,000
No, it's not need there in the budget.

2664
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,900
Meaning, if you do, the, if the compendium thing succeeds in a given

2665
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:54,000
year, then that next year, that whole team is still doing all the

2666
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:54,300
other stuff.

2667
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:56,600
They're still making the free-to-play items, just everyone gets them.

2668
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:58,200
Oh I see.

2669
01:54:58,300 --> 01:54:58,700
So we do it.

2670
01:54:58,700 --> 01:54:59,900
It's there's no difference to you.

2671
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,100
You're running exactly the same way.

2672
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:08,700
It's just a total cap on the on the the sort of the that it's time to

2673
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:11,300
cap really because people can keep giving you money, they can keep

2674
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,700
buying the company and they just want to give you money, right?

2675
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:16,600
Yeah, but it's basically like, it's a bar, that's like, if you go

2676
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:23,400
above this, we won't try to do anymore selling you stuff for the

2677
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,600
period of time that that compendium covers shit.

2678
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,300
Why not just take a little further, why not?

2679
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:31,400
Just say it's free to play up until we beat some amount of money.

2680
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:34,400
Maybe that happens in February or second month of the year or

2681
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:34,700
whatever.

2682
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:36,300
And then after that, everything's just free for everybody.

2683
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:36,500
Yeah.

2684
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:37,300
Why not just do that.

2685
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,300
I don't know why not.

2686
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,500
I don't know, that's a good idea.

2687
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:46,900
We should just do that because lack and I mean, I don't know, I'd have

2688
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,300
to I realized I'd have to think about it, right?

2689
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:50,800
Like I'm sure there's some downsides to it but like that sounds like a

2690
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:54,100
fantastic idea because it seems like that also helps mitigate some of

2691
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:57,000
these problems because then it's like you're not in a position where

2692
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:57,300
you're

2693
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:00,300
talking about how to always grow and how to always make more money.

2694
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:03,000
You're just like, we know what we want to do with the game this year,

2695
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,700
we'd like to focus on development.

2696
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:06,800
If our fans, let us do that we do.

2697
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,700
And we won't be thinking about, you know, how do we do all these other

2698
01:56:10,700 --> 01:56:12,700
things if they don't then all right.

2699
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:17,200
Like, you know, we're back in the kind of f2p nastiness that's just

2700
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:17,500
where we.

2701
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:21,500
So why I really like this idea is because it actually does all the

2702
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:23,700
good things the free-to-play does with all the things that I talked

2703
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:25,700
about and makes it even better, right?

2704
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:27,300
It's even better because now it's

2705
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:29,700
Okay, and now you don't even have to buy anything now.

2706
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:31,600
It's like you don't have to do anything.

2707
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:34,300
Like you just have absolutely everything for free.

2708
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:40,800
Nothing is segregated at all and there's no pops anywhere, but buying

2709
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,100
shit like it's just completely.

2710
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:42,800
Like, I like it.

2711
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,800
I like this idea a lot.

2712
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:44,300
Yeah.

2713
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,600
Okay, I'll probably do this.

2714
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:49,400
Okay, well honestly, that we can still free to play though.

2715
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:55,000
Yeah, that probably would go a long way towards my sort of comfort

2716
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,200
level with the game because then to me,

2717
01:56:57,300 --> 01:56:59,800
me that puts in sort of like I said,

2718
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,100
Little more codification of the of the trust me.

2719
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:09,200
I actually want to develop the game, not the free-to-play because now

2720
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,400
you're telling me up front.

2721
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:12,600
That if as fans we pay you the money.

2722
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,000
You actually wanted.

2723
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:16,700
You'll just work on the game and you won't care about this other

2724
01:57:16,700 --> 01:57:17,200
stuff.

2725
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,100
And that gives me the option as a customer to potentially get what I

2726
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,900
actually want, which is, you just working on the game and not, oh,

2727
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:26,900
yeah, I would totally prefer that too so that gives them that option.

2728
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,400
And so, that's that to me, is a, is a pretty big.

2729
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:29,800
That's a

2730
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,200
Pretty big positive to me if you come out and you do something like

2731
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:32,600
that.

2732
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:36,200
Yeah I would totally do that now there's it would have to be a little

2733
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:38,700
bit more involved in what you're saying right like because like I said

2734
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:42,100
there's the contingency of run devils in the details and there but

2735
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:44,800
there's also like we want to expand to do another game or whatever and

2736
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,900
you know part of the money has to

2737
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:47,700
Whatever, right?

2738
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:50,100
There's going to be some details to it but like having that Kapoor,

2739
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,300
it's like hey if we go over 10 million or 20 million or whatever

2740
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:55,800
development budget is, whatever number we set and I mean, it could be

2741
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,700
arbitrary and it can be stupidly high for.

2742
01:57:57,800 --> 01:57:59,800
We could still be evil in that regard to, right?

2743
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:01,700
But let's say we're not thanks.

2744
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,700
Now we have one point of not being evil, right, where we have like a

2745
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:07,400
clear like, hey, you know, difference between 10 million and 100

2746
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,900
million dollars is pretty obvious to people, right?

2747
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:13,100
So we've been like, okay, whatever our cap is it's 10 million dollars

2748
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:13,600
or whatever.

2749
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:16,100
We say, if you hit this cap, everything is just free for the rest of

2750
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:16,500
the year.

2751
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,500
Yeah, I have the absolute no problem doing that.

2752
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:22,300
Well, that's a fantastic idea that seems like a pretty positive thing

2753
01:58:22,300 --> 01:58:26,800
to me because again, that that's sort of, I guess what, I'm look at

2754
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:31,600
the two problems that I see with what you're talking about from a.

2755
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:35,300
I'm now thinking as a selfish perspective instead of me thinking about

2756
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:38,900
is like, I'm arguing fup for people in general trying to bring up

2757
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:41,600
points that maybe they would make which is what I was doing before.

2758
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,100
Think of it, the self-expression, let's say, I actually want to play

2759
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,600
this game so for some reason I get into Esports so

2760
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,000
I said before, I don't care about Esports.

2761
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,900
I just wake up one day and I'm like, I need Esports of my life and

2762
01:58:50,900 --> 01:58:52,400
would be these ports in your life by the way.

2763
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:53,800
And I want to play a game, right?

2764
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:56,000
Or your game is one of the games I considering, right?

2765
01:58:56,300 --> 01:58:56,600
Sure.

2766
01:58:57,500 --> 01:59:00,400
When I look at that, there's two things that bother me one.

2767
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,200
Is that thing was like, I want the game like I want to play.

2768
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,600
I want to know that somebody made a game and I'm getting the game.

2769
01:59:05,600 --> 01:59:10,700
I don't want to get, you know, this weird shape of the game which is

2770
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:13,900
like, it didn't have the hats and I don't have the weird, you know.

2771
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:14,700
I just want the game.

2772
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:16,600
Yeah, I want you to make a man, what have a game, right?

2773
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,600
Want to get a store with a game inside of I just want the game, right?

2774
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:22,600
And so that's that alleviates that going to like, okay, if we're

2775
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,400
paying this developer enough money they'll just give us the game.

2776
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:26,200
I like that.

2777
01:59:26,300 --> 01:59:26,400
Right.

2778
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:27,000
That's good.

2779
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:27,600
Sure.

2780
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:28,200
I liked that too.

2781
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:32,900
The thing I don't like is there is no way really for me to pay a fair

2782
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:36,500
price for the whole game because like you said that's going to end up

2783
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:38,600
being six hundred dollars a year which is pretty darn high.

2784
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:45,100
So if me if our if as fans we don't hit your cap and individual can't

2785
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:46,600
really Rectify their situation

2786
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:49,800
At a fair price, which I don't see much of a way around that.

2787
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,400
Because like you said, the whole point of this model is that, it's

2788
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:56,100
lopsided, so it kind of falls apart, if you say oh, I'll just charge

2789
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,400
you what the fair market value would have been at that thing.

2790
01:59:58,900 --> 01:59:59,400
It doesn't weigh.

2791
01:59:59,400 --> 01:59:59,800
You can't.

2792
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,700
Do that, right?

2793
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:03,600
But like, but my point is that you're getting its you're getting a

2794
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:04,600
different game, right?

2795
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:07,500
Like if you do that, you have fewer people playing it, you have less

2796
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:08,300
data, you have less.

2797
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:09,600
It's a different game, right?

2798
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,700
You're not the to you're not getting the same game so don't think it's

2799
02:00:11,700 --> 02:00:12,300
fair to compare them.

2800
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,400
Well I'm not saying it's fair to compare them or not.

2801
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:18,500
It's just saying as a person I can't pay what anyone would ever

2802
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:21,400
consider a fair price for a game because the game is like 60 70 bucks

2803
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:25,400
or something like this and actually get the game that was made for the

2804
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,700
same development budget.

2805
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:29,600
By the way, that would have gone into say Call of Duty.

2806
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:29,900
Which I

2807
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
I can buy for $60, right?

2808
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,200
So it's I'm just saying that, like, from that perspective, it doesn't,

2809
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:40,800
there's no way to turn it on an individual basis into the, I just

2810
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,200
bought the game version, but no, I don't think there is.

2811
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:44,800
And so around the park, we do that.

2812
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,800
We don't The Upfront development.

2813
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:47,600
Yeah, there's no way to do it at least.

2814
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:50,100
If I least, I can't think of it, the other had a hundred million

2815
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:50,500
dollars.

2816
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:52,900
Like try Eric, what's the company that makes?

2817
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:53,700
Yeah, Treyarch.

2818
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:55,400
Well, there's actually, do they have multiple Studios?

2819
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,300
I think they alternate for Call of Duty, right?

2820
02:00:57,300 --> 02:00:59,600
I think they stopped because it was Infinity Ward and Treyarch.

2821
02:00:59,600 --> 02:00:59,800
And then

2822
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:00,900
I think it's just Treyarch.

2823
02:01:00,900 --> 02:01:01,800
And I don't know, whatever.

2824
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:03,600
Either way, I don't have their development.

2825
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,300
No, nobody does, right?

2826
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,400
So we can't, that's not even an option, right?

2827
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:12,300
Well, okay, I think I might, I think I might be done.

2828
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:13,300
I think, I think that's it.

2829
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:16,000
I think I said everything I had to say, I feel like what you would

2830
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,900
play this game under, the, under that condition.

2831
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:23,900
So, I think what I would say is, I don't know how to alleviate one

2832
02:01:23,900 --> 02:01:27,200
problematic piece, which is that

2833
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:33,700
That cap could be set unreasonably high.

2834
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:36,300
So, as to ensure that it basically never happened, right?

2835
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:39,900
And I don't know how you fix that, really right?

2836
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:43,100
Because I mean, you could try to put something up front, that sort of

2837
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,500
like your peg to the price of gold thing.

2838
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:48,800
We were talking about before, where you're like, oh the cap is $50 in

2839
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,600
this Peg to inflation.

2840
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,400
Something one could imagine that like, oh, the cap.

2841
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:55,200
Every year for the global cap is set to 10 million dollars to

2842
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,200
inflation or you know, you had something I could maybe see that but

2843
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:58,800
even so it's

2844
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:00,000
Still very hard.

2845
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,700
I don't, I don't know that one.

2846
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,600
So there is kind of a little nasty loophole where it's like, well the

2847
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,000
developer could always still decide in any given year to just

2848
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,100
basically screw me as a customer if they wanted to, and I don't know

2849
02:02:11,100 --> 02:02:14,900
the way around that but in general, assuming that, that price was set

2850
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:18,500
fairly and was set to a reasonable development budget plus profit.

2851
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:20,600
Yeah, I think I could be okay with that.

2852
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:26,400
And, you know, if that if that were the model, I think I would

2853
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:28,700
certainly, I could at very least say I'd be much more, okay.

2854
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:30,000
With that than FTP.

2855
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:32,600
Yeah, I would totally right.

2856
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,900
I think it's a great idea like it wasn't because it doesn't

2857
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:40,300
It doesn't hurt any of the things that I want to do, right?

2858
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:41,100
Like it.

2859
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:42,900
I still get to do everything that I want to do.

2860
02:02:43,600 --> 02:02:46,700
I don't get to make a stupid ridiculous amount of money but I'd wanted

2861
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:47,400
that anyway, right.

2862
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:52,300
So it's like this seems to be at least, you know for the 10 minutes

2863
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,300
that I've heard of this idea.

2864
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:56,800
This seems to this the seems to be reasonably you know as soon as her

2865
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,100
it seems reasonable seems like a good place to start at least.

2866
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,800
And I don't see a problem with that.

2867
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:04,500
Like I think that's probably a good idea.

2868
02:03:05,200 --> 02:03:06,400
Well yeah, then that's pretty cool.

2869
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,800
Because again, like I said, from a selfish perspective, one of the

2870
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,200
things that I mostly am concerned about is I want to be able to just

2871
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:15,700
buy the game and I also want a way to free the developer from having

2872
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:19,100
to think about this aspect of it and I'd love to not have to think

2873
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:19,800
about it yet.

2874
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:23,500
And so I feel like that is the part where the progress can be made.

2875
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:29,400
If you can move away from a free-to-play, is the fallback for the

2876
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:29,800
business.

2877
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:30,400
Model.

2878
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:34,100
There's a big difference between that and free-to-play is the business

2879
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:34,600
model?

2880
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,000
Well, what do you think?

2881
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:39,700
But do you think it's a fallback, like compendium type thing or do you

2882
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:40,400
think it's?

2883
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:44,400
Hey, it's just free to play until we hit as much money as we need at

2884
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:44,700
that point.

2885
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:45,400
Everything is free.

2886
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:46,600
What?

2887
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:49,800
Like we don't, we don't have a special event, like, compendium or

2888
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:50,100
whatever.

2889
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:52,200
It's just January, 1st rolls around.

2890
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:55,200
It's free to play until we make 10 million dollars or whatever it is.

2891
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:58,000
So, here's what I would probably say and I'd have to think about this

2892
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,900
a little more because I came up with us, this idea.

2893
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,400
Literally just, as we were talking, it wasn't like I had time to think

2894
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:07,900
about it either, but what I would probably say is again as a player, I

2895
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:12,100
want to buy what I want from you is I want not free to play.

2896
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:15,100
I want to pay you $60 and get my game.

2897
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:17,100
That's what I wanted, right?

2898
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:21,000
So what I would suggest is, how do you make this system into something

2899
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,300
that looks a lot like that.

2900
02:04:22,300 --> 02:04:26,200
Meaning at the beginning of the year, if all of us can go and just

2901
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:29,200
say, okay, you said something, you said like twenty four dollars a

2902
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:29,800
year was what you wanted.

2903
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:32,200
Wanted to make from us or something, right?

2904
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:32,800
Yeah.

2905
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:39,400
If everyone paid, whatever the amount is to get up to that number,

2906
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,100
right?

2907
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:41,300
Then the game is free.

2908
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:44,500
So maybe there's something like, okay, there's just like a

2909
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:48,000
contribution thing or you at the beginning of the year, there's the

2910
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
thing you can buy which is like I'm trying to get us towards this goal

2911
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,800
or maybe you get a little badge, if you spend over the amount that

2912
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,300
you're supposed to something that's like designed to allow everyone to

2913
02:04:59,300 --> 02:04:59,800
come together.

2914
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,900
Our and try to make the game free.

2915
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:06,900
And if they fail, then they fail like another example would be you pay

2916
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,900
this much money into the game and you just get that many credits for

2917
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,900
free-to-play items throughout the year if the thing fails.

2918
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:17,300
So we can all pile on and try to like by the thing, right?

2919
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:20,900
And if we don't make it then I just get that many items or something

2920
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:21,900
but you know I don't know.

2921
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:26,500
Is that actually like functionally better than just flat it's free to

2922
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:29,800
play until we hit a certain revenue and then it's free for

2923
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:31,900
Buddy, because that actually better, I don't know.

2924
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,300
Well, I want some way to do this before, it turns free to play.

2925
02:05:35,300 --> 02:05:39,300
So if, as players we want to do it, we don't have to actually ever

2926
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:40,700
have the free-to-play version.

2927
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,600
Okay, so I just so yes, I mean, it's I like what you're saying.

2928
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:47,800
It's just, I want a way to make it so that if players want to keep

2929
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:52,300
this game an actual game and not a piece male game so that they never

2930
02:05:52,300 --> 02:05:54,200
have to have a day where, that's not true.

2931
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:56,400
Oh, I'm sorry, I want a piecemeal game.

2932
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:58,500
Yeah, in other words, like what your, what basically would happen,

2933
02:05:58,500 --> 02:05:58,800
right?

2934
02:05:58,800 --> 02:05:59,800
Is that I'm playing the game.

2935
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,100
Have the whole game and then on January 1st.

2936
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:04,400
My gang goes back to like, only the pieces of the game.

2937
02:06:04,700 --> 02:06:05,200
Right.

2938
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:06,900
You know I'm saying like I don't get all my hat.

2939
02:06:06,900 --> 02:06:07,800
My hats are all gone.

2940
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,500
Your hats are gone but it has like the the functional parts of the

2941
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:12,700
game are still there, right?

2942
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:13,600
But the hats are all gone.

2943
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:15,400
Okay Cham.

2944
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:18,500
So what I'm saying is that if as players we just want our hats to

2945
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:24,200
always be there, I want a way in December to get to that goal for you.

2946
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:27,600
So that in January, it doesn't have to happen.

2947
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,400
Whereas if it has to go back to free to play and then we have to earn

2948
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,100
our way back up to it starting.

2949
02:06:33,100 --> 02:06:36,400
Then it's kind of like there's no way for the players to ensure that

2950
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:38,900
that never happens and furthermore, there's no way for them to single

2951
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:39,600
too early.

2952
02:06:39,700 --> 02:06:44,400
They can't tell you in June that they want the game free next year.

2953
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,900
And so you as a developer have to be thinking, oh, it's getting close

2954
02:06:47,900 --> 02:06:49,400
to December, I don't know what's going to happen.

2955
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:52,300
If we better have a bunch of f2p stuff already, we got it.

2956
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:53,600
You know, like you're constantly inside.

2957
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,200
So I want to wait, I want the players.

2958
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:58,400
If they take initiative to be able to move it backward.

2959
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:02,900
In time to a place where it's keeping you totally out of the FTP thing

2960
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:03,700
if they do it.

2961
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,100
That's also I don't know how to achieve that but that's what I'm

2962
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:06,600
saying.

2963
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,800
Yeah, no, that's understandable.

2964
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:11,500
I think that's, I don't think it's a bad idea, I don't know if it's

2965
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:11,800
yeah.

2966
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:14,800
I don't know what the right, I don't know what the right answer.

2967
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,600
Is that guy I heard this I heard of this like a 30 seconds after you

2968
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:18,000
heard of it.

2969
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,300
So but no, I think this is a good direction.

2970
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:24,700
Like I think that this totally beats, you know, this meets what my

2971
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:29,300
goals are, right and you know if it's free to play as a back as a

2972
02:07:29,300 --> 02:07:34,300
packing that's fine too, but it's still like free-to-play.

2973
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:38,600
Like even if this, even if this happened, still free to play.

2974
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,000
Yes.

2975
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:42,400
By the actual definitions of those three words.

2976
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:42,700
Yes.

2977
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:46,000
and I mean, like I said, you know, free-to-play one of the things that

2978
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:46,700
it is like

2979
02:07:50,300 --> 02:07:54,100
I guess from the perspective of somebody who doesn't like free to

2980
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,400
play, it's like, why don't I like free to play, right?

2981
02:07:56,700 --> 02:08:00,800
The answer is because all the free-to-play stuff has all of these bad

2982
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:02,200
manipulative properties to it.

2983
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:06,900
And so, someone saying trust me that won't happen is not particularly

2984
02:08:06,900 --> 02:08:07,900
compelling, right?

2985
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:12,300
But that doesn't mean that, I don't believe that you couldn't figure

2986
02:08:12,300 --> 02:08:16,300
out a thing that is slightly different from free-to-play that actually

2987
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,800
creates a business model where that doesn't happen, right?

2988
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,000
And so that's why I'm saying,

2989
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:23,400
This that's kind of interesting because like, okay, maybe it won't

2990
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:26,300
work, but at least now there's a reason you're trying something

2991
02:08:26,300 --> 02:08:29,800
different where I'm like, okay, maybe now I can have some confidence

2992
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:33,100
in you because you're not doing exactly the same business model.

2993
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,900
There's a difference here and maybe that'll work, maybe that will

2994
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:39,000
start to produce developers who aren't being manipulative, right?

2995
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:42,900
And yeah, I would like to do this.

2996
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:46,400
Just for that experiment alone just to see if other people would be.

2997
02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:47,100
Yeah.

2998
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:47,800
I mean who knows?

2999
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:49,600
Right now I think it's a good idea.

3000
02:08:49,800 --> 02:08:50,400
I'm gonna do this.

3001
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,100
This is what I'm going to do.

3002
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:53,100
This is a really good idea.

3003
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:54,100
I think I'm just gonna do that.

3004
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:55,800
Well thanks.

3005
02:08:56,100 --> 02:08:57,600
But yeah no I mean it's still free to play right?

3006
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,800
Like it's still like at its core free to play and

3007
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,800
The it meets all the goals that I have and why I wanted to do free to

3008
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,500
play in the first place.

3009
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,600
Well, so, I guess Sean.

3010
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,100
So do you have any other stuff that you want to talk about me?

3011
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,800
Do we cover everything you wanted to cover?

3012
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,100
I ask the questions I had.

3013
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:14,600
I pressed on the places that seemed pressey.

3014
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:16,800
Yeah, I think somebody feel about it.

3015
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,800
So I think it's good.

3016
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:22,800
Like I think it did more or less it covered all the points I did.

3017
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,300
I at least convince you.

3018
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:29,400
in any way, separate from the thing that we just sort of that you just

3019
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,200
stumbled upon yes, that

3020
02:09:33,600 --> 02:09:36,900
Because it's always been my assumption and perhaps, I'm projecting my

3021
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:43,100
assumption upon you as well, that free-to-play is never good ever for

3022
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,500
the game or for the players, right?

3023
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:49,900
Like there's no example except for perhaps DOTA we're free to place

3024
02:09:49,900 --> 02:09:54,800
actually better for the game and for the players playing and it's

3025
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:57,100
always been my assumption that that's just flat-out.

3026
02:09:57,100 --> 02:10:01,800
True free-to-play is always worse but I don't know I've now come come

3027
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:03,200
to the point where I don't think that's true at

3028
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:05,700
I don't think free-to-play is necessarily worse.

3029
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:06,400
Have you?

3030
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,500
Do you still feel?

3031
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:09,900
Or if you do ever feel that it's always without a doubt?

3032
02:10:09,900 --> 02:10:11,800
Absolutely worse in all situations.

3033
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:16,300
Well, I guess what I would say is I think that even the premise of

3034
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:21,900
that question mean it's sort of presupposes that I don't like free to

3035
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:25,500
play for reasons which are actually not the reasons.

3036
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:27,000
I don't like free-to-play, right?

3037
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,300
I don't dislike free to play because of some inherent fundamental

3038
02:10:31,300 --> 02:10:32,800
aspect of the

3039
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:34,600
business model of it.

3040
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:37,400
The reason I fundamentally don't like free to play is because the

3041
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:40,700
incentives do not align as I explained before.

3042
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:46,100
And my assumption is that, since all of the evidence of free-to-play,

3043
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,700
we have show that those incentives actually are totally followed

3044
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,600
exactly the way you would think they were.

3045
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,400
I just assumed that is what happens when you are talking about a large

3046
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:55,800
game.

3047
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:57,600
You know, something like you're talking about where it's, you know,

3048
02:10:57,600 --> 02:11:00,300
millions of dollars on the line that those incentives.

3049
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:01,800
That's what they produce, right?

3050
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:03,100
It was, that's the evidence I see.

3051
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:06,100
I can look at the business model and go, that's what the incentives

3052
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:06,100
are.

3053
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:10,400
So it's not surprising that this is what happened, so it's not that I

3054
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,600
don't like free-to-play because there's something that I see in like

3055
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:15,600
the aspect of paying for a hat.

3056
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:16,700
That's bad, right?

3057
02:11:16,700 --> 02:11:20,900
It's not like, oh, why is paying for a bad in some holistic sense?

3058
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:24,500
It's like, know what I don't like is as far as I can tell, all the

3059
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:28,500
incentives are going in directions that I feel are deleterious to

3060
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:31,300
making a particular.

3061
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:33,200
You know, an art a piece of art

3062
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:35,500
Art, a thing that you're passionate about whatever you call it when

3063
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:38,100
you're developing something and you care about it, right?

3064
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:40,100
They don't go in that direction.

3065
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,800
And so that's why free-to-play bothers me.

3066
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,900
If there were a bunch of examples of people doing free to play games

3067
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:52,300
that were really genuine and sincere treated their players with

3068
02:11:52,300 --> 02:11:55,100
respect and all of these sorts of things that aren't really true.

3069
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:56,100
From what I see.

3070
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:59,500
And like you said, even the best example are people who ship the

3071
02:11:59,500 --> 02:11:59,800
Christmas,

3072
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,400
Right?

3073
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:03,300
Hey the Christmas crates.

3074
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,900
Good, no.

3075
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:06,800
Don't you know what they do?

3076
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,500
Do you know what they'd do, if you, if you buy it, you know about the

3077
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:11,000
gifting well.

3078
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,700
So the Christmas crate I'm talking about, is one year and I don't

3079
02:12:13,700 --> 02:12:17,000
know, which way this was, they came out with a crate, right?

3080
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,200
And the crate was that.

3081
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:21,900
I think this was for Team Fortress 2, if I remember correctly.

3082
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:25,600
Okay, the Christmas crate was, you get a Christmas crate in your

3083
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:29,900
inventory and you, you have, you don't know what's in it, but there's

3084
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,700
It's like different but they have some like probabilities that they'll

3085
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:33,900
tell you, right?

3086
02:12:33,900 --> 02:12:36,700
Yeah, yeah, and you have this, that have this at all their game, it

3087
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:39,700
just shows up and you have to, then pay, you know, whatever it is five

3088
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:41,700
dollars to unlock your Christmas crate.

3089
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:44,500
If you don't unlock it by December 25th, it goes away.

3090
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,800
Yeah, they do this all the time.

3091
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:46,100
Right?

3092
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:49,200
I think, I think that that might be like Vera fracas is idea to, which

3093
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:49,800
is odd.

3094
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:52,800
So, it's like, it's a classic example of like, the best people you can

3095
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:56,600
point to are using the dirtiest worst.

3096
02:12:56,600 --> 02:12:59,800
Most manipulative things you can possibly do in a in a car.

3097
02:13:01,100 --> 02:13:02,700
To take money from their players.

3098
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:09,400
Now, again like I said, that's not a criticism of free-to-play, it's

3099
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:13,400
just, it looks to the outside Observer like the incentives and

3100
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:16,400
free-to-play, which point in that direction are 100% follow.

3101
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:20,100
It's like, yep, you get exactly what you think, you would get you get

3102
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:25,400
So again, you know, feel free to be the very first person to

3103
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:29,000
demonstrate that there actually is an FTP seeing that doesn't produce

3104
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,700
this but yeah, I think you're right though.

3105
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:35,300
Think like inherently from illegal?

3106
02:13:35,300 --> 02:13:39,800
Like from just a legal Corporation standpoint you're absolutely right.

3107
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:42,800
Like of course that's what you're gonna get, right?

3108
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,400
But I don't think that that that's I don't think you have to get that,

3109
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:46,700
right?

3110
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:49,800
And I don't think that your motivation of choosing free-to-play has to

3111
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:50,600
be that either.

3112
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,100
Oh sir, right?

3113
02:13:52,100 --> 02:13:54,400
And again, this is why I say it comes down to that.

3114
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,300
Trust me thing, and that's true, right?

3115
02:13:56,300 --> 02:14:00,000
It's like, if you have someone who will literally, always make the

3116
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,100
best decisions for the players of this game.

3117
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:04,300
Then why does it even matter?

3118
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,600
What the business model is, right?

3119
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:06,800
The business model could be anything.

3120
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,600
The business model is we take children and throw them into a grinder

3121
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:12,600
and we Stir It Up and we produce game goo, which produces a great game

3122
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:14,600
and the like super benevolent killed.

3123
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:18,500
Awesome person would make sure that those were only children who were

3124
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:19,600
evil at heart.

3125
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,000
So, we were doing a favor by

3126
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,300
In them up or whatever, right?

3127
02:14:22,300 --> 02:14:27,700
So it's good but point being normally that's just not what humans do.

3128
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:32,000
That's why we are very careful about our selection of business models

3129
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,900
is because incentives are followed, that's what humans do.

3130
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:39,400
And once in a while you do get, you know, Gandhi and Jesus, walk hand

3131
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,200
in hand and they decide to eschew all these things and it's fine.

3132
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,100
But again, like I said, so when you're asking the question of do I

3133
02:14:47,100 --> 02:14:48,600
feel like maybe it's an okay decision?

3134
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:50,600
That was never really my question.

3135
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:51,100
My question.

3136
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:52,000
Is not.

3137
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,500
Could you use this business model to do something good?

3138
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:55,200
Of course, you couldn't.

3139
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:57,500
You can use almost any business model, do something good.

3140
02:14:57,900 --> 02:14:59,900
My thing is more like as a business model.

3141
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:04,900
It is fundamentally aligning incentives in a bad Direction and I don't

3142
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:08,600
see really anything other than maybe that idea that I had at the end

3143
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,800
that we're talking about here, that changes my mind about that.

3144
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,700
Okay, yeah, I sort of I agree.

3145
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:20,100
I agree with with the thing at the end, being something that

3146
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:24,100
definitely changes your mind or has that potential.

3147
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:25,400
Yeah, yeah.

3148
02:15:25,500 --> 02:15:28,200
But I don't, I still don't agree that.

3149
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:35,500
Like, it's, it's hard though because it is like, it's true, right?

3150
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:38,200
You're spending money on like you're spending development, resources

3151
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:40,700
on a story, you're not spending the development resources on a game,

3152
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:40,900
right?

3153
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:44,300
Like that is just that's just completely true.

3154
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:47,600
However, there's also the things that I brought up with, you know, the

3155
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:52,400
number of players and and having to ongoing support cost server costs

3156
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:56,500
and things like that which free-to-play pays for blah blah blah so I

3157
02:15:56,500 --> 02:15:59,200
don't know I still I haven't I'm not

3158
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:03,800
I haven't changed my opinion.

3159
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:04,400
That

3160
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,700
It's all like what you were saying.

3161
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:13,200
Like it doesn't like your, your interests are not your interests are

3162
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,600
to the system produces profit.

3163
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,600
That's all it is, right?

3164
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:22,600
And I don't necessarily think that that is true.

3165
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:23,500
I'm not phrasing this.

3166
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:27,300
Well let me give you one more sort of example just to see if maybe

3167
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:31,800
this puts it in a perspective that you can either more strenuously

3168
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:34,299
disagree with or agree with, okay?

3169
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:41,200
So incentives, matter, most or rather, what incentives do is, they

3170
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:45,100
determine what you will do, when you are at your particular line,

3171
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:45,700
right?

3172
02:16:45,799 --> 02:16:47,700
Everyone has a different line.

3173
02:16:47,900 --> 02:16:52,900
If you are a purely profit greed, motivated individual right, then

3174
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:55,500
those incentives are all you would follow, right?

3175
02:16:55,500 --> 02:16:58,700
So, hopefully we agree that like, if an unscrupulous person is going

3176
02:16:58,700 --> 02:17:02,600
to do an FTP game, then they are just going to look at literally, what

3177
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:04,700
is the things we can do?

3178
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:05,400
That will make people buy?

3179
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:08,500
The most stuff that is what an unscrupulous person will do because

3180
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,900
that is what the business model encourages them to do right there,

3181
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,799
okay, how can we sell the most hats?

3182
02:17:13,799 --> 02:17:14,400
It doesn't matter.

3183
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:17,600
The only thing the game has to do is make them buy the Hat.

3184
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:18,200
That's it.

3185
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,600
It doesn't have to be a good game by any other metric is that to make

3186
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,100
them buy the hat.

3187
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,100
And so to the extent where we will make a good game, it is only

3188
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:26,799
because we know that we need to make a game good enough for someone to

3189
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:27,900
buy a hat, right?

3190
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:28,900
That's what an unscrupulous.

3191
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,500
That's what someone who's literally motivated.

3192
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,000
Only by the money, right guys?

3193
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:32,200
Think.

3194
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:32,600
All right there.

3195
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:33,700
That's a thing, right?

3196
02:17:33,700 --> 02:17:34,000
Yeah.

3197
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:34,900
Okay.

3198
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:35,299
Okay.

3199
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:38,600
Okay, but other people's lines are a different places.

3200
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:42,600
So let's say you have the most altruistic person ever, who just wants

3201
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:45,299
to do the best thing for the game, right?

3202
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:45,600
Okay.

3203
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,299
Well, fundamentally speaking in order to the best thing for the game.

3204
02:17:48,299 --> 02:17:51,000
They need to keep their team picked right?

3205
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:53,600
And finally this week if they're a nice person they also are trying to

3206
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:55,500
not fire people or lay people off, right?

3207
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:58,700
So they have real responsibilities that they are trying to meet that

3208
02:17:58,700 --> 02:17:59,799
our financial right?

3209
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:00,400
Yes.

3210
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:00,700
Yes.

3211
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,000
When it comes down to the wire the FTP.

3212
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,600
Business model means just fundamentally.

3213
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,900
That, if I have a choice between like, upgrading my game server, this

3214
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:16,000
this month or fixing the store, which broke and isn't working right

3215
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,400
now to buy new items, I am going to fix this sort of buy new items

3216
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:22,700
because I know that unless I have a an excess of cash or I'm just like

3217
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:24,100
Awash in money and it doesn't matter.

3218
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,900
I need to be fixing the stuff as my prior, my priority.

3219
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:29,900
One programming problem is not

3220
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,700
To make the game better is to make sure that we can still sell items,

3221
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:33,200
right?

3222
02:18:33,299 --> 02:18:34,000
Absolutely.

3223
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,200
And so that's what I'm talking about incentives.

3224
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:39,400
I mean, no matter where your line is, if your line is all the way down

3225
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,799
to like, okay.

3226
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,200
My line is at the point where I got to make payroll or if you're

3227
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:46,799
lying, is all the way in the other direction where it's like, I'm just

3228
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:48,200
trying to make the most money possible.

3229
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:52,000
No matter what it is, the incentives are what tell you, which decision

3230
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,500
you make their right.

3231
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:56,100
And what I'm saying about free-to-play is they never point in the

3232
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,400
direction of the game ever?

3233
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:59,600
Not even once the only time the

3234
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,200
Of the game comes into play is the if you are worried that people will

3235
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:07,500
not play the game, long enough to buy the item, right?

3236
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:09,100
And so it's all you.

3237
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:13,200
You are the only person who is bringing other incentives into it.

3238
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:14,799
It's Sean McGrath.

3239
02:19:14,799 --> 02:19:17,400
That is trying to encourage the game to get better.

3240
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,400
Not the business model.

3241
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:20,400
Sure.

3242
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:20,799
Yeah.

3243
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:21,100
Okay.

3244
02:19:21,100 --> 02:19:26,299
I think that's I think that's fair but you could also say that I mean

3245
02:19:26,299 --> 02:19:29,799
this isn't true so much now, but this was true before twitch.

3246
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:34,600
YouTube is that even in commercial games, all that mattered was the

3247
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:35,700
screenshot, right?

3248
02:19:35,700 --> 02:19:39,400
And and the and the review that you got in PC Gamer or whatever, you

3249
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:40,700
know, 10 years back.

3250
02:19:40,700 --> 02:19:41,600
That's all that matters.

3251
02:19:41,600 --> 02:19:42,000
Yes.

3252
02:19:42,299 --> 02:19:45,799
And that games would only strive for that and nothing else, right?

3253
02:19:45,799 --> 02:19:46,000
Yeah.

3254
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,700
Like how many polygons going to be rendering?

3255
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:48,200
The screenshot?

3256
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,800
Who cares about anything else, right?

3257
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:51,800
And if I may just point something out there.

3258
02:19:52,200 --> 02:19:54,700
That is why we have fantastic Graphics now.

3259
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:56,900
Full stop.

3260
02:19:59,100 --> 02:19:59,600
Maybe.

3261
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:04,000
But that's also why we have shitty games now?

3262
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:04,500
Yes.

3263
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:04,700
No.

3264
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:06,000
And that's exactly right.

3265
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:07,000
That is exactly true.

3266
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,400
So, this is exactly I'm saying the incentives of your business, model

3267
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:10,600
matter.

3268
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:14,500
The fact that we have a screenshot Centric trailer Centric way of

3269
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:18,400
selling games, right now, is why our games are universally gorgeous.

3270
02:20:18,700 --> 02:20:19,700
It worked.

3271
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:22,300
Now it didn't work for the thing that maybe we wanted it to work for

3272
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:27,200
most but it works but has actually had massive detriment to quality of

3273
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:28,200
games certainly.

3274
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:28,800
But

3275
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:33,900
Massive like huge giant like you can't make a game anymore.

3276
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:37,400
It's impossible because you know you've got to make it look this good

3277
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,800
or whatever and developing tools to whatever the whole bunch of

3278
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:40,100
reasons.

3279
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:41,900
We all know the reasons why so I don't know.

3280
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:47,500
Like so f2p, that Vector, the one you were just worried about with

3281
02:20:47,500 --> 02:20:50,800
graphics and screenshots that Vector is pointing towards store.

3282
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:55,500
The thing that they need to do is have the best possible purchasing

3283
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:58,700
motivator, whatever, that is the gate, what we will have

3284
02:20:58,900 --> 02:20:59,900
Have in the future if f.

3285
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:00,300
P.

3286
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:03,500
What is the predominant business model like screenshot purchasing is

3287
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,800
for the past 10 years or whatever?

3288
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:10,500
20 years is, we will have games that are fantastic at selling you

3289
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:11,000
stuff.

3290
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:14,900
Just like you said, we didn't get great games out of the graphics,

3291
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:17,700
boom, because the incentives aren't pointing that direction.

3292
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:18,300
No.

3293
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:20,100
Yeah, you're right.

3294
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:21,100
No, you're absolutely right.

3295
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:22,500
No, that's completely true.

3296
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,200
But you know we did get things.

3297
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:26,400
You know, having good graphics is a good thing, right?

3298
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,900
And like having super powerful Hardware does allow like, I couldn't

3299
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:32,300
have made, you know, ten years ago or whatever.

3300
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:37,000
I couldn't have made like a high production game on 10 on Hardware at

3301
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,800
the time because it was way too hard.

3302
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:40,400
Now, it's super, super easy, right?

3303
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,300
So, like, you know, there has been advantages that could be applied to

3304
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:47,700
making games better and, you know, maybe they are being applied by

3305
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:49,300
people who aren't going for that.

3306
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,000
Super high-end screenshot or whatever.

3307
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,500
Yeah, that's good point.

3308
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:54,000
I like that.

3309
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:56,300
Yeah, it's good.

3310
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:01,500
Well, I think we do is there anything else you wanted to add to this?

3311
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:05,300
Now, I think I mean I said basically I say now I mean granted.

3312
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:10,200
Like I said, one of the problems with picking me for this is I

3313
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:14,700
literally don't think I've ever actually personally played a free to

3314
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:17,400
play game in any real capacity, right?

3315
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:20,800
Like I've never actually I've never played DOTA for example.

3316
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:25,700
So there may be other aspects of it that I am the wrong person to

3317
02:22:25,700 --> 02:22:28,200
argue because I just don't know enough about them, right.

3318
02:22:28,400 --> 02:22:31,200
But I think I covered everything that I think about from a financial

3319
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:33,300
standpoint business model standpoint, ethical standpoint.

3320
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:37,200
I think I got basically everything I think about in there.

3321
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:40,700
Yeah I think it's a counterproductive to I mean it seems like we got

3322
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:41,700
some more interesting with it.

3323
02:22:42,200 --> 02:22:42,500
Yeah.

3324
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:46,400
I think you covered most of the I have more or less of the same

3325
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:50,500
issues with freedom play.

3326
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:51,200
As you do right?

3327
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:54,800
Like I hate everything about her that you hate for the exact same

3328
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,800
reasons, right?

3329
02:22:55,900 --> 02:22:59,600
And my only perspective was hey, I'm not coming at coming at it from

3330
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:01,000
that point of view, I'm coming at it from.

3331
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,200
Hey, this is actually the best option for this game.

3332
02:23:04,200 --> 02:23:09,300
And, you know, your point is completely valid that like because of the

3333
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:11,500
way that the business is setup in the model is set up.

3334
02:23:11,800 --> 02:23:15,900
It is literally entirely up to, you know, a benevolent dictator to

3335
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,300
And sure that evil stuff doesn't happen.

3336
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:23,000
So yeah, I think you know and then you came up with that fantastic

3337
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,400
idea of the, the drive to make it, not free to play.

3338
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,200
For the next year, I sort of like that, you know, a penny arcade

3339
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,800
continue to do that after their first year of doing it.

3340
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:37,900
I feel like they've done it at least twice but the thing that I assume

3341
02:23:37,900 --> 02:23:40,200
and I guess I don't know if this is true or not.

3342
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:46,300
But the thing that I assume about that is that I don't know like Penny

3343
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:46,800
Arcade

3344
02:23:46,900 --> 02:23:48,000
Aid in general.

3345
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,800
I don't really know much about their business model and how much that

3346
02:23:51,800 --> 02:23:52,900
add part is part of it.

3347
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:56,200
Like I don't really know enough about that.

3348
02:23:56,200 --> 02:23:59,100
All I know is that they did, I think do it at least two years where

3349
02:23:59,100 --> 02:23:59,600
they did.

3350
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:04,200
If you paid a certain amount by by this date, it was ad-free.

3351
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:05,100
It was a Kickstarter.

3352
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:05,500
Right?

3353
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:05,900
Is it at?

3354
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:06,100
Yeah.

3355
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:07,200
Is it at free now?

3356
02:24:07,300 --> 02:24:08,200
No, it's not.

3357
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:09,900
I just went to their website.

3358
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:10,700
They have ads.

3359
02:24:10,700 --> 02:24:11,100
Yeah.

3360
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:14,800
So it didn't work clearly.

3361
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:15,900
Yeah.

3362
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:16,600
I mean they did it.

3363
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:18,500
They definitely did it for one year.

3364
02:24:18,700 --> 02:24:21,900
But again, like if you looked at the prices to on it, it didn't look

3365
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:25,200
like they had enough people who were willing to pay for this to me.

3366
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:28,500
Yeah, it was like a million dollars or something they wanted, right?

3367
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:32,800
Yeah, I don't really remember but it was, it was like, it didn't look

3368
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:36,100
like they had people who cared enough about having ads off the front

3369
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:37,700
page to actually want to do it.

3370
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:38,600
Oh, I see.

3371
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:39,000
Okay.

3372
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:40,600
Yeah.

3373
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:44,900
And that and again, the other part about that, too, is like in the

3374
02:24:44,900 --> 02:24:46,000
case of this game, right?

3375
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,300
The reason that I was trying to come up with that idea as well as like

3376
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:52,000
if you literally don't think you can if you literally think FTP is

3377
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,500
your only option for making the game which kind of is what it's keeps

3378
02:24:54,500 --> 02:24:55,600
sounding like you're saying, right.

3379
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,600
I just I can't think of another way to do it, right?

3380
02:24:58,900 --> 02:25:01,900
If you can't think another way to do it and you give players the

3381
02:25:01,900 --> 02:25:06,500
option of funding it in an alternative way then at least if they don't

3382
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:09,600
you're like well I did the best I could.

3383
02:25:09,800 --> 02:25:10,200
Done.

3384
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:11,000
Right?

3385
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:12,700
Which is a better thing to say than just.

3386
02:25:12,700 --> 02:25:14,700
I made it FTP and then I took all the money.

3387
02:25:15,300 --> 02:25:15,700
Right?

3388
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:16,000
Yeah.

3389
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:16,300
I know.

3390
02:25:16,300 --> 02:25:16,900
It's at least four.

3391
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:20,100
That's right movement to on this on the standpoint of like at least

3392
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,700
you maybe you know, you sleep a little better at night making an FTP

3393
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:22,900
game.

3394
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:25,900
If you know that you gave people the option of having it not be at FTP

3395
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:26,600
game, right?

3396
02:25:27,300 --> 02:25:27,700
Yeah.

3397
02:25:27,700 --> 02:25:29,400
I think that that's been like a plus.

3398
02:25:29,700 --> 02:25:32,200
I think that's totally fair like to do and I think it's a good idea to

3399
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:36,200
do that because like I don't if I don't have to worry about a store

3400
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:39,100
and selling shit to people, my life is way better to write.

3401
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:39,600
So

3402
02:25:39,700 --> 02:25:40,900
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

3403
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:41,900
I'm going to do that.

3404
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:43,200
Thank you.

3405
02:25:43,300 --> 02:25:44,800
Good thinking, I like it.

3406
02:25:44,900 --> 02:25:48,200
Well, well yeah, it's been a pleasure chatting with you.

3407
02:25:48,500 --> 02:25:49,700
It was a thank you for doing this.

3408
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:51,200
I really, I really appreciate it.

3409
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:52,700
Oh, good.

3410
02:25:52,700 --> 02:25:54,800
I'm glad and I don't know how much money we made.

3411
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:56,000
Do you want me to Chatham?

3412
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:57,600
Yeah, find out how much, how?

3413
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:00,900
I don't have an easy way to sum it up.

3414
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:01,400
I guess.

3415
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:03,500
I think we made.

3416
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:09,600
So we made, okay, we made to one, so we made it.

3417
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:18,800
Dollars plus, so that's be twelve dollars and twenty dollars.

3418
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:23,300
So we, we made like $32 $32.

3419
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:25,700
You'll free to play is amazing.

3420
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:27,100
I don't know what to say.

3421
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:32,600
So I ran that as a bit of a joke, but in reality, it does argue a

3422
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:37,500
little bit for the effectiveness of your business model because yeah,

3423
02:26:37,500 --> 02:26:38,900
I don't know what to say point.

3424
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:39,600
I don't think we need to

3425
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:42,200
argue about whether or not free to play him a country, that's a good

3426
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:42,500
point.

3427
02:26:42,500 --> 02:26:42,900
Yeah, that's good.

3428
02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:44,300
I think that's pretty clear that it.

3429
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:46,900
So anyway, you know what will we do with that money?

3430
02:26:46,900 --> 02:26:47,600
I don't know.

3431
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,500
I will try to figure out something to buy for thirty dollars as part

3432
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:55,200
of handmade con that we can give away $30 worth of candy or something.

3433
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:56,700
I don't know what, okay?

3434
02:26:56,700 --> 02:26:59,500
Well, whatever it was, whatever that number is, if you're giving it

3435
02:26:59,500 --> 02:26:59,900
away at

3436
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:00,500
Make on.

3437
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,900
I will contribute that a total amount.

3438
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:06,100
So if it was throat $30 or whatever whole double.

3439
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:08,800
All right, well I will actually go do the math, exactly.

3440
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:09,200
Okay.

3441
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,600
You're gonna have to wait until handmade Conte, get the money because

3442
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,500
I don't have a credit card.

3443
02:27:12,500 --> 02:27:15,100
So I confront the $30, all right, whatever it is.

3444
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:19,200
I'll make sure you very much whatever.

3445
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:20,600
All right, man.

3446
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:21,200
All right.

3447
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:21,900
Well, thank you very much.

3448
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:22,800
I really appreciate it.

3449
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,300
I feel good about the conversation.

3450
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:26,700
It was a lot of fun.

3451
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,800
And so, hopefully, that was useful and also does this game have

3452
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:31,800
A name like for people who are watching.

3453
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:32,900
No, no no name.

3454
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:33,800
Yeah, we got nothing yet.

3455
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:34,300
All right.

3456
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:37,000
What's your what's your Twitch Channel if they want to check it out.

3457
02:27:37,300 --> 02:27:40,400
SSS, McGrath I haven't done, I haven't streamed in a while.

3458
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:42,300
It's going to be another two or three weeks before I stream again,

3459
02:27:42,300 --> 02:27:42,800
anyway.

3460
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:43,400
All right.

3461
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:46,800
Well, if you want to check out if you want to subscribe to stream to

3462
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:48,500
see the game when it comes out.

3463
02:27:48,500 --> 02:27:54,000
SSS McGrath on Twitch, blame blame Casey's former company for not

3464
02:27:54,400 --> 02:27:58,800
allowing me to stream the API until I've actually paid for a license.

3465
02:27:58,900 --> 02:27:59,800
They won't let me stream the try.

3466
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:06,400
They were like, you can't show your game unless you can't share your

3467
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:09,800
game with Granny in it, unless you've actually paid for a license

3468
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:10,700
Marius.

3469
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:11,400
Yeah.

3470
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:12,300
Hey man.

3471
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:15,500
So tell tell Jeff, it's a bunch of bullshit.

3472
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,600
You want, you want to be able to stream, just the trial.

3473
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I want to just be able to stream implementing it.

3474
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:23,200
You'd think that actually streaming the trial, they would like,

3475
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:25,900
because then they could watch you and make sure that you're actually

3476
02:28:26,700 --> 02:28:27,300
doing it.

3477
02:28:28,900 --> 02:28:29,500
I don't know, man.

3478
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:31,000
Relax.

3479
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,100
Oh, that's weird.

3480
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:35,200
All right, yeah, I'll ask them about that.

3481
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,800
Oh well, thanks not that.

3482
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:39,700
I have any sway there at all, but I'll still ask because I'm curious

3483
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:41,000
to know why they would even care.

3484
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:44,200
But, yeah, I think what the trials over in two weeks anyway, so much

3485
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:44,400
fun.

3486
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:45,800
Yeah, all right, man.

3487
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:47,000
All right, well, thank you very much.

3488
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:47,900
I really appreciate it.

3489
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:48,400
No problem.

3490
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:49,000
Take it easy.

3491
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:49,500
Okay.

3492
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:49,900
See you.

3493
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:53,200
All right.

3494
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:54,300
Well there you have it.

3495
02:28:56,800 --> 02:29:00,300
So hopefully I ask the questions that other people would want to have

3496
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:00,700
asked.

3497
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:04,800
We don't actually know exactly how this will turn out and I guess like

3498
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:09,900
I was saying before, you know, I'm certainly skeptical of free to play

3499
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:13,500
but not necessarily because, you know, like all business models,

3500
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,000
there's a dirty aspect to it.

3501
02:29:15,100 --> 02:29:16,400
But that's true of almost everything.

3502
02:29:16,400 --> 02:29:20,700
So it's not so much that, I'm, you know, anti free to play.

3503
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:22,400
Because I think that there's

3504
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:25,600
Very specific about the actual Act of free to play notes.

3505
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:26,600
That makes the game bad.

3506
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:29,500
It's more because as far as I can tell, all of the incentives in the

3507
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:32,100
business model are aimed in the wrong direction and don't encourage

3508
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:33,200
that, right?

3509
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:37,600
And so that was mostly the the angle that I wanted to sort of explore

3510
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,800
there was just a figure out what was going on in that from that

3511
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:42,200
standpoint.

3512
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:46,100
And I feel like Sean, you know I mean it did seem very clear that like

3513
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:48,400
you know, obviously he doesn't feel like you will do those things

3514
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:51,300
because he's him and you know feels like he's not going to do those

3515
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:52,400
who knows right.

3516
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:52,600
Right.

3517
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:55,600
And, you know, I don't know, was that the case with zingo when they

3518
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,000
started or where they purely people who were just out to be

3519
02:29:59,000 --> 02:29:59,800
unscrupulous?

3520
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:00,900
Right from the outset, right?

3521
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:01,800
I have no idea.

3522
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:05,100
I don't know how, you know, people admit get corrupted in these

3523
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:05,600
things.

3524
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:06,700
I don't know what happens.

3525
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:10,200
I can tell you that I have seen some people who have, you know,

3526
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:13,100
traditionally were not particularly corrupted vigils have gone on to

3527
02:30:13,100 --> 02:30:16,100
do some fairly Shady things and convince themselves.

3528
02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:20,000
Despite, you know, possibly other evidence that what they were doing

3529
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:21,400
was somehow not unscrupulous, right?

3530
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:24,700
So I do worry about that a little bit because, you know, it's not like

3531
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:29,000
everyone who's evil wears, an evil mustache, or goes like this with

3532
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:29,400
their pinky.

3533
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:29,800
So you can

3534
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,700
necessarily know, ahead of time if you're someone who's going to make

3535
02:30:32,700 --> 02:30:35,000
an unscrupulous decision in the future, I think it's a little more

3536
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,800
subtle than a little more creepy, but

3537
02:30:37,300 --> 02:30:41,800
Again, you know, the fact that Sean was debating this in the first

3538
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:42,000
place.

3539
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,100
Does sort of suggests to me that at least he's taking a little bit

3540
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:44,400
seriously.

3541
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:47,900
And I think if you are going to do an FTP game, that's at least a good

3542
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:48,200
start.

3543
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:50,500
Also, it's kind of felt like we came up with sort of some interesting

3544
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:52,000
ideas there about how to maybe make it.

3545
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,600
So that players can encourage you not to be unscrupulous and so maybe

3546
02:30:56,600 --> 02:30:59,600
some of those could be prevented and they could help create, you know,

3547
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,800
a free-to-play business model that wasn't potentially so deleterious.

3548
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:04,400
Again, that's purely speculative.

3549
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:07,300
I have no idea if that can actually work and until we

3550
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:09,300
See some examples of that working.

3551
02:31:09,300 --> 02:31:11,000
We will really, not know because it's anyone's.

3552
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,700
Guess think that's about it.

3553
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:15,600
I guess on the chat.

3554
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:20,500
I don't know how you guys how you guys felt about that.

3555
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,000
So I guess maybe I'll go to the chat I guess it's oh my God, it's

3556
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:24,900
11:00 here.

3557
02:31:25,300 --> 02:31:29,300
That was very long but we'll go to the chat and see anyone who's still

3558
02:31:29,300 --> 02:31:31,100
watching, which I guess is actually a lot of people.

3559
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:34,100
It looks like you can let me know.

3560
02:31:34,100 --> 02:31:34,300
You know.

3561
02:31:34,300 --> 02:31:35,700
Did that seem relatively good?

3562
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:36,400
I feel like we do.

3563
02:31:36,400 --> 02:31:37,200
We cover the things that

3564
02:31:37,300 --> 02:31:40,900
You wanted to cover, or are we going to have to do a redo at some

3565
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:44,500
point where people send in questions or something like this?

3566
02:31:53,900 --> 02:31:54,600
Let's see.

3567
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:57,000
Gary.

3568
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,800
Johansson, why do you hate the selling of hats?

3569
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:05,200
I don't actually hate the selling of hats in any particular way more

3570
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:07,800
than any other aspect of free-to-play.

3571
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:11,700
I think it was just that for some reason that was, like, one of the

3572
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:14,900
first things that, you know, valve was doing with selling hats or

3573
02:32:14,900 --> 02:32:15,800
something like this.

3574
02:32:15,800 --> 02:32:19,400
I don't remember like, in the tf2's, for some reason, it stuck as like

3575
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:25,300
the iconic sort of f2p transaction is, I sold this hat like they put a

3576
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:26,400
new hat on my character.

3577
02:32:26,500 --> 02:32:26,900
Ever.

3578
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:30,000
So it's actually not so much that.

3579
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:33,600
That that's something I particularly hate.

3580
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,600
It's more that that's my go-to turn of phrase for free-to-play

3581
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:39,500
transaction.

3582
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:48,900
D Perry, did you manage to discuss any issues surrounding being locked

3583
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:50,600
into a certain game due to the amount of money?

3584
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:53,600
You've spent on it, not particularly.

3585
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:57,600
But the idea that I sort of proposed at the end, would have alleviated

3586
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,900
that problem because the

3587
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,700
If the cap was hit, would allow somebody to access everything.

3588
02:33:03,700 --> 02:33:04,300
Right?

3589
02:33:04,400 --> 02:33:08,300
And I think, Sean's monthly cap also means that the high spending

3590
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:12,200
players which are kind of guess the people you're talking about, also

3591
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:15,000
can always cap out a month and get everything in the game.

3592
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:18,800
He was saying that basically, like if you spend $50 on the game in a

3593
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,100
month, you just get everything for that month.

3594
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:24,500
So you can always opt to just unlock everything for yourself at any

3595
02:33:24,500 --> 02:33:26,500
time and kind of go back.

3596
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:28,400
Maybe that's a little bit mitigation, but in general.

3597
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:29,800
No, I don't think we talked about

3598
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,900
What you're saying there that and I'm not very familiar that myself.

3599
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:36,000
Unfortunately, I said I'm one of the reasons that I'm not necessarily

3600
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,300
the best person for the debate.

3601
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:41,200
I try to do a good job but I don't play f2p games.

3602
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:44,000
I've never spent a hundred fifty dollars buying hats or something like

3603
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:44,900
that, right?

3604
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:47,500
So I don't have any personal perspective on that really

3605
02:33:52,300 --> 02:33:56,700
A pigeon games with our Icarus says, would you play in f2p MOBA of

3606
02:33:56,700 --> 02:33:57,700
Master spy?

3607
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:59,000
Well, I'm the master spy.

3608
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:00,600
So I don't know what that would mean, right?

3609
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:03,100
Because everyone would just I'd Master spy all over them and they

3610
02:34:03,100 --> 02:34:06,600
would just get Masters fide right out there like Apprentice spies and

3611
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:07,300
I'm the master spy.

3612
02:34:07,300 --> 02:34:09,100
So how do you even have a MOBA, right?

3613
02:34:09,300 --> 02:34:12,000
Maybe can be asymmetric like, I'm the master spy and everyone knows

3614
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,700
I'm a master's by and everyone else is like an apprentice by and it's

3615
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:16,000
like ten on one or something.

3616
02:34:17,900 --> 02:34:18,500
BTN games.

3617
02:34:18,500 --> 02:34:21,200
I think it was ideal as a thought process to consider the impact of

3618
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:21,500
the model.

3619
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:23,300
You choose, Thank you out of Interest.

3620
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:25,700
How do you feel about a game where you start with a certain amount of

3621
02:34:25,700 --> 02:34:26,400
game tracks?

3622
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:28,900
And then you can buy expansion pack with more tracks in the future?

3623
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:32,700
Should you make them so personally I feel like that's actually a good

3624
02:34:32,700 --> 02:34:33,500
business model.

3625
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:39,200
The problem is it has a few problems with it.

3626
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:42,300
That again I feel like if I were taking the devil's out of position, I

3627
02:34:42,300 --> 02:34:44,200
would Point them out and they're very similar to free-to-play.

3628
02:34:44,900 --> 02:34:47,300
Basically, what they are is if you

3629
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:51,700
Talking about a model where every few months we come out with an

3630
02:34:51,700 --> 02:34:55,700
expansion pack that you can buy and it's a legitimate well-considered

3631
02:34:55,700 --> 02:34:56,000
thing.

3632
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:59,400
That's good that we, you know, we worked hard on and we're selling you

3633
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:02,900
this, this additional part of the game that seems totally fine to me,

3634
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:03,200
right?

3635
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:04,300
That's like people bought this game.

3636
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:05,200
They really liked it.

3637
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,400
The dev team worked hard to make it bigger and better, and other

3638
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:09,000
selling them to you.

3639
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,300
That seems totally fine to me.

3640
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:14,400
Unfortunately, like I said, it kind of has a little bit of the problem

3641
02:35:14,400 --> 02:35:17,200
of FTP, which is that there are some incentives.

3642
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:20,600
To then starting to like, drag out updates into lots of little

3643
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:24,900
purchasable pieces, and you saw that happen with things, once DLC,

3644
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,200
like cheap DLC became a thing.

3645
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:30,100
So, in the old days, when you had to go to the store, you had to buy

3646
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:31,900
an expansion pack off the rack.

3647
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,000
That was a much had a lot more Integrity because it meant that you had

3648
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:40,000
to sell them a high-priced single infrequently shipped thing that I

3649
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,400
feel like maybe didn't have so many bad incentives associated with.

3650
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:45,700
Now that you can sell a little things for 99 cents.

3651
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:46,700
Three dollars, whatever.

3652
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:50,500
Mansion pack could mean anything and it's a little more nebulous and

3653
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:53,200
so I think it kind of does get back into the territory where it's like

3654
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:55,800
as a business model.

3655
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:59,300
I don't necessarily like it as much so you know, like, for example,

3656
02:35:59,300 --> 02:35:59,800
this something we

3657
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,000
About at my rocket about how we're doing things and we would like to

3658
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,800
do games that have potential expansion packs with them.

3659
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:11,800
And so we, you know, it from my mind, that's definitely something that

3660
02:36:11,900 --> 02:36:15,300
I feel like has to be very clear what it is.

3661
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:18,000
You have to limit the number you do and you have to put in a lot of

3662
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:21,500
checks and balances to make sure that that remains an ethical way to

3663
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:22,300
sell things.

3664
02:36:22,600 --> 02:36:26,000
And unfortunately a lot like what Sean was saying where it's like kind

3665
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,800
of like you know, how does a good person codify these things.

3666
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:29,800
It is very hard to.

3667
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,700
Codify and so you know so like I said I don't know and I have some

3668
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:34,600
concerns about it.

3669
02:36:36,200 --> 02:36:40,000
I guess basically what I would prefer is if the marketplace itself had

3670
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,000
the concept of expansion pack that was something different from DLC so

3671
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,400
that it was clear what it was.

3672
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:48,400
And you could be a developer who consciously specifically said, we do

3673
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:49,200
expansion packs.

3674
02:36:49,200 --> 02:36:52,900
Not DLC because I do think there's a difference between those two

3675
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:54,200
things, right?

3676
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:56,800
And it's just that doesn't exist.

3677
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:59,800
And so as a developer it's about again, entirely honor System and

3678
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,400
Honor System stuff just isn't necessarily that good.

3679
02:37:02,400 --> 02:37:04,400
How do you know you can trust me case.

3680
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:07,900
Samira Tori to make those decisions about this game, right?

3681
02:37:09,300 --> 02:37:11,200
And, and so again, like I think there's some of those things where I

3682
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,400
don't think there's nearly as many as f2p, but they're there.

3683
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:27,500
How about p2f Locklear's with small room until they finish the game?

3684
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:31,400
Love, it would love to see it question.

3685
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:34,100
A fifty dollar monthly limit with Benefits instead of his players to

3686
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:35,400
play a lot to pay a lot of money.

3687
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:36,100
Each month for items.

3688
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:38,200
They probably don't need at least there's a risk there.

3689
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,500
I think that's possibly true.

3690
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:44,900
I mean, like I said, I like you saw.

3691
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:45,800
I wasn't that

3692
02:37:46,700 --> 02:37:48,400
I wasn't that interested in the 50 dollar cap.

3693
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:52,500
I didn't think that was that big of a fan Improvement, but, you know,

3694
02:37:52,500 --> 02:37:53,900
I don't know, it's probably better than nothing, right.

3695
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:56,400
It's probably better than letting people spend $2000 a month.

3696
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:04,900
The only flaw in your discussion is that you look at games from the

3697
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:07,100
perspective of two highly intelligent people and forgot that.

3698
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:12,400
Not even if both players are retarded idiots, who will gladly eat, my

3699
02:38:12,400 --> 02:38:16,600
star star star and ask for more with a proper advertisement involved.

3700
02:38:18,700 --> 02:38:20,800
Yeah.

3701
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,800
I mean what can you say right?

3702
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:28,500
Like I think first of all there that's that's not necessarily entirely

3703
02:38:28,500 --> 02:38:29,100
the case, right?

3704
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:33,300
Like there are certainly markets of players who are intelligent right

3705
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:36,400
and especially when you're talking about Indie gaming, those are

3706
02:38:36,400 --> 02:38:40,400
people who are seeking out specific less advertised experiences and

3707
02:38:40,400 --> 02:38:42,800
you know they might be being a little more thoughtful about their game

3708
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,200
buying, right?

3709
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,800
And so it's not necessarily the case that 95% of players for all games

3710
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,600
are going to be some kind of

3711
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,200
Abstract consumer like you're making them out to be right?

3712
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,000
So I don't know.

3713
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:55,300
Is it true that the public at large does not seem to show a lot of

3714
02:38:55,300 --> 02:38:56,900
discretion in terms of what they purchase?

3715
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:59,800
Yes, I won't argue with that and unfortunately,

3716
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
I don't know that there's really anything to do about that.

3717
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,400
What I love to have some way.

3718
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:09,100
We could wave a wand and make a magic educated populace know, but at

3719
02:39:09,100 --> 02:39:12,200
the same time it's like well that's true of all business models,

3720
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:12,700
right?

3721
02:39:12,700 --> 02:39:16,400
All business models definitely have the case that the fact that people

3722
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:19,800
are not educated consumers, as much as we might like them to be, it

3723
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,400
means it leads to worse products.

3724
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:24,000
And that's true of all of its models that we currently have.

3725
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:24,800
Unfortunately,

3726
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:36,100
Gaston 5, the problem through suggested method is that everyone that

3727
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:39,100
wanted to FTP turned off in the beginning of the year, we'll have to

3728
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:42,200
buy the standard price in unison or have the high inequality charging

3729
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:43,400
that Sean complained about.

3730
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:47,100
So one thing that maybe you could do about to fix that problem, right?

3731
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:47,900
Would be.

3732
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,600
Maybe you could you could imagine doing something where, instead of

3733
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:57,600
you actually paying the free-to-play stuff, it's more of a pledge

3734
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:00,600
drive and it's a pledge Drive isn't successful.

3735
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:02,100
That money is never charged.

3736
02:40:02,200 --> 02:40:02,800
So it's more like a

3737
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Starter, right?

3738
02:40:04,100 --> 02:40:07,700
And then that way, everyone puts their money in and if it's

3739
02:40:07,700 --> 02:40:08,800
successful, it's gets charged.

3740
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:11,500
If it's not isn't and it's just regular FTP from there.

3741
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:15,400
So, the kick starter model, I think if you follow that more closely

3742
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:18,000
would be a better solution, right?

3743
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,300
And that's why I was trying to push on.

3744
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:20,700
I wasn't so coherent about it.

3745
02:40:20,700 --> 02:40:22,100
Because like I said, I only just thought of it.

3746
02:40:22,100 --> 02:40:24,100
That's why I was trying to push on away from the constant of, it's

3747
02:40:24,100 --> 02:40:26,000
just, it's f2p until it's a cap.

3748
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:27,700
I don't know if that's necessarily the best model.

3749
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:31,300
I think there should be ways of people pledging the money and then if

3750
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:32,800
it doesn't happen, they don't necessary have to spend that.

3751
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:33,800
Money on FTP.

3752
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:39,200
Byblos says, I slept through the whole discussion.

3753
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:40,700
I apologize.

3754
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:42,600
Will you be uploading it to YouTube?

3755
02:40:42,700 --> 02:40:44,500
Yes, with Sean's permission.

3756
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:46,600
Obviously I will check with him but I did record it.

3757
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:50,400
It should be recorded here and so I can do that.

3758
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:52,900
But at the very least of streamed on Twitch so it's already on Twitch

3759
02:40:52,900 --> 02:40:54,600
on demand and will be for a few days.

3760
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,400
Anyway, regardless

3761
02:40:58,400 --> 02:40:58,600
Mr.

3762
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:00,500
Fourth dimension just wish there was some way to make the lopsided

3763
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:02,700
payment distribution better, or at least make the lopsided

3764
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:03,500
needs-based.

3765
02:41:03,700 --> 02:41:04,600
I couldn't agree more.

3766
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:06,500
That again, that was a big point that I brought up.

3767
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,700
I don't know how you fix that problem.

3768
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:10,000
I wish that was the case as well.

3769
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:13,500
Godfather expansion packs of the old days.

3770
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:16,200
Had enough cons justify a three dollar price tag that gave you 10

3771
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:19,000
hours, more gameplay, or even more depending on the type of game.

3772
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:19,800
Yes.

3773
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:22,100
And that's exactly what I was trying to say when I was talking about

3774
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:24,000
that and that's like what we were talking about at Molly, we were

3775
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,400
talking about how we want to do the game.

3776
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,200
That was definitely something that we were sort of saying is like, you

3777
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:31,000
know, we feel like that we would want that, right?

3778
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,200
You know as we sell the game and then it's you know it's a fifteen

3779
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,700
dollar expansion pack, that's actually supposed to be a legitimate

3780
02:41:36,700 --> 02:41:39,700
like buying a game for $15 and the only difference between it and

3781
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:41,000
buying game for $15.

3782
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:43,300
Is that that game adds on to another game?

3783
02:41:43,300 --> 02:41:48,400
Not that, you know, it's just something we concocted to get you paid

3784
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:49,700
15 more dollars, right?

3785
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:52,600
But the problem again, is that the business model doesn't really

3786
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:55,700
support that because, because digital distribution is so easy.

3787
02:41:55,700 --> 02:41:59,700
And because there's so much, you know, sort of uncertainty around and

3788
02:41:59,700 --> 02:41:59,800
all

3789
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:00,600
Stuff.

3790
02:42:00,800 --> 02:42:03,000
It is kind of easy to gain that system, right?

3791
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:08,600
It's easy to not ship something that's worth it to the player.

3792
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:21,600
The heat pirate.

3793
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,200
It's time to bring back shareware, right?

3794
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,100
I Feel It In My Bones.

3795
02:42:25,100 --> 02:42:26,200
Well, I don't know about that.

3796
02:42:26,200 --> 02:42:31,600
I mean, people seem to think that demos don't really work very well

3797
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:31,900
anymore.

3798
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:35,100
A lot of the data shows that demos lead to much lower sales and maybe

3799
02:42:35,100 --> 02:42:37,700
that's because people are playing the games and then just not buying

3800
02:42:37,700 --> 02:42:39,400
them because they weren't good.

3801
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,800
But maybe it's because they only want to play a little bit and then

3802
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:42,500
they move on.

3803
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:45,200
And that's not really fair to the developer because they should be

3804
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:45,900
paid for that time.

3805
02:42:45,900 --> 02:42:47,600
If they actually were enjoying it, I don't know.

3806
02:42:47,700 --> 02:42:48,800
And I don't pretend to know

3807
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:04,300
Icarus rare, we're sorry easy Sy would micropayments work.

3808
02:43:04,300 --> 02:43:06,800
That is I still don't understand why you think subscription model with

3809
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:08,100
low monthly prices wouldn't work.

3810
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:10,000
People who want to play the game will play the game.

3811
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:13,800
Well, what he kept saying, and I again, I don't know if this is true,

3812
02:43:13,800 --> 02:43:15,300
this is just what he believes.

3813
02:43:15,300 --> 02:43:19,400
And I mean, you know, I'm in no position to argue about this aspect of

3814
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:20,200
the market.

3815
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:22,800
So, I certainly can't say one way or the other, whether he's likely to

3816
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:23,300
be correct.

3817
02:43:23,300 --> 02:43:28,000
But what he was saying is, you need the non-paying players, because

3818
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:28,900
you need that many

3819
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,600
People in the service.

3820
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:36,000
Now I don't know, I probably would never go that route, but if that

3821
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,100
really was true.

3822
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:41,700
So if you're taking what he, if you're taking that belief of his at

3823
02:43:41,700 --> 02:43:46,500
face value which, you know, at some level could be true, it's not

3824
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:48,300
definitely not true, right?

3825
02:43:48,800 --> 02:43:52,400
Then you have to concede that he does need a way of offering his game

3826
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:55,900
at zero dollars to some segments of the market, right?

3827
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:57,900
And so the question is, how do you do that?

3828
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:00,600
So it's a legitimate question, you know.

3829
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:05,400
And you know, I would my answer would be, I don't want to make a game

3830
02:44:05,600 --> 02:44:09,500
if that game requires me to use that business model right.

3831
02:44:09,900 --> 02:44:13,300
But that's my feeling about it.

3832
02:44:13,300 --> 02:44:15,300
And so he doesn't feel that way about it.

3833
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:18,200
And so that's, you know, I guess where the argument comes in.

3834
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:22,800
Sean McGrath says YouTube away.

3835
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:23,300
Don't care.

3836
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:25,000
I put everything I said in the public domain.

3837
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:25,200
Okay?

3838
02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:28,700
So basically, he's saying we can upload this and also shown, by the

3839
02:44:28,700 --> 02:44:34,200
way, I will put it on the handmade hero BitTorrent.

3840
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:37,000
I'll put the raw file on there, so if you would like to grab it and

3841
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,900
upload it to your YouTube channel or archive it or do whatever you

3842
02:44:39,900 --> 02:44:43,200
want, you can grab it from that BitTorrent, the raw file.

3843
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,700
So you can just have your own copy of the recording

3844
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:59,400
and sea games is needs-based really the fairest bar, how about how

3845
02:44:59,400 --> 02:44:59,800
much you

3846
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,100
The game based.

3847
02:45:02,700 --> 02:45:05,600
Like I said, I don't really know about that part or either way.

3848
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:06,600
All.

3849
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:10,000
I was trying to point out with that particular part was that the

3850
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:14,000
people who pay don't necessarily fit any metric other than just they

3851
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,200
were the people who paid.

3852
02:45:15,900 --> 02:45:19,900
And so it's not true that that somehow aligns better with the like the

3853
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:22,300
people who like the game, the most paid the most, or the people who

3854
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:25,300
could afford the most paid, the most none of that is necessarily true.

3855
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,800
At all right.

3856
02:45:28,100 --> 02:45:31,000
There's nothing in the system that guarantees that it's simply that

3857
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,500
the people who were compelled to pay paid in the people who didn't

3858
02:45:33,500 --> 02:45:34,200
didn't

3859
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:37,700
And that's all we know about it, right?

3860
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:40,800
We don't have any data or evidence that suggests any other

3861
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:41,700
correlation,

3862
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:51,100
Character Hansen, can I be the guy that sells you unscrupulous items

3863
02:45:51,100 --> 02:45:51,400
in the game?

3864
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:54,400
You are making like the gun salesman in Resident Evil 4.

3865
02:45:54,900 --> 02:45:55,800
In?

3866
02:45:56,100 --> 02:45:57,200
What game are you talking about?

3867
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:58,800
Are you talking about in Sean's game?

3868
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:01,100
I you'll have to ask him.

3869
02:46:02,700 --> 02:46:03,000
Okay.

3870
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,500
Now how did you come up with that explanation of player?

3871
02:46:05,500 --> 02:46:06,600
Consumer Behavior?

3872
02:46:06,700 --> 02:46:08,200
The one involving incentives, responses.

3873
02:46:08,200 --> 02:46:10,500
Those incentives being used, wrongly and FTP

3874
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:18,900
Well I guess I'm not sure exactly the question is in general that is

3875
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:20,600
the way I think of Economics models.

3876
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:23,300
And that's typically the way that economists think of it economic

3877
02:46:23,300 --> 02:46:26,200
models is what our people incentivized to do and what our people, what

3878
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:27,500
aren't people incentivized to do.

3879
02:46:30,100 --> 02:46:33,400
And in general there's some places that I agree with Economist and

3880
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:33,600
place.

3881
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:36,000
I don't agree with Economist the places that I don't agree with

3882
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,500
economists are on consumer Behavior.

3883
02:46:38,800 --> 02:46:43,000
So in terms of consumer Behavior, I don't agree with sort of the

3884
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:43,500
classical.

3885
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:47,100
Thinking that people always do what is best for them in terms of their

3886
02:46:47,100 --> 02:46:48,000
monetary incentives.

3887
02:46:48,500 --> 02:46:52,200
I believe people are much more behavioral much more skinnerian and can

3888
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,100
be reinforced to do things that are very much.

3889
02:46:54,100 --> 02:46:58,100
Not good incentives for them, but where I do agree with the comments

3890
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:00,600
is that business follow businesses tend to follow incentives, quite

3891
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:01,000
well?

3892
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:05,300
And the reason for that I think is because they are the ones who are

3893
02:47:05,300 --> 02:47:06,500
actively weeded out.

3894
02:47:06,700 --> 02:47:09,700
Meaning there is a natural selection process in business that

3895
02:47:09,700 --> 02:47:12,400
enforces, the people who do not follow the incentives are weeded out

3896
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:13,500
the people who do become

3897
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:17,800
I'm stronger and that ensures that you only end up with businesses who

3898
02:47:17,800 --> 02:47:20,000
are good at following the incentives or go.

3899
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:24,700
The incentives of your economics model tend to be followed and I think

3900
02:47:24,700 --> 02:47:28,900
LD evidence that we see reinforces that basically what you see like in

3901
02:47:28,900 --> 02:47:32,000
the United States, you see primarily corporations who are very

3902
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,100
effective at maximizing, the incentives of the systems that we set up.

3903
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:39,700
And so, the way I think a free-to-play is exactly the same.

3904
02:47:39,800 --> 02:47:43,200
I say, once you have a Marketplace that works in this particular way

3905
02:47:43,700 --> 02:47:47,400
in custody or start engaging in it, I think you will see that whatever

3906
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:49,600
the incentives are for purchasing, their that is, what will get

3907
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:52,500
followed on the business side and the businesses who don't follow that

3908
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:53,500
will simply go away.

3909
02:47:54,100 --> 02:47:57,900
Now, one of the things that Sean can do potentially is if he keeps his

3910
02:47:57,900 --> 02:47:59,800
cost down, he can come out of that.

3911
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,500
Tier of competition, right?

3912
02:48:01,500 --> 02:48:05,000
If you're not trying to compete with League of Legends and DOTA and

3913
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:08,200
you're trying to compete for a lesser slot games that took cost a

3914
02:48:08,200 --> 02:48:10,400
million dollars to produce a year, instead of a hundred million

3915
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:11,200
dollars for this year, whatever.

3916
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:14,800
Then maybe you don't have, you won't get weeded out because you're not

3917
02:48:14,800 --> 02:48:18,900
actually competing in the same incentive space.

3918
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:24,400
There's room in the slop potentially, for ethical people to find a way

3919
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:28,800
to operate ethically, despite the incentives that may happen, right?

3920
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:30,000
So I don't deny that.

3921
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,200
That that's possible.

3922
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:35,900
It's just that, that is not what the system is, designed to produce.

3923
02:48:39,700 --> 02:48:40,400
Let's see.

3924
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:41,800
Is there a release date yet?

3925
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:43,000
For what?

3926
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,100
For what are we talking about?

3927
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:46,200
Is release date for what?

3928
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:47,500
Carrie.

3929
02:48:47,500 --> 02:48:49,000
Johansson know, the Molly Rock game.

3930
02:48:49,300 --> 02:48:51,600
Nobody sells you items in the Molly Rocket game.

3931
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:54,600
So to speak, at least, not in the way that you were suggesting, so

3932
02:48:55,400 --> 02:48:58,900
sorry, there is there's not a position for that NC games.

3933
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,900
What's your personal idea of the best model to incentivize a great

3934
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:01,200
game.

3935
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:03,500
You talked about the graphics focused issues with the standard 6, is

3936
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:08,500
our model, you know, I don't know that there is much beyond the model

3937
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:08,900
that we have.

3938
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:13,900
Now, we're basically saying, like, Okay, an indie market place with

3939
02:49:13,900 --> 02:49:20,700
reasonable, press $15, $25, price points and educated consumers is the

3940
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:22,200
best thing we've found so far.

3941
02:49:22,900 --> 02:49:27,800
And, you know, I really don't know how we make something better than

3942
02:49:27,800 --> 02:49:28,200
that.

3943
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:36,900
At the end of the day, purchasing decisions are still going to be made

3944
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:39,200
by individuals and enough.

3945
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:41,600
People need to decide to buy a particular game.

3946
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:44,500
In order for that game to be successful.

3947
02:49:45,100 --> 02:49:47,500
And so at the end of the day, I think it really comes back to the fact

3948
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:48,000
that

3949
02:49:50,100 --> 02:49:52,400
No matter what business models we choose?

3950
02:49:53,400 --> 02:49:56,600
If you want to get past the sort of standard, I pay you for a game,

3951
02:49:56,600 --> 02:49:58,000
and I have the game and I play it.

3952
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:01,200
If you want to get any better than that, it's going to start attacking

3953
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:05,200
the problem at the, at the market at the, I'm sorry, at the audience.

3954
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:09,200
How do we get players, who engage more accurate, the games, how do we

3955
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:10,900
get players, who demand more from their games?

3956
02:50:10,900 --> 02:50:11,700
How do we get players?

3957
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:15,400
Who know are more aware about which games are available, and which

3958
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:16,900
ones they might like, right?

3959
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,700
And and again that's that's a media issue.

3960
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,400
That's an education issue and and those are just really hard problems.

3961
02:50:23,400 --> 02:50:27,200
So you know, I think that currently the most ethical thing we have is

3962
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:30,300
just the standard one of you go to steam, you buy a game for 15 bucks

3963
02:50:30,300 --> 02:50:31,000
and you play it.

3964
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:33,700
That's the most ethical thing we have right now and getting beyond

3965
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:33,900
that.

3966
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:37,600
I think starts to get into issues that maybe go beyond just the

3967
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:38,500
economic model.

3968
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:44,600
This is adequate.

3969
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:46,800
If you do this sort of shut, again, I recommend trying to have Sean

3970
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:47,800
Plott as a guest.

3971
02:50:47,900 --> 02:50:51,300
I do not know who that is but I will, I can try searching for them.

3972
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:56,600
Girl and the coded game.

3973
02:50:56,800 --> 02:50:57,700
You're making.

3974
02:50:57,700 --> 02:50:57,900
Okay?

3975
02:50:57,900 --> 02:50:59,500
So you're talking about what's its release date?

3976
02:50:59,500 --> 02:50:59,800
No there.

3977
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,300
Release date for it yet now.

3978
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:03,400
Pagan heart.

3979
02:51:03,400 --> 02:51:04,600
We haven't even announced that yet.

3980
02:51:04,600 --> 02:51:06,400
It's pretty early to announce a release date.

3981
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:09,100
Are if you're talking about the one at Molly rocket.

3982
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:12,700
Anyway, Pagan heart, definitely, like the system of raising the cost

3983
02:51:12,900 --> 02:51:14,900
and extra needed to, for growth Etc.

3984
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:17,800
But then having a supporter perk for those who donate a certain amount

3985
02:51:17,800 --> 02:51:21,000
for the extra oomph benefits and if that fails Freedom after becomes a

3986
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,200
fallback one thing, Delta divided people into buying that might be if

3987
02:51:24,200 --> 02:51:26,600
they had committed to that donation, but it fails as a whole, they

3988
02:51:26,600 --> 02:51:30,600
still get that benefit regardless, or they just don't have to pay it

3989
02:51:30,700 --> 02:51:32,400
so it could be strictly

3990
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:32,800
Right?

3991
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:34,600
So it's like, all those donations pileup, either.

3992
02:51:34,600 --> 02:51:37,500
They get all charged and it's free, or it just does free to play in.

3993
02:51:37,500 --> 02:51:38,500
Those are they aren't charge.

3994
02:51:38,500 --> 02:51:40,900
That would also work time to switch hats.

3995
02:51:40,900 --> 02:51:41,900
That's a good point.

3996
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,500
I think we go back to no hat.

3997
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:49,100
Will just end the hats people bought all three hats.

3998
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:51,800
So you know we ended up in a situation where

3999
02:51:54,500 --> 02:51:55,700
we're, that was necessary, but

4000
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:01,000
All right folks, it's pretty far past my bedtime.

4001
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,200
So I have to go.

4002
02:52:04,900 --> 02:52:07,700
Thank you very much for joining us for this discussion.

4003
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:09,200
I enjoyed it.

4004
02:52:09,300 --> 02:52:13,300
Hopefully, Sean also got sort of what he needed to get out of it in

4005
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:17,700
terms of his own consideration and what he thinks is maybe the right

4006
02:52:17,700 --> 02:52:18,500
course for the game.

4007
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:24,700
And also I would thank him sort of in the abstract as well for taking

4008
02:52:24,700 --> 02:52:27,700
the time to consider it because at the end of the day it's very

4009
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:30,100
Obvious that players except free to play.

4010
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:33,200
And there's nothing stopping Sean from just going ahead and being as

4011
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:36,300
unscrupulous as he wants to be and making a free-to-play game.

4012
02:52:36,700 --> 02:52:39,100
So at the end of the day even though it's not really a business model

4013
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:42,600
that I liked and I it's one that I have, obviously, lots of

4014
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:43,500
reservations about that.

4015
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:49,300
I voiced at the end of the day I do, you know, appreciate the fact

4016
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:53,300
that he's taking the time to think it through and maybe to try to not

4017
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:54,500
be unscrupulous about it.

4018
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:57,600
That's more than a lot of people are doing so in so much.

4019
02:52:57,700 --> 02:53:01,300
Much as I can say that I think it's a really sort of dangerous idea.

4020
02:53:01,300 --> 02:53:03,900
At the same time it's like well since you are doing the dangerous

4021
02:53:03,900 --> 02:53:09,200
idea, thank you for trying to do it in a more ethical way than you

4022
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:11,100
have to, because certainly nothing again.

4023
02:53:11,100 --> 02:53:13,600
The whole point of the business model is, there's nothing in there

4024
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:17,000
that requires you to be scrupulous in any way really.
