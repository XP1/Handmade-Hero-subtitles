00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,800
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,300
The show where we code a complete game live on Twitch know, libraries.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,700
No engine it's just us and we are going through all of like every

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,600
little last piece that makes up a game from the thing, that puts the

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,200
pixels on the screen, all the way up to the the artificial

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,200
intelligence that runs the enemies and that sort of stuff.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,700
Basically, the entire gamut.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,800
And you know, it's been a lot.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Fun doing it so far.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm having a good time.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,200
I hope everyone else is having a good time because honestly we just

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,500
show no signs of stopping.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,700
We're just barreling through and and speaking of barreling through we

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,000
are in the middle of doing some Collision detection updates and

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,300
specifically what we've been working on recently is extending our

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,800
notion of what the world is and how you move around it into three

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,400
dimensions.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,700
So that basically we can have a 2-D game which is our goal but that it

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,099
handles 3D in a rich way.

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:04,800
So that anything

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,600
We want to do in the game world that needs a little more concept of

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,100
height to.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,500
It will be able to work well and not have to have a ton of hacks piled

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:13,600
on it.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,900
So we're basically kind of going through that sort of putting it in

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,600
and perhaps doing those hacks early now so that we can see what they

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,900
look like and then start to pull them apart and go.

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,200
Okay.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,200
How can we make this more General more complete easier to use for the

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,900
code that will have to use it?

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,600
That's going to be layered on top of it and really kind of nail that

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,800
down.

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,200
Down.

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,300
So where we've come to is we're actually in a pretty good spot with

35
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,200
that stuff but we have one major concern left in terms of our

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,500
representation of the world that we want to iron out and that's what

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
we're going to be starting on tonight and that is that we don't

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,500
currently have any real philosophy behind how we're representing where

39
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,900
the ground is and you know, in a straightforward 2D game that has

40
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,700
absolutely no interesting depth effects in it whatsoever.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,600
There really isn't any notion of where the ground is.

42
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,500
You're just moving Sprites around on a plane and you never really

43
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,000
think about the concept that there is this depth to it.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,800
But we want a game that is more advanced than that and we want to be

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,300
able to have layers on top of layers in the world so we can have multi

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,600
story rooms or Towers or you know Ledges that sort of thing and we

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,000
want those things to work intelligently and furthermore we want to be

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
able to have gameplay.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,100
And rendering that that work seamlessly across these.

50
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,800
So if you want to be fighting someone on a stairwell, we want that to

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,200
work.

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,800
If you're going to be fighting someone from a ledge that's two stories

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,900
high like a giant monster, we want that to work and we want you to

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,200
know that you're hitting him like up in his head as opposed to if you

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
were down there and hitting him as feet if you were on the lower level

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,700
or something, right?

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
We want all that stuff to be represented, sort of in a nice

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,700
If I'd clean way, and we've done that for most of the things, but we

59
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,400
don't have now is just, how do we know what sort of the the walkable

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,700
area is when there's stuff on, you know, if we're going to have these

61
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,400
multiple layers?

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,700
How do we know what's walkable?

63
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,100
And there's a number of ways, we can solve that problem.

64
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,700
I'm not sure what the best one is.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,100
So what we're going to start doing today is drilling into that and

66
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,000
figuring out, what we need to do to tackle that problem.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,200
Okay, before I get started, if you have been following along at home,

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,800
if you pre-ordered the game on handmade hero dot-org, you should have

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,000
gotten a link in your email and that link has the source code in it.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,300
If you want to follow along at home unpack, the source code for day 78

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,900
from the source code, ZIP file, and that is what we will be starting

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,300
with here on day 79.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,900
So if you want to follow along with me, that's the way to do it.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,400
All right, so let's probably I think we almost don't even need to fire

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,100
up the editor yet.

76
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,900
I'll do it anyway.

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,300
But really, this is going to be a little bit of a Blackboard

78
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,500
discussion at the outset because we need to sort of decide what it is.

79
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,100
We're doing here.

80
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,300
I'll briefly check our to-do list just to make sure there wasn't

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,899
something I wanted to do before, talking about any of this, but I

82
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,100
don't really think that there was, I think for the most part.

83
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,700
Yeah, we got.

84
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,200
We've basically got, we could go do this, the ground.

85
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Oops tough but I think maybe doing the ground getting a handle on the

86
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,000
ground.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,300
First.

88
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,500
Before we try to solidify, this is actually going to be the right

89
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,100
order to do things in because I feel like getting our ground Concept

90
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,700
in the Collision.

91
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,800
Loop straightened out would be helped if we had a notion of exactly

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
how we want to handle the ground in general.

93
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,400
Since those two things are kind of interrelated and this one's kind of

94
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,900
the more sort of systemic picture.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
So let's talk about this for a second.

96
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,300
I was thinking about this a little bit today.

97
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
I'm not really sure why.

98
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,800
It just, like I said, a lot of times stuff just pops into my head that

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,100
stuff.

100
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,900
I've been working on.

101
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,400
So let's see here.

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,600
Where are?

103
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
We were day 79, right?

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,300
All right.

105
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,500
So here on Day 70, 90, let's talk about the ground.

106
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,500
The ground, The Ground Round.

107
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,200
It's the ground.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
That's around us.

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
I don't know if you guys have gibber, have that that restaurant, it

110
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,300
was called The Ground Round.

111
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,600
I don't even know if they exist anymore.

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,900
They probably don't.

113
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,400
They were a Massachusetts thing.

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I think they existed outside of Massachusetts.

115
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,700
I think they were, you know, at least East Coast or at least New

116
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,000
England but I don't really know.

117
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,800
Anyway, don't think it's strictly good restaurant, probably.

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
I don't know, I don't even know if I ever ate there.

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,100
But you know, what can we say?

120
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,900
You know, I'm sorry, even wrote the ground.

121
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,000
I it's bringing up things that just aren't relevant.

122
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,700
Anyway, let me start.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
By talking about the thing that I thought of today, it's a little bit

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
of game history.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
And I felt like it had something to say about how we might handle our

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,500
ground problem.

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,500
And that is sort of the the Quake versus unreal.

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:14,900
Oops, unreal model right now, I'm not talking about the game, Quake

129
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,600
versus the game, unreal, which is what it would be if this were a

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,500
title in a game magazine where they're going to be like exes awesomer

131
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,000
than why.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Because of some reason, I'm actually talking about how they

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,900
constructed their worlds.

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
And if you remember

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Well, probably a lot of you maybe work too young to remember but the

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,800
way that these games used to work is they used to use something called

137
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,300
constructive solid geometry, right?

138
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,000
So constructive solid geometry, is this notion that we sort of build

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,100
the world out of these things?

140
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,400
They called them brushes often times, which is a really bad name but

141
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,800
really what they are, is polytopes, some kind of shape.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,700
In 3D space you know like maybe I've got something that's kind of like

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,600
a little thing that I'm going to you know, create here and it's it's

144
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,300
some polytope or whatever, right.

145
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,400
And maybe it's got a little hidden line service me over there.

146
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,000
And what I do is I like to stamp this down and I say whether this is

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,700
an empty region that I'm carving out or whether it's a filled region

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,600
that I'm filling in.

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,600
And so, the way that you created the world is you might say okay, like

150
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
I want to make

151
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,100
A room that has some pillars in it and I have like one of these

152
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,200
brushes, right?

153
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,500
That's like, you know,

154
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
I think that looks like this or whatever and that's like my really

155
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,500
lousy column but I'm going to stamp that around in like a couple

156
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
different places to make a room that has like three pillars in it or

157
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
whatever, right?

158
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,400
And it's called constructive solid geometry because there actually was

159
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,700
a notion of inside and outside of these things they were closed

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,300
bounded solids that actually existed as solid geometry.

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,700
Unlike in modern games were often times, there's sort of the

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,100
you know, a

163
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,900
Something that's typically called a polygon soup, right?

164
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,900
Polygon soup is when you just have some bunch of triangles that an

165
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,700
artist made that doesn't necessarily have any content.

166
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,200
You know, notion of inside and outside, there's there could be holes

167
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,500
in it.

168
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,600
There could be cracks in it.

169
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,400
There could be just fins sticking off it like at where what a tree

170
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,700
might have four leaves things that don't represent a bounded solid.

171
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,299
And so, this constructive solid geometry was sort of a more robust

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,500
Ian of a world.

173
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,300
If you will, then what we often use today within the polygon soup way.

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Because this was actually creating a world that always had a

175
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,900
consistent notion of what was solid and what was inside and outside of

176
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,900
the world what was empty space and what was filled?

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,900
Base, right?

178
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
And so, both of these games actually use the constructive solid

179
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
geometry approach.

180
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,600
Obviously, it was pioneered by John Carmack in the game industry space

181
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,500
and and people followed suit including the folks who made unreal, but

182
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,200
they picked different paradigms when they actually made their level

183
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,800
editors.

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,100
So the Quakes way of doing things,

185
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,500
Was to start filled and carve.

186
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,800
Right?

187
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,100
So, the definition of the world was that the entire world is a giant

188
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,400
filled block.

189
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,300
Basically, everywhere is solid and then the way that you make a world

190
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,700
is you start carving out.

191
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,600
So if you imagine like if we did this in 2D I've just got this giant

192
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
solid block almost like I'm you know, some kind of a sculptor and the

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
first thing I do is start to

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,900
Carve out a room.

195
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,900
So maybe I carve out a room that I'm going to create here and then you

196
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,000
know, I go ahead and I carve out another room, right.

197
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,100
And then maybe even a hallway in between those rooms.

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,400
And what I've got now is I've got a definition of where is empty space

199
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,900
because it's everywhere that I've carved out and anywhere that I

200
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,000
haven't come to out, cut carved out is solid, right?

201
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,000
And it's worth noting that there was no nothing that said that, you

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,700
always have to carve out.

203
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,300
You could then add a brush in that was designed to fill and refill in

204
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,200
back some area.

205
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,200
So you could always add and subtract.

206
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,300
But you started with everything being solid unreal.

207
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,300
On the other hand was the opposite unreal started empty.

208
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,900
And filled, right?

209
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,100
And so the way that they would do things they would say, well, the

210
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,900
universe is Giant, open space.

211
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,200
And so if you wanted to make a room, what you would actually do is

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,300
you'd actually Place wall brushes around the room that you were trying

213
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,200
to make and they would fill it in.

214
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,300
So now you would, you would never get this sort of thing.

215
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
You'd get this sort of thing where there's empty space all throughout

216
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,100
all of here.

217
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,400
And there's

218
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,200
Based on the inside and then there's just a solid boundary that in

219
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
cases things, right?

220
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,800
And these are very different ways of doing it.

221
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Now, this was a very long time ago, and I'm quite sure that the Unreal

222
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,500
Engine Bears up today Bears.

223
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,900
No resemblance to this at all that.

224
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sure that people don't even use constructive solid geometry

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,300
anymore.

226
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,700
I'm not sure when that went away, but it was probably sometime in

227
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,000
2005.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Most things that were using is resolved geometry.

229
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Started to stop

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Or had stopped.

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,800
I should say.

232
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:51,400
But you know, from 1995 development Cycles through 2000 and

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,200
something's this was still an active way that things were done.

234
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,100
And even in some Quake Legacy engines like half-life

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The concept that there was constructive solid geometry.

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Underlying the game actually persistent for quite some time.

237
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,000
I strongly suspect that Half-Life 2 may even have shipped still with

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,200
all of that such kind of in the underpinnings of it.

239
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,600
And it wasn't till later that they actually finally got rid of like

240
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,700
the last vestiges of this concept and moved over to more of a polygon

241
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,800
suit based representation.

242
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,100
But so given that fact

243
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,700
I want to talk about the difference between these two things, right?

244
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,400
So I want to talk about the difference between this model where the

245
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,200
thing that I say is that we have emptiness and this model, which is to

246
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,100
say that I specify the filled part and there's emptiness on the inside

247
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,800
of the outside.

248
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,500
So, and we'll save, this is the unreal way and this is the Quake way,

249
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,200
right?

250
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,900
So what I remember at the time being an important reason, why I like

251
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,800
this method better, the Quake method is because it meant you could

252
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,200
never accidentally fall out of the world, right?

253
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,100
The world is completely solid and so anywhere that you could move

254
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,200
through had to be something that someone actually carved out at some

255
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
point, right?

256
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,100
Whereas in the unreal method, it was actually pretty easy for some

257
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,200
level designer to maybe not quite realize what had happened and when

258
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,100
they were making stuff, they made something that looks like this,

259
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,100
right?

260
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,500
And there really was a little hole here, that was just big enough for

261
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,700
a player, jumping at the right angle, at the right time or whatever to

262
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,100
fit through and end up outside the world where they would fall

263
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,500
infinitely forever.

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Never really hitting anything until maybe they hit.

265
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't know if unreal had some kind of a catch-all kind of thing that

266
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,500
would happen but this is, you know, they would be outside the world

267
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,500
but you could never get outside the world and Quake because there was

268
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,400
nothing outside the world.

269
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,200
The world was actually solid.

270
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,800
So the only things that you could move through were things that some

271
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,900
levels on her head actually carved out

272
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,800
And again, this is the very early days.

273
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,800
So all of this stuff may have changed with say, quick to, and real to

274
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,100
write.

275
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,600
Like, so, I'm talking, I'm talking about early early, like the

276
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,200
original versions of the level editors of these two things.

277
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,700
and so this,

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,100
maybe an important lesson for us to take away from gaming history and

279
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,900
say, well,

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,900
You know, as I've said multiple times on the stream, I am hesitant to

281
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,400
make something where we specify where the ground is.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,800
And the reason that I was hesitant to that is because most of the time

283
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,600
there is ground and a lot of the stuff that we decide is just where

284
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,500
ground isn't right?

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,400
And so that's the route that I was kind of taking my head because I

286
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,900
thought it would be more efficient or whatever, but

287
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,200
Efficiency is an interesting concern but I tend to rank them more this

288
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,600
way.

289
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:13,000
I tend to want this first and then this second in terms of play like

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
playability concerns.

291
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,100
Like if there's a if there's a chance that the player could encounter

292
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,800
a game breaking bug, I'm probably not going to do the efficient thing

293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,100
that might introduce that bug or that makes me concerned that I might

294
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,900
have that bug.

295
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
I'm going to have prioritized robustness first.

296
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,300
And accept a less performant game in exchange for not having that

297
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,500
game.

298
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,200
Breaking bugs.

299
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,700
Now, again, like games are extraordinarily complicated, will we be

300
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,200
able to ship handmade hero with no game breaking bugs?

301
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,100
Probably not, you know, has anyone ever even done that?

302
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,900
I don't know.

303
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,400
But that doesn't mean we don't try right?

304
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Like even though we're doing something very complicated, I feel like

305
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,400
it still helps to prioritize because we'll have at the very least if

306
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,000
we have a mindset for it.

307
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,300
Well, at least have less.

308
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,800
And the chance that a player encounters, a serious bug that ruins,

309
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
their play session will be much less.

310
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,700
And so that matters a lot to me because I really don't like players to

311
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,000
have to go through that.

312
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,600
And I realized this is this is actually fairly rare of a

313
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
prioritization.

314
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,500
I don't see a lot of game industry, programming focusing on that.

315
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,100
And so, I don't pretend to speak for the industry at large in that

316
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
way, but that's just my personal opinion.

317
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
And so what that means for me, is that

318
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Maybe I should rethink the way that I was thinking about the ground

319
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:42,300
and that I really don't want to do the the most efficient thing there.

320
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,800
And instead want to focus on something that will be as robust as

321
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,600
possible and minimize the chances that the player can ever find

322
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,700
themselves in an unwanted circumstances, such as getting outside of

323
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,300
the world.

324
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,100
Like this case,

325
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,100
So what that led me to consider and what I'm going to propose now is

326
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,200
perhaps what we could try for ground.

327
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,200
It's instead of thinking of ground,

328
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Or floors, even because someone yesterday had suggested, maybe if the

329
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,700
ground was like a solid, you know, like it was like had depth instead

330
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,300
of just being a plain, right?

331
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,400
What I'm thinking is maybe we turn this around a little bit and maybe

332
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,800
we say that we're not going to talk about ground and we're not going

333
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,900
to talk about floors.

334
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,300
What we're going to talk about is rooms,

335
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,600
So what we will do is we will place regions in 3D space that we

336
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,400
consider to be walkable space.

337
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,700
You can move around it.

338
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,900
So you know it's not solid, it's empty, we're specifying the empty

339
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,000
space and the player stands on the empty space.

340
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,600
If they would have fallen through into non empty space

341
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,500
That is where the ground is.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
So the ground is just somewhere.

343
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,100
That if you were to go blow it, you would no longer be inside one of

344
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,900
these empty space regions.

345
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,500
And so what our world would look like at that point is a series of

346
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,600
overlapping empty spaces, which form the continuous area that the

347
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
player can move through.

348
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,800
And they are always also subject to collision with entities like our

349
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,300
trees or other things like that but they can never

350
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,100
Collision detection will literally never allow them to be placed in

351
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,300
any circumstance, where they would be outside of one of these regions.

352
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,900
It will literally be impossible.

353
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,700
So, like at the end of the time step, it is just going to be a hard

354
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,100
guarantee in our Collision Loop that you are not allowed to be placed

355
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
in a location, that would be outside it.

356
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,200
And if for some reason, we detect if that's true, we disallow the

357
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,600
move.

358
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,800
So we just won't, we won't allow you to actually do your move, if it

359
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
would have put you outside as a Fail-Safe.

360
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
So even if for some reason the cliff

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Messes up would have put you outside one of these things.

362
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,600
We just say that's not allowed, right?

363
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,100
And so our definition for ground at that point is going to be

364
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,400
something along the lines of, you know, if this is a side view and we

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,400
have two overlapping things here and you know, we do something like

366
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,900
this.

367
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,500
Then that's okay if we do something like this and you know, I don't

368
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
know, maybe we'll collisions act against it too but I'm not sure if we

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,900
want to do that or not.

370
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,600
We may not need to because close protection may just be for enemies,

371
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,800
whose who knows but something like this would not because this puts

372
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,900
you outside it and that would project you back up kind of into the

373
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,600
place where you're allowed to actually stand.

374
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,200
And so I think I'm leaning towards doing this method and the reason

375
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,800
that I'm leaning towards this because I think provides us an extra

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,300
Level of sort of failsafe - I don't know, you want to say it provides

377
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
us an extra layer of robustness.

378
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,600
Let's say, we're we're going to, we're going to have some some

379
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,000
insulation that that will catch if we forgot to put a tree in some

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,700
place and the player can walk outside of it.

381
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,000
They're still at least an invisible wall that will prevent them from

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,800
walking out and falling into nowhere or walking out into nothingness.

383
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,700
It wouldn't be as good as if we always obviously.

384
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,100
I didn't have that problem, but it would at least give us some notion

385
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,000
of sort of containment.

386
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,800
And we could also do something where instead of those walls being

387
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,100
invisible, we could do something where if you are outside of that

388
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,400
region, we draw in some placeholder pattern that's like trees or rocks

389
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,100
or whatever so that it even looks kind of, okay?

390
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,800
In the case where there's a problem, right?

391
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,900
And so I feel like this is a pretty good solution.

392
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,800
I think it's probably something that I'd like to pursue first and so

393
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,800
what that means is that our definition of ground is going to just be a

394
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,900
very simple.

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Very basic game style.

396
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
Probe, we're at any point.

397
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
We will simply look downwards from where that point is.

398
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,700
And we will see where the first part place is where you would pass out

399
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,100
of one of these regions into space.

400
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,200
That was not considered empty, right?

401
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,100
So, the first part place that you would pass out of one of these

402
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,500
regions and not into another region, right?

403
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,400
And so,

404
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,300
It's a little bit tricky.

405
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,900
I haven't thought through exactly how to do that, part of it yet and

406
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,000
the reason is it's very easy to do that kind of a check for just you

407
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,700
know for a

408
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,500
For a box whether we're leaving it or staying in it.

409
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,900
It's exactly the same as what we did in the Collision detection,

410
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,400
right?

411
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,400
But the thing that's a little more confusing is that you're allowed to

412
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,100
leave a face of this box as long as there's some other box that

413
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,700
encloses this other area, right?

414
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,800
And so it's a little confusing because I guess what we need to do is

415
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,900
every time I'm just thinking this through

416
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,300
You imagine, we have these boxes, we just see which box you are

417
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,100
inside.

418
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,300
And then when we do our raycast, where Ray cast against that box, when

419
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,500
you leave that box, we would, then do another query to see what box

420
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,800
you would be inside, right?

421
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
And if there isn't one, then that's a collision point and you have

422
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
would have to stop there.

423
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,600
If there is one, then we simply change to doing casting against that

424
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
box now.

425
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,500
The reason why I say it's not immediately is it's not necessarily.

426
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,600
100% clear, is because you can imagine some relatively complicated

427
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,500
scenarios.

428
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Like let's say I have two boxes, right?

429
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,600
And I'm trying to get outside of them.

430
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,600
Well, if, if I constantly did this query, if these two ended right on

431
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,200
that line, I might oscillate back and forth between them and never

432
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,300
Escape out of it, right?

433
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,000
I might be like, oh, Clyde against this box.

434
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay, I'm leaving this box.

435
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,000
What box am I in?

436
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,200
You know.

437
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
This is box a and this is box baby.

438
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,800
Oh, I'm in box.

439
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,000
A i Collide against the wall of box, a I leave that.

440
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,300
Well, I find what new box.

441
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,500
I mean, it says I'm in box.

442
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,400
B, I'm in box B.

443
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I do the Clyde it collides against this wall.

444
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,900
I leave that.

445
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,800
Well, it says, I'm now in box a and I just can go back and forth and

446
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,300
back and forth back and forth, right?

447
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,800
And that is exactly the kind of thing that happens with kind of the

448
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
fiddly math of collision detection.

449
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,300
If you're not careful.

450
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,000
And so I do think that maybe we will have to kind of think it through

451
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,200
a little

452
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,100
Lil Bit to see, what is the most elegant way.

453
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,900
We can reduce that sort of process to something that doesn't have a

454
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,800
lot of nasty failure cases like that.

455
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,300
Obviously we can cap the iteration count, very trivially and make it

456
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,000
so that we don't have like an infinite Loop bug or anything like that.

457
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,800
But we may have a bug where there was actually another box and you

458
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,900
could have gotten further through it.

459
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,400
And you simply couldn't one way, you know, even as I draw it I'm kind

460
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,600
of thinking about what it would be, and I'm kind of thinking maybe

461
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,200
here's the thought, bubble, maybe the answer is, you know, pick the

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,600
box with

463
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,700
The furthest the farthest Dot.

464
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,000
And what I mean by that is let's say I'm exiting this and I want to

465
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,100
pick the new box that I'm going to travel along.

466
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,400
What I could do is say well, what if I took this Vector, right?

467
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,900
That I'm moving along and I said, which of these boxes has a point

468
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,800
that whose dot product is the largest along the

469
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,300
Direction of the vector that I'm traveling.

470
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,700
Because that would eliminate these kinds of vectors.

471
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,600
They're right.

472
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,200
Because they're never going to be further than say this guy, right?

473
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,700
And I don't know that has some promise, right?

474
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,900
That's the dot product.

475
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,400
Of this on this is going to be like here.

476
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
But of course, the dot product in here is going to be here.

477
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,800
So it's a little bit hard to say, the dot product may not be the best.

478
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,600
Choice for us to think about this.

479
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,300
I feel like there should be some kind of measure.

480
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
I mean I guess what we could do is it's more expensive but we could

481
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,900
just run the intersection test.

482
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,400
So basically what we would do is we do it intersection.

483
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,800
We find that we're leaving a region.

484
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,100
So then we do an intersection test on all of the boxes that we now are

485
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,000
inside.

486
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,300
And see which one of those was actually farthest.

487
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,000
Right?

488
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,400
That seems pretty straightforward.

489
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,800
I don't know how expensive it will be, but that seems pretty

490
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,500
reasonable.

491
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:23,700
So it's something like, you know, for each box we're inside.

492
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,800
Right.

493
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,900
Pick farthest intersection.

494
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,900
And so in some sense, this is the exact opposite of our current

495
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,800
Collision Loop.

496
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,200
Right.

497
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Our current Collision Loop is pick the earliest Collision because

498
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
that's trying to stop you from moving and this is the opposite.

499
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,200
This is trying to allow us to move and so now that I think about it,

500
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,300
we actually could basically just perform that constructive solid

501
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,400
geometry in the Collision detector, right?

502
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,100
We have some number of boxes.

503
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,700
Yeah.

504
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,100
See if you're, if you're with me on this, we have some number of boxes

505
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,500
that are marked as in boxes, right?

506
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,500
And so these are in boxes.

507
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,300
We have some number of boxes that are out boxes, right?

508
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,300
And these are our entities that were colliding with when our Collision

509
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,800
detector goes to do its Collision detection.

510
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Could we not simply say that we have two t values essentially?

511
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,100
Right.

512
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,800
Um, or not even to teach values, we just have one t value for the

513
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,700
intersection, right?

514
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,000
No, sorry we do have we have two t values.

515
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,900
We have our tea for in boxes and rt4 out boxes, right?

516
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,100
And the T4 in boxes and the T4 out boxes are both.

517
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,500
I guess what I would say is the T4 in boxes, they operate in exactly

518
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,000
the opposite fashion for in boxes, we set the T to be right at zero.

519
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,300
So, the T4 inboxes is zero at the start, the T4.

520
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Is right.

521
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,300
Is one at the start.

522
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,100
It's the farthest.

523
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:15,800
We could move.

524
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,500
Then for each of the things that we are checking against we say, is it

525
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
an inbox or is it an out box?

526
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,700
If it's an out box, we do what we were doing before we do our

527
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,200
Collision detection, we see whether the collision with it happens at a

528
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,100
tea, that is less than the one that we have.

529
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,700
And if it is we accept that as the new T4 out boxes.

530
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,100
So this is starting at one and it's moving towards zero with each

531
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,200
Collision, right?

532
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,600
It's getting closer and closer to 0 with each collision.

533
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,500
And the closest thing that we hit, we know that that is as far as

534
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,000
Could go before we hit something.

535
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,000
The T4 inboxes is the opposite.

536
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,800
It's going to go ahead and save for every box.

537
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,400
That we are inside, right?

538
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,000
See how far we could go.

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,700
What's the first intersection with one of those boxes walls and that

540
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,600
moves toward one, right?

541
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,700
So that gets higher and higher.

542
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,700
So the furthest out we could go, that's the one we pick.

543
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
We then have these two t values and we say, whichever one is minimum,

544
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,000
right?

545
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,800
So we take the smaller of the two.

546
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,900
That will give us our Collision.

547
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,400
It will give us the Collision that tells us how far we went, right?

548
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,500
And it seems to me.

549
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:38,100
I could be wrong about this but it seems to me that that is

550
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:46,700
essentially a complete solution, perhaps for our ground problem, as

551
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,400
well.

552
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,400
I don't actually know if that's true, I'd have to think about that.

553
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,900
I mean, essentially ground could just be thought of as after you do

554
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,500
your lateral.

555
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
We just move you down however much, you know.

556
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
So, you know, you move.

557
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,900
This is a side view.

558
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,200
Again, you move sideways.

559
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,500
And then after you're done moving sideways, we move you down as far as

560
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,300
you can go Collision detection as well.

561
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,500
So we basically have two Collision steps, moving you laterally in the

562
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,400
moving, you sort of down.

563
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,300
I don't know if we want would want to try to do something fancier

564
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,700
where we moved you where we try to do movement in sort of a more

565
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,800
sensible fashion.

566
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,800
This is where collisions

567
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,100
Action gets kind of wonky again, I tried to solve this stuff in the

568
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:39,600
witness, using a much much more, much more odd scheme than what we're

569
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,300
working with here.

570
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm trying to do a more traditional Collision detection scheme here

571
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,700
because I feel like this game will not require such heavy artillery

572
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,800
but you know that does come with the fact that certain things are a

573
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,300
bit odd.

574
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,500
And so, for example, movement on ramps, when like, when you're coming

575
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,700
up to the ramp, you know what?

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,600
Is when you're kind of coming up the ramp here, when do we kind of re

577
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,800
put you back down on that ramp right?

578
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,900
And so, I don't know, I don't know exactly how we want to handle that

579
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,300
and I don't know exactly how we want to look at some of these things.

580
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,000
But for the most part, since almost all of our motion happens

581
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,300
laterally in that way, we could pretty easily just say that, that is

582
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,500
how we're going to do things.

583
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Now, we have another question to answer.

584
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,900
And this is a gameplay question.

585
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,100
So I'm feeling relatively good about this.

586
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,500
This seems pretty solid see where we're probably taking a lot of time

587
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,200
of year, where half hour in and all we've done is is talk but

588
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,400
sometimes you got to talk it out.

589
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
You got to talk it out.

590
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,600
So we have one other question to answer.

591
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:57,900
And that is this one what happens when you step off the ledge, right?

592
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,900
So, if I'm here and

593
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
I walk off here.

594
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,000
Do I fall down?

595
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,300
Or do I stop, right?

596
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
And I don't know the answer that question.

597
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,800
It seems like.

598
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,000
It seems like we might want to let you fall down.

599
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,900
Because if this actually were constructed will think about the case

600
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
where this would happen, right?

601
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,000
We're not talking about something where we've constructed a room and

602
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,700
then we have you know some Bottomless Pit in it, right?

603
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,300
Because if that were the case we could just mark this this wouldn't be

604
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,700
carved out as empty space.

605
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,800
We'd mark this as actually

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,900
Lighter so that you can't walk into the bottomless pit, right?

607
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,500
So we're not really talking about that case.

608
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,900
We're talking about a different case, we're talking about the case

609
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,300
where you can see, you know, a monstar down here whatever and you're

610
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,600
up here and the question is do we let you hop down there and

611
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,300
I mean, it seems like the natural thing to do.

612
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,500
and if we didn't want you to,

613
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
It seems silly to complicate the Collision Detector by making it have

614
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
to think about this.

615
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:40,700
So we could just put a synthetic collider over the top of it that was

616
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,600
raised up and so that you would just hit it, you know?

617
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:52,100
So I feel like the answer is for this, don't care, right?

618
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,800
We don't care about this, the we're not going to handle that case.

619
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,500
We're just going to let you fall and you fall down to whatever the

620
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,300
ground is that.

621
00:33:59,300 --> 00:33:59,300
So

622
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,300
Beneath you always, right?

623
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That seems like a pretty reasonable thing.

624
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:15,300
So I guess what we would say is, yeah, basically, let's do this, let's

625
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,300
do exactly this.

626
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,100
And so we'll have it so that you, you can.

627
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
Yeah, let's do exactly this.

628
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,300
We're going to do this exact algorithm that I described and we're

629
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,500
going to say that afterwards.

630
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,800
We do a probe downward to place you on whatever.

631
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,900
The first thing is that you would have hit

632
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,000
How's that sound?

633
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,300
Is everyone down with that?

634
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
I don't know if everyone's down with that or not.

635
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,000
It takes too long for me to wait as well to see whether people are

636
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,400
down with it because of course there's the twitch lag' and so on.

637
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,800
So I have to kind of wait and see.

638
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,100
Oh did what's going on?

639
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:02,500
So, I don't know, but it seems to me like that is that is a sensible

640
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,100
way to go.

641
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
So I think that's what I will do.

642
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,600
I think that is that is what's going to happen.

643
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:15,400
So let's let us see.

644
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:24,600
I am going to start by making those room cutouts because that seems

645
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,000
like the most sensible thing to.

646
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,800
It we need to make a room in order to walk through it.

647
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:39,900
So we're going to call this an entity type room, maybe or space.

648
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Let's call it space, because that's what it is.

649
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,600
It's space.

650
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,900
So we have an entity type space and that's kind of going to be a very

651
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,800
special type of entity.

652
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,000
It's going to carve out pretty much all of our world there.

653
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,600
So that's kind of interesting and

654
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,000
I guess one of the nice things is we've already kind of introduced

655
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
this notion that we

656
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
Sort of complex Collision volume.

657
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,500
So we can actually have a single space entity can actually be concave

658
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:05,900
as well.

659
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,000
It can sort of be shaped every want.

660
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,300
So that's kind of interesting to some degree.

661
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,400
I don't know how much we'll take advantage of that necessarily but

662
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,800
we'll see.

663
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,100
So I'm going to go ahead and give us the ability to create the space

664
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,100
entities and then I guess I'll just render them kind of ugly.

665
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:31,000
Uh, I'll go Lele, don't know how to say ugly in that way.

666
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,700
Ugly, I want to say ugly lie and and so we can kind of see that we in

667
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:45,700
fact you know, do have them in there and that they are really in the

668
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,000
place.

669
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,800
We think they are.

670
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,300
Let's say

671
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,300
So, if I go in here and copy one of these rectangle calls, right?

672
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,200
I'm just doing a basically the same stuff that we did with the oops.

673
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,300
with the

674
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
Stairwell, we're drawing those rectangles.

675
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,200
I'm going to say that this is our enemy type space.

676
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,900
We're going to go ahead and push some rectangles on that Define where

677
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,400
this guy actually is.

678
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,800
And so, what I'll probably do is say for each of his Collision bounds,

679
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,300
right?

680
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,400
Each of the things that are in his whatever, the the Collision group,

681
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:27,900
right?

682
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:33,800
Sort of for each volume count, I am going to, I'm going to draw

683
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,700
Volume.

684
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, so to do that, I'm going to say Loop over these guys, right?

685
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Pretty basic here.

686
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,600
This is the entity Collision.

687
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,900
Volume cap.

688
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,600
Wow, not a good.

689
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,700
Tap completion day huh.

690
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,400
You know what I'm feeling?

691
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,800
Constrained, really constrained here.

692
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,200
People like to be constrained.

693
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,100
There we go.

694
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:56,800
Let's get this.

695
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,700
Let's get this going.

696
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:04,100
All right, so I'm gonna go ahead and pull out those volumes one at a

697
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:04,900
time.

698
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:12,500
And we are going to draw them one at a time because computers, pretty

699
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,200
much have to do one thing.

700
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,600
Some you can do multiple things in parallel, but each one of those

701
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,700
Things is still doing it one at a time.

702
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,700
Very, very single single Focus, these computers.

703
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:27,100
These these computers are so I want to take this volume and I want to

704
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,000
figure out where it is.

705
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,200
I feel like one thing that would be nice and I don't know if this is

706
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,900
going to be.

707
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,700
I feel like this has happened enough times.

708
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,900
It's going to go ahead and do it instead of accessing them these this

709
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,300
way, I want to do something where I can say get

710
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:52,200
You know, camera or get get region Space volume where I just say,

711
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,400
look, here's a collision.

712
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,600
Here is a volume index for this entity, right?

713
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,900
Just just give me back.

714
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,800
What it would be in region space so I don't have to do the thing where

715
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,300
I add the offset and whatever, right?

716
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,400
Just just give it back to me and so I can use it directly.

717
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,300
So that way it's offset p is just its actual position and I don't have

718
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,900
to deal with offsetting it by the anything or if the entity had some

719
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,800
scaling could scale the dimension for me to or whatever else, right?

720
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,600
So I'm going to do that just to give myself a little more leeway.

721
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,600
So if I do that, right?

722
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,500
Oh, you know what though?

723
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,300
I picked a really bad time to reduce that, because it turns out, I

724
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,900
don't even have to do that because this will do that movement for me,

725
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,000
my bad, because these are already in entity space.

726
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,000
This this push wrecked actually takes me in any space.

727
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
Well, so much for that.

728
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,400
I thought I was going to try and I was trying to be helpful, you know,

729
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,600
shows you what you get, you try to be helpful and it turns out,

730
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,100
nobody, your help is not wanted, right?

731
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,700
Your help is just not wanted.

732
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,800
And you know, you feel feel bad about it afterwards, but that's just

733
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,400
how it goes.

734
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,700
So, if I go ahead of here and pass the volume Dimensions, I can pass

735
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,600
just the X and Y of that, we don't care about the Z so much right now.

736
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And then if I pass, that offset as well, again, don't really care

737
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,500
about the Z at the moment.

738
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,100
I just want to see the rectangle at the location of the entity.

739
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,900
I feel like that should be sufficient.

740
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,200
This is going to be pointer now because I didn't do the little

741
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,000
Thing that I was going to do that would have been cool and then it all

742
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,900
came crashing down.

743
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,700
So that's offset p and there's our program.

744
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,000
So now we need to do is actually make one of these entities.

745
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,500
So when we're actually creating rooms, we got a create some empty

746
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
space for our rooms.

747
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,000
And so really, that's pretty straightforward.

748
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,100
All we have to do is just make a series of these that overlap at.

749
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,300
We don't even have to be particularly conscious about it right now

750
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,400
because that's really something more for when we do for World, Jen,

751
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,000
you know, when we actually are going to start placing those things,

752
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,300
We get think a little bit more about it, but so if we go ahead and

753
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,400
cure and say, all right, we've got tilak style.

754
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,100
Why that's going to Loop over this before we do that for a given

755
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,700
screen, right?

756
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,100
We should go ahead and add this empty space.

757
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,300
So what I want to do is I want to instead of add Walter.

758
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:24,000
I want to be able to do ad space where I can add in some space that is

759
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,500
don't know how I want to specify this.

760
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,700
I guess I want to specify an ABS tile X AB Style.

761
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,900
I like range basically, right?

762
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,100
So I want to do something like this.

763
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,900
Where I'm going to go from the Min and the max, you know, between the

764
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,300
Min and the max kind of a thing.

765
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,900
So ABS tiles E I think is just yeah.

766
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
So that's where we're at there.

767
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
So it would be something like this.

768
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,600
We want to go from tilak style.

769
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,200
Why?

770
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,300
ABS tiles e-excuse me?

771
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,700
Hello Morty.

772
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:09,300
I want to be able to go from this point, basically, to I guess how

773
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,100
much empty space do we actually want.

774
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,800
So, for width and height, I guess we would just maybe we just specify

775
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,700
the corner and then we specify the width and height because the width

776
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:26,000
and height is going to be like that that tile depth in meters, right?

777
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,400
So we probably have something like this where we're going to say.

778
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,500
Yeah, here's that.

779
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,100
Width and height.

780
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,300
Now, of course, this would be passing that in is M, which we don't

781
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,200
really want.

782
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,800
So maybe I'm going to just I'll say that.

783
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,400
It's one of them high or something like that.

784
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,000
That seems reasonable.

785
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,100
Yeah.

786
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,700
Yeah.

787
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,700
Although now that I think about it, we probably don't quite want it to

788
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,400
go that high, right?

789
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,600
Because we want some space that solid that you're not allowed to move

790
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,400
through and that's the floor, right?

791
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,500
So there's, you know, is essentially, the floor is not infinitely

792
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,000
thin.

793
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,800
We might as well give it some thickness because we can't.

794
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,500
So if I was to do that, I guess I would say, you know, let's say that

795
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,600
it's you know, 9f tall, and that'll be in tiles, right?

796
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,600
And so because these are all in tiles and this is in tiles as well,

797
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,400
right?

798
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,500
So yeah.

799
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,500
So let's take a look at that and I'll pass these in so that you're

800
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,900
allowed to pass in fractional tile with if you want.

801
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,500
I don't know.

802
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,300
Not the best way to specify this.

803
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,000
I admit that.

804
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,100
But again I don't really want to spend a lot of time on the world gen

805
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,800
stuff now, because that's going to be a whole big thing that we do

806
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,000
that will kind of get into that will be a lot better than what we're

807
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,500
doing now.

808
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,100
And so I don't really want to spend a lot of time thinking about it

809
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,900
right now because it's just not that productive to do so.

810
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,000
So alright.

811
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:55,500
So

812
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,600
Let's go ahead and put that in here.

813
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,000
We'll we'll make an ad space.

814
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,400
It does exactly what we just said.

815
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,500
And all this is going to do is just carve out a region of the room

816
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,800
region of the world and say you can walk here and that's going to be

817
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,700
sort of our ABS tile X, our ABS tile, y or AB style Z.

818
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,600
So this, I guess we should say.

819
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:23,000
This is the mint ilex mint, I'll Y and mint.

820
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,500
I'll Z like so, and I do

821
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,000
really know to be honest with you,

822
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,600
I kind of feel like, I kind of feel like we almost want that to be a

823
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,700
little more.

824
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,600
Yeah, I don't know.

825
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,100
I'm not loving this.

826
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,000
I'll be honest with you.

827
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,700
I'm not loving this way of specifying.

828
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,100
This.

829
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,000
It's giving me the creeps.

830
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:46,900
It's true.

831
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,100
But you know, what do you do?

832
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:55,600
So with or I should say Jim X or tiled in Excel?

833
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,100
I guess.

834
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,700
Tile count X.

835
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,300
That's good.

836
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,500
One tile count.

837
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,800
Why?

838
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,300
Tile count.

839
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,700
Z.

840
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,900
Like so and so yeah, the reason I don't love this is because we're

841
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,400
typically using this chunk position from tile position.

842
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,200
That's used to add entities into the world like that and we presumably

843
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,100
would still want to do that but then we just want the size to be based

844
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,800
on these two things.

845
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,700
So now we got a situation where we have to think about that and that's

846
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,300
kind of annoying, so I don't know like maybe let's for now again, to

847
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,100
keep things simple.

848
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,400
Maybe we'll do it the other way.

849
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,100
We'll say.

850
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,900
This is going to be like a center tile point, right?

851
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,900
Like this.

852
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:47,100
And then this is going to be sort of more like this and maybe that's

853
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,700
this way.

854
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,100
So DMX dim light.

855
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,000
So it'll go from that Center out and maybe that'll just be a little

856
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,800
bit easier for us to specify again for.

857
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,100
Now, we're gonna have to think through much later on how we want to

858
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,000
actually do this.

859
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,600
Generation when we kind of have the world generating will have an idea

860
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,800
of what will be easier for us to do and and how we want to do it.

861
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,300
All right?

862
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:11,900
So,

863
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,000
I suppose in this case, we can actually reuse our room Collision as

864
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,900
well, like basically every room could use the same collision and that

865
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,200
would be kind of nice so we could just call that the standard room

866
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,500
question.

867
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,900
I have thought about that.

868
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,300
That would actually mean that when we add space we don't have to do

869
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,000
any of this stuff.

870
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,900
We can just have kind of the standard a few brushes and they just get

871
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,200
reused which is kind of interesting.

872
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
How did considered it?

873
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,100
I guess that is kind of nice actually.

874
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,300
Yeah.

875
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,000
I like that.

876
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,600
So let's go ahead and say

877
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,600
That this actually maybe.

878
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,000
This actually just works literally exactly the same way.

879
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,600
Everything can just work, there doesn't have to be anything,

880
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,800
particularly special going on here.

881
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,400
We'll do it exactly the same way that we were doing it before.

882
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,200
We'll get the absolute Position will add the space to it, and we will

883
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,200
use the standard room collision.

884
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,000
And so, we'll call this ad standard room.

885
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,900
Yeah, I had not had not considered that.

886
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,300
That's kind of interesting.

887
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,200
And so we'll add a flag here and the flag will be

888
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,300
Something like empty space I guess, right?

889
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,300
Or like

890
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,000
Traversable, I don't know something like that traversable.

891
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,500
Is that an eye or how do you spell traversable?

892
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,100
Traversable.

893
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,300
Traverse able.

894
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,200
Of course it's an abl, alright?

895
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,600
Traversable.

896
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,800
So I had it right.

897
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,800
Then that's it.

898
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,300
That would just work.

899
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,800
I think.

900
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,700
So then what we need to do is we need to add that traversable flag and

901
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,300
that'll be.

902
00:47:59,200 --> 00:47:59,600
thing that we

903
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,800
When we're in the cliche detector, that's actually gonna be in the

904
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,300
same region.

905
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:11,700
Obviously let's see here, Z supported and then we have reversible,

906
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,500
okay, these are going to definitely have to be cleaned up a little bit

907
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,200
because we've got more stuff now than we probably need.

908
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,000
We've kind of Unwound, some of our hacks, like Z supported probably

909
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,500
won't have to happen anymore, right?

910
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,600
That will probably just go away.

911
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:33,100
And and so, you know, we'll probably be able to do some stuff.

912
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,400
Like collides probably won't need to be there either because now

913
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,900
entities have a collision volume.

914
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,500
You could just set their volume count, 20, and they won't collide with

915
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,100
anything.

916
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,800
So, you know, to do, Casey collides and Z supported.

917
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,200
Oops,

918
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,200
Collides and Z supported.

919
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,600
Probably can be removed now soon.

920
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,800
I would think so.

921
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Now that we said this thing is traversal, we need to do is make that

922
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,100
standard room Collision, right?

923
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,500
Because that's not there yet and we also have to do in here.

924
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,100
We're gonna have to change the way we're doing this a little bit.

925
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,500
We would not be passing this anymore.

926
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,700
Were you passing that Center?

927
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:27,900
So with that's going to be is that is going to be this this right here

928
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,800
tiles per width tiles for height.

929
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:37,000
It's going to basically be we we want the screen X plus I

930
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,700
Half, right?

931
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,700
We want to basically make, we want to basically be the center of the

932
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,700
room is where this empty space actually is right.

933
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:51,600
So you want to go to the corner and then a half more if that makes

934
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,000
sense.

935
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,400
So let's do that and leave that as our room definition.

936
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:02,000
And then we just need to make that standard room be corrected.

937
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,400
So this is standard room.

938
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,000
We know we've got a

939
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,200
Standard room Collision here.

940
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,800
And then when we do our wall Collision, we just want to do that.

941
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,600
Same thing again, standard room.

942
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,500
And that's going to be the tile depth in meters times some smaller

943
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,100
amount, right?

944
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:29,700
We said nine something like that was what it was going to be and then

945
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:37,400
the tile side and M it was going to be in our weird kind of notion.

946
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,100
Here are car sort of crazy, constants tiles per with and towels for

947
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,700
height.

948
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:48,300
It's going to be that many wide and high, write something like

949
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,800
now, that doesn't give us any overlap, you know, if you think about

950
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:59,700
the way this is going to work, if we have two rooms that are next to

951
00:50:59,700 --> 00:50:59,900
each other,

952
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
There there isn't any overlap here at all.

953
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,000
There's just infinitely Thin Line and I don't know if to make it

954
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,900
easier on our Collision detection math.

955
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,100
I don't know if we want to do something where we would actually make

956
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,500
it you know, a little more forgiving than that, write something where

957
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,600
we're going to allow you to make the rooms.

958
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,300
You know, the rooms would have a little bit of overlap there so that

959
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,900
it was easier to make that transition on the math.

960
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,900
But for now we'll just start out.

961
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,200
With making them exactly a but and then will you know, will look at

962
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,700
that math later on when we're being a little bit more robust about

963
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:41,500
things and thinking through a little bit better so that makes that.

964
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,300
And now in theory we actually should see some giant rectangles if we

965
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:52,100
didn't mess anything up and hey look we do of course it makes it hard

966
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:57,200
to see anything else but that is sort of what we wanted to see and

967
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,800
they look like they are Maybe

968
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,200
Not quite in the right place though.

969
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,400
On the top of it.

970
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,200
That may just be because of the Z.

971
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,800
I'm not entirely sure.

972
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,100
Let's hop up to the next level and see if that's in a more sane spot

973
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,100
and it does look like it's in a pretty soon spot.

974
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,500
Actually, now the question would be what happens here.

975
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,600
I'm not sure if I actually colliding with that entity, what is

976
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,800
actually happening there like why can't I go?

977
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,500
Go through there.

978
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,400
Does anyone know?

979
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,500
I have no idea.

980
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,600
I'm interested to know.

981
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,800
Let's take a quick look.

982
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,300
I want to know if I'm actually colliding that because we didn't set it

983
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,000
collides to be true, right?

984
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,800
So in theory, that should not be the case, but I want to see

985
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,200
If that's actually what's happening there or if we had some bug, but

986
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,600
from before that we weren't handling.

987
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,500
So what I did is I hopped up to the next level, they're like so and I

988
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,300
tried to go through here and I could go through.

989
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,400
So it seems like we're Collision detecting against those entities,

990
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,100
even though collides was not set which suggests to me that we have a

991
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:10,700
bug in there, which is that collides is not actually being checked

992
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,100
properly and and so I would like to see why that is

993
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,000
Let's let's double check to make sure we're not we're not setting

994
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,400
because their standard room and just traversable as being set.

995
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,600
I didn't do something stupid.

996
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,300
Did I like make traversable be the same value?

997
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,800
Oh, why did I set the?

998
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,800
Why am i setting these that way?

999
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:34,300
We don't need to set those to go up by powers to but yet, even so it

1000
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:34,800
doesn't matter.

1001
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,300
We weren't over writing this, or anything.

1002
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,900
And so, as far as I can tell,

1003
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
That's just a straight-up fun.

1004
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,400
So, let's see why we're actually colliding against those standard

1005
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,900
rooms.

1006
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,500
It doesn't seem to make much sense to me.

1007
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,000
So, let's see where we checking the Collide slack here.

1008
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,700
So we're not even checking the collides flag, that we don't even check

1009
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,600
that flag anymore.

1010
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,600
We were just full on

1011
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,800
Ignoring that flag entirely.

1012
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,800
And so, when we call can Collide I strongly suspect that what we

1013
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:12,400
probably should have been doing here is saying something like, you

1014
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:21,700
know, if, if, you know, if a something like this, right?

1015
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,600
If a collides and be collides,

1016
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:33,400
Then we can actually do this termination, this determination, right?

1017
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,900
Otherwise, we just assume that they can Collide because we really

1018
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,500
don't want anyone colliding with those things.

1019
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,600
That's not good.

1020
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,000
So that's fine.

1021
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,300
There we go.

1022
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,500
So, here we are.

1023
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,900
Oh, I fell through the stairwell.

1024
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,500
Whoops.

1025
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,200
So there we go.

1026
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,800
Much better now.

1027
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,400
It's going to be impossible to see.

1028
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,800
So what I would like to do is I'd like to make something that allows

1029
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,600
it a little bit so that we can see our Region's a little bit better.

1030
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,900
And so what I'm going to do is just kind of make a real simple

1031
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,600
modification to our push wrecked call as soon as the five-minute

1032
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,400
warning subsides.

1033
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,000
I don't make a little modification to our push wrecked call and that

1034
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,100
push wrecked call is is going to

1035
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,000
Essentially do a series of push Rex, so like push wrecked, outline

1036
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,100
something like that.

1037
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,900
And what that's going to do is that's just going to do a push piece

1038
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,000
for each of the four walls, four lines of rectangles going to push

1039
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
like four separate, rectangles, basically so that we can see an

1040
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,900
outline of the region.

1041
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,700
Instead of this big solid region that obscures everything that we're

1042
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,300
trying to look at.

1043
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,000
And again since we don't really have a renderer yet, this would be the

1044
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,400
kind of thing.

1045
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,300
The renderer would take care of it for us but until we get there we've

1046
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,000
got to make do with

1047
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,800
We have so it looks to me like the way this is working is it just

1048
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,500
pushes the location of the thing and then add an offset that's going

1049
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,800
to spread out from and so in order to make this work, what I would

1050
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,600
want to do is I'd want to do, you know, two batches top and bottom

1051
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,700
right and left and right.

1052
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,200
The top and bottom are going to be wherever I was the offset.

1053
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,000
I want to basically,

1054
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,400
Move over by whatever.

1055
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:27,300
I want to basically move up and down by that dim.

1056
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,300
However, however, big the rectangle was, right.

1057
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,300
I'll draw this out for you.

1058
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,900
For those of you who don't write this kind of code, very often grab my

1059
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:36,600
color back.

1060
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:42,900
So what I want to do here is I've got a rectangle and I want to make

1061
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,400
rectangles that go around it like this.

1062
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,500
So I want to make like a rectangle here.

1063
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:50,900
Right?

1064
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,900
And a rectangle here to start with.

1065
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,900
Like so, and so I've got this and I've got the dimension.

1066
00:56:58,900 --> 00:56:59,900
So what I want to do is I

1067
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,300
To move up to where the rectangle was its Dimension, right?

1068
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,200
It's Dimension y.

1069
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,600
So, this is the dimension in y.

1070
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,900
Well, it's half the dimension in y, right?

1071
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,000
I want to go half the mention, a why up?

1072
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:21,100
And I want to go out to the along the dimension, X back and, and

1073
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,700
forward.

1074
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,700
So it's Dimension in X is going to be the same, right?

1075
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,100
The thing that I drawers Dimension X is going to be the same.

1076
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,700
It's Dimension Y is going to be however

1077
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,400
Thick.

1078
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,100
I want that line to be and its position is going to be whatever

1079
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,400
position.

1080
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,300
The rectangle is in - that Dimension y, right?

1081
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,100
That's I'm just constructing that case.

1082
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,100
So what I want to do is I want to again take that offset.

1083
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,200
I want to move it, by whatever the dimension is, and why that I've

1084
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,200
been told to draw, and then instead of the dimension that I was going

1085
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,800
to draw, I want to take the dimension in X, leave that the same and

1086
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,500
then do like a thickness parameter, right?

1087
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And for the thickness parameter, I don't know what this would actually

1088
00:57:59,600 --> 00:57:59,900
be.

1089
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,600
It's a good question, the dimension.

1090
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,200
I don't know that the dimension.

1091
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,000
What is the dimension since?

1092
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,300
This is all really ad-hoc.

1093
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,000
We've never defined.

1094
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,500
Like what is the dimension even in when it draws the rectangle?

1095
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,200
I'm not sure.

1096
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,600
And so we kind of have to see.

1097
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,700
Is that in pixels?

1098
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,000
It is in pixels, I'm sorry.

1099
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,500
It is not in Texas, it's in meters.

1100
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,600
So we want something very thin right.

1101
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,200
We want not very many meters at all.

1102
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,800
We want like a centimeter let's say or

1103
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,900
Or a dam?

1104
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,200
I don't know.

1105
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:31,800
Exact time around.

1106
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,300
Let's say a centimeter for now is how thick that's going to be.

1107
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:39,200
And again this is just going to be something that we do for both

1108
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:39,700
directions.

1109
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:44,300
So we want the, the top and the bottom, and those are exactly the same

1110
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:47,300
just offset that this accident kind of rectangle and then we want to

1111
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,600
do the same thing again but this time we want to do it with the X,

1112
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,200
right?

1113
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,100
Instead of the Y to make the left and right side.

1114
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,900
So this time we're going to have that y Dimension becomes the

1115
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,600
thickness for us.

1116
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,100
Right?

1117
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,400
And so that's that's all I want to do there.

1118
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,900
And now when we do push wrecked, we can also do outlines of rectangles

1119
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,000
and, and that'll make it easier to see that stuff.

1120
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,600
So, let's see if that worked at all.

1121
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,200
Right, we're kind of running out of time here.

1122
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,100
That's it.

1123
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,400
Not I do not see any rectangles.

1124
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,200
Oh, because

1125
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,800
Too thin looks like well, let's take a look.

1126
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,200
Let's make that a little thicker.

1127
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,100
Push wrecked outline like so just want to make sure it also is offset

1128
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,300
when I do a push piece.

1129
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,000
Offset is Multiplied.

1130
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,200
Me those pictures in there, right?

1131
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah, it is.

1132
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,400
So in theory, that should be okay.

1133
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,400
So I'm just going to go ahead and make thickness little thicker.

1134
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,100
I just want to see what happens there.

1135
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,200
All right, so there's and

1136
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,100
We're still a little buggy here because that's just drawing one line

1137
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:57,200
there.

1138
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,300
That doesn't make any sense.

1139
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,800
So, let me double-check what I have.

1140
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,000
On incorrectly.

1141
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,600
As I have done something incorrectly, I can tell you that right now.

1142
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,800
Let's see.

1143
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,000
So we've got thickness.

1144
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,400
We have the dimension in X, we are drawing.

1145
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,900
So I'm not sure why we're not seeing more of that show up.

1146
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:26,100
We're only seeing our left and well, I guess just are left would show

1147
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:26,200
up.

1148
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:31,000
We're not ever even seeing any of these show up at all, which is kind

1149
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,500
of a little bit odd.

1150
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,400
I would say.

1151
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,900
So I'm not sure why that actually is the case.

1152
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,200
And our Q&A is supposed to begin now.

1153
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:40,600
So I don't know.

1154
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,300
Can we debug this in just a few seconds?

1155
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,400
I'm not sure.

1156
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,500
But maybe we'll just take a quick look and see because like I said, I

1157
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,000
don't like to really leave bugs till the next day, if I can avoid it.

1158
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,900
Unfortunately, when you're only programming for an hour on stream, it

1159
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,000
can be kind of tough to actually make sure that you get everything

1160
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,600
that you want it.

1161
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,500
So push wrecked outline, here we go.

1162
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,600
Right, let's see what we end up with here in terms of our pieces.

1163
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,900
So here's our piece group, right?

1164
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,800
And there's our pieces.

1165
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:19,400
So we're going to go through and push these, we push on a piece, a

1166
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,100
piece, a piece, a piece.

1167
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:26,300
So we do have four pieces that got pushed and let's see what they are.

1168
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,100
So we have two of them.

1169
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,000
We've got one with that y offset, one with this way offsets.

1170
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,200
We have now is the offset.

1171
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,500
We have to make sure that the offsets actually still in meters.

1172
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,200
We want to make sure that the offset is not getting multiplied in some

1173
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,000
weird way I suppose, but it's getting its get multiplied up in here so

1174
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,600
that's should be fine.

1175
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,000
Right.

1176
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,000
Is there something?

1177
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,400
I mean, let me double-check something.

1178
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,100
When we actually draw our pieces, what's the definition for the

1179
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,800
rectangle?

1180
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:05,500
Let's go take a look, because I believe we said before that, it was

1181
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,300
all janky.

1182
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,000
Remember, I think, I think we talked about this before.

1183
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:18,000
So, when we draw a rectangle, we do the center - the half Dem, ah, I

1184
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,900
did forget to multiply the dim by half, so there is that.

1185
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,100
I don't know if that's in the entirety of our problem, though.

1186
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,200
But let's see Center - half Tim Center Plus

1187
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,400
After him the center is what I think it should be the entity.

1188
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,500
Ground Point does look good.

1189
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:40,000
But I did forget to multiply, I said that it was half, but then I

1190
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,200
didn't actually do past so we should actually fix that.

1191
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,300
Like so, but I don't know that that would account for the entirety of

1192
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,000
our problem.

1193
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,800
Unfortunately.

1194
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,000
So let's go ahead and keep going here.

1195
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,800
Let's run that and and recompile.

1196
01:02:59,500 --> 01:02:59,900
So there we

1197
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:03,500
Is that the entirety of our problem?

1198
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,200
That was the entirety of our problem.

1199
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,300
All right, so that wasn't so hard to debug.

1200
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,300
There we go.

1201
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,700
It does fit the room nicely, so that's good.

1202
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:19,100
And we can go ahead and go up here that the top ones drawing wrong

1203
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,400
because it's not using the Z fudge.

1204
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,800
When we go upstairs it should be drawn right there, it is and we can

1205
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,800
go through and into the next room.

1206
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,600
So now we've got those boundaries in our room set up so that sets us

1207
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,500
up for tomorrow doing what I said we were going to do where we can

1208
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,300
actually now treat those as

1209
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,300
In out and that'll set us up pretty good for creating some multi-stage

1210
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,900
rooms and so maybe that's if we have time tomorrow to do, that will do

1211
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,100
that.

1212
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,500
If we don't that'll be our Monday thing as well.

1213
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Alright, so now we can go and actually start things up.

1214
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:49,900
Let me

1215
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,000
Get the Q&A go in here.

1216
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,100
Let's see here.

1217
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,800
How do I start the Q&A Q&A?

1218
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,500
Here we go.

1219
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,200
The QA has been started.

1220
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,200
So yeah, if you could, please keep your questions and stuff that we

1221
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:16,000
well you know what, I'm suspecting that if it's been relatively quiet

1222
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,800
that I see someone saying where are the trolls today I'm guessing that

1223
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,500
the questions will be pretty reasonable today as opposed to days when

1224
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,800
sometimes it's a madhouse.

1225
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,900
So but yeah, prefix your questions with Q:, if you can try to keep

1226
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:34,500
them on topic and and I will answer on-topic questions.

1227
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,700
Obviously.

1228
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:36,600
Play.

1229
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,500
So anytime I see a non topic question.

1230
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,900
It takes priority over anything.

1231
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,900
That might be off topic.

1232
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,600
Let's see.

1233
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,500
Let's see, so I don't see any particularly on topic question.

1234
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,600
So I'm going to answer some off-topic questions until

1235
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,300
Until we get some on top of months.

1236
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,900
So what setup do I use for debugging on Linux?

1237
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:19,100
Unfortunately, the answer is printf Linux the buggers don't actually

1238
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,700
work at all in my experience, especially not on laptops if you have

1239
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,600
optimists which all laptops, all dead laptops.

1240
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:34,200
Do I mean, I said about with printf, I use QT Creator to some extent

1241
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,300
But it can't even really inspect variables, it doesn't work properly

1242
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,800
most of the time and even GDB doesn't work, a lot of the time.

1243
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
It's just it's too fucking on.

1244
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:49,700
Linux is a very sad and very unfortunate experience.

1245
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,200
So I mostly just use my own debugging, you know, I do it old school

1246
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,600
style.

1247
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,800
Like I mean, when I grew up programming without it about her and

1248
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,300
No, I just I wing it.

1249
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,900
It's by far.

1250
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,000
The worst thing about Linux right now is the debuggers are awful.

1251
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,000
And I think that that's something that really could make a massive

1252
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,700
difference on for developing on links as if someone came along and

1253
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:21,900
made an actual good to butter, but it hasn't happened yet.

1254
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:25,300
So hopefully it'll happen in the future because I like Linux

1255
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,200
And I would like to see it have a good development environment and

1256
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,000
right now it does not have that.

1257
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,200
It might have that for other languages like maybe the Java debugger

1258
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,700
let's say is is good, you know, if you run a Clips or something, I

1259
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:41,200
don't know.

1260
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,200
But the C++ de bugging is real bad.

1261
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,000
And especially C plus plus plus C, plus plus, and opengl Optimus is,

1262
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,300
is really bad.

1263
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,400
Let's see.

1264
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,900
Can you upload the video somewhere else?

1265
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,500
YouTube is blocked in China?

1266
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,800
I would like to watch from the beginning, so it's on my list of things

1267
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,100
to do.

1268
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:14,800
I just haven't gotten around to that yet, basically their Italy really

1269
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,700
isn't anywhere else.

1270
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,200
I can put the videos that would allow as much data as we have, but I

1271
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,300
was going to try to set up a BitTorrent sync that people could like,

1272
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,900
you know, get on or whatever.

1273
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,800
So, it is on my list of things to do but I have not had a chance to do

1274
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:28,800
it.

1275
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,500
That I'm sorry to hear that it is blocked in your country and I would

1276
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:38,300
like to fix that eventually but I just haven't had time to really

1277
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,300
figure out how to do that.

1278
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,000
Let's see when doing the vertical movement, would it be reasonable to

1279
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,400
take two measurements, one at the current position than one at final

1280
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,700
move position and average the movement.

1281
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:00,600
I'm not sure what you mean by average the movement?

1282
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,600
I'm not sure, I totally understand the question.

1283
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,200
I suspect.

1284
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,800
The answer is no, it doesn't sound reasonable, what you're saying?

1285
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,300
But I'm not sure, I understand exactly what you're saying.

1286
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,400
So maybe that you are saying something that I would think was

1287
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,100
reasonable and my answer your question would be, yes, it is reasonable

1288
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,300
to do but I don't know.

1289
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,800
My gut reaction is know if I'm interpreting it correctly.

1290
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:31,000
Our walls going to be entities or just byproducts of subtracting of

1291
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,899
the room volume, we will have the freedom to do both.

1292
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,000
So I suspect which one we do will depend on the type of room, forests

1293
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,399
will probably be like entities for the trees because they'll form a

1294
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,600
very irregular border that we probably want to capture with entities

1295
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,800
but like dungeon rooms.

1296
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,600
Maybe we'll just be cut out.

1297
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,100
I don't know.

1298
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,399
Devil DB works better than GDP if you can deal with the command line,

1299
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,000
interface.

1300
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,399
Well, you know, if once you're on a command line for debugging, it's

1301
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,899
so slow that I'm usually much faster with printf than I am with a

1302
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:15,399
command line to butter because the only benefit that I really get out

1303
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:22,300
of a debugger is fast, visualization of values and that is exactly the

1304
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:28,000
thing that GDB and LL to be, don't do well right, they're really bad

1305
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,700
at giving you a good, snapshot a good visual, snapshot.

1306
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,700
Of what everything's doing in your code.

1307
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,399
So I suspect that like I just wouldn't I just probably keep keep

1308
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,800
printf and I'm saying

1309
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,100
D, Johnstone 8, should you have been able to jump up to a level above

1310
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:44,500
the player?

1311
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,000
Now that you have a point nine value for the Spacey volume?

1312
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,200
Well, you should be able to answer that question.

1313
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,500
but just in case you cannot

1314
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,400
the reason that it doesn't matter what we said that value to it,

1315
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,200
because we haven't done the Collision detection for in boxes yet.

1316
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,700
So they are literally non-participatory, right?

1317
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,500
They don't.

1318
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,600
We just drew all we did was add them and draw them.

1319
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,500
Tomorrow will be the time when we add in the closed loop and then if

1320
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,500
we can jump up, it's a bug.

1321
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,500
But right now, not a bug,

1322
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,300
Well, the entities not at the Players sea level always be at the same

1323
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,800
Alpha transparency or will they be slightly less visible to show that

1324
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,200
they are on a different sea level.

1325
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,800
My guess.

1326
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,400
We'll, we have it to do, right?

1327
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,200
Which is probably the very next one.

1328
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,900
After all this stuff is working to our satisfaction is, how is this

1329
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:40,400
rendered?

1330
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,000
And my suspicion is, what will basically do is anything that's on the

1331
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,900
current level.

1332
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,400
If you're standing on the ground is probably solid, anything below.

1333
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,400
You is solid and everything above, you is invisible when you start to

1334
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:53,500
walk.

1335
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,700
Up a ramp will probably move the camera up and fade in the top level

1336
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,200
or something, that's my guess.

1337
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,200
But that's the kind of thing that we're going to want to play around

1338
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,400
with.

1339
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,800
Like I said, I've never written a 2-D game before every time I've even

1340
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,600
made, like I guess I guess I did do one 2-D game for the game Jam,

1341
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:19,500
Even but all the rest of my game Jam, games were all 3D even and so

1342
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:22,600
anything that I've ever coded is always been in 3D for the most part

1343
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,700
and so I don't have a lot of

1344
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,100
Of strong opinions about how I want to do 2D things.

1345
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,700
So it's very exploratory for me.

1346
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,400
And I'm going through and saying, all right, what do I like about

1347
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:30,600
this?

1348
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,500
What do I not like?

1349
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:36,000
You know, so that's my, my gut feeling about how I'm going to do it,

1350
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,500
but we'll have to see when we actually do it.

1351
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:38,500
What we like, what we don't like.

1352
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,200
And maybe we'll have some thoughts about how we want it to work, I

1353
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,600
don't know.

1354
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:59,200
Why should anyone trust you to annotate a game when you have no

1355
01:11:59,200 --> 01:11:59,800
published success?

1356
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,800
Purring a full-fledged commercial game.

1357
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,900
Whoa, that's them's.

1358
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:09,200
Fightin words, I probably have code in more published commercial games

1359
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,700
than almost anyone.

1360
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,100
I know, besides maybe Jeff.

1361
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,000
So I don't know what you mean by that.

1362
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,300
If you're talking about the fact that I don't design games, that's

1363
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,300
true, but this isn't a game design course.

1364
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:29,800
This is a game programming course, so yeah, I mean my code runs it.

1365
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,400
A lot of games certainly in the thousands.

1366
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,500
I would say at this point between granny and big to ya in the

1367
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,100
thousands

1368
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:53,400
if you were a software programmer her, how many apps could you have

1369
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,400
done in the same amount of

1370
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,300
Time you have put into this of handmade hero.

1371
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:07,600
Well, you know, we haven't put that much time in so 80 hours 80 hours

1372
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,700
isn't that much?

1373
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,500
It depends on what you mean by app right?

1374
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:16,800
Like you know and it depends on what quality level you're talking

1375
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:17,400
about, right?

1376
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:20,100
I mean you're talking about slap slapping together.

1377
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,800
Some little thing that shows your Twitter feed and you're just going

1378
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,500
to like you know, you know call some pre

1379
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:29,400
Library code to put it up there, whatever you could probably kick out

1380
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,100
a lot of those, right?

1381
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:33,100
Because they're not really doing anything and they're kind of slow and

1382
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,600
bulky and whatever, right?

1383
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,200
But if you're talking about making something really good, you know,

1384
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,300
are you talking about like a cool pink package or something?

1385
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,500
Well, we probably wouldn't gotten very far in that, you know.

1386
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,100
So it's hard to say

1387
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,200
hard to say.

1388
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,800
Will there be water and how would it affect movement?

1389
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,800
So I think we probably should have some water.

1390
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,900
Maybe I don't know how it would affect movement because I don't really

1391
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,500
I don't super love swimming in games.

1392
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:10,600
So I don't know if I'd be inclined to add water but it's worth noting.

1393
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:13,100
I hadn't been thinking about what our I've been thinking the game is

1394
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:16,400
mostly like maybe it has some impassable water, like the water is just

1395
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,700
something you can't go across.

1396
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,000
So it's just a it's just another type of wall that looks prettier

1397
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:21,400
right.

1398
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:25,800
That's how I have been thinking about water, but thinking about it

1399
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,200
more carefully.

1400
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:31,200
It is true that now that we're going with this sort of in and out box,

1401
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,500
thing we could Define some of these boxes to be water in which case

1402
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:41,500
you would like to sink in them and you could swim, I don't know.

1403
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:47,300
It's a good question, I'm not sure about the water situation so maybe

1404
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,700
I want to add that to the to do list.

1405
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,100
I'm going to add that to the to list because I haven't thought about

1406
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:51,600
it but we've kind

1407
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:58,100
And of added something now where you know where we have water in here?

1408
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,800
Let's see.

1409
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,900
Air water that you can swim in maybe with currents to that kind of

1410
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,600
pull you along.

1411
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,700
I don't know, could be interesting, could be interesting.

1412
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,500
To the system used for the ground.

1413
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,900
Now make it harder to have things like moving platforms.

1414
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:22,400
The player can stand on.

1415
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,400
I don't think so because that would probably just be a moving entity

1416
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:33,100
and so, you know, if we wanted to do that, I'll add that as well.

1417
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,300
While we're all, since I already have it up moving platforms, the

1418
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:39,400
player can stand on will add that in there.

1419
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,400
Just as a thing when we do our Collision sector, as a good test of the

1420
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,200
Collision system.

1421
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,400
I don't know how much of that I want to actually have in the game, but

1422
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,800
I could totally just just show how to do it, right?

1423
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,100
Because we should our engine should support it.

1424
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:51,500
Actually

1425
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,800
Was the use of calculus involved in your programming.

1426
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,700
Actually, the use of calculus happened on the stream.

1427
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:05,800
In fact, if you would like to see calculus used in programming, you

1428
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:11,300
can actually go to the video archive, and you can go back to the day

1429
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:17,100
called equations of motion, and you can actually see us do a bunch of

1430
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:21,300
calculus on there, and I'm not very good at calculus, so it's not

1431
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,700
going to be very good calculus, but here it is day 43.

1432
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,000
The

1433
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:30,100
Of motion that is calculus going on right there.

1434
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,000
I believe.

1435
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:43,900
For this game.

1436
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,500
Will the room geometries need to overlap in order to move between

1437
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:46,700
rooms?

1438
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:47,500
Or can they just a?

1439
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,700
But that's what I was wondering too.

1440
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:55,900
They should technically just be able to abut and it'll be fine but it

1441
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,600
depends on exactly how we write the wall intersection code to handle

1442
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,000
them.

1443
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,300
And so it may be that to make our lives easier mathematically

1444
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,800
speaking, so that we can be sloppier in that code.

1445
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,200
We may just want them to be slightly overlapping, right?

1446
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:12,600
And so

1447
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,600
I don't know the answer to your question yet.

1448
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,200
We shall see.

1449
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,200
We shall see.

1450
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,000
Can you illustrate how they do the level editors World layouts in

1451
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,900
modern engines?

1452
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,400
Now

1453
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:37,500
Um not really because honestly the very latest ones I have no

1454
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,400
experience with.

1455
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,600
So like for example

1456
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:47,200
in, you know, in like how does frostbite currently do their level at

1457
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,000
out or Snowdrop or whatever it's called?

1458
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,800
I don't really know and those are the two most recent engines, right?

1459
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,200
Frostbite 3 or something like this snowdrops, very recent as well.

1460
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,900
Unreal and unity are obviously pretty.

1461
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
At this point and presumably have a lot of legacy and how they Define

1462
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:03,300
things.

1463
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,000
So I don't know how those guys necessarily do it.

1464
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,900
I can't tell you that in the witness.

1465
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,800
It's essentially a, a geometry instancing, kind of a thing where

1466
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:19,600
people make meshes in Maya, or, you know, a 3D 3D package.

1467
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,200
Basically.

1468
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,800
And then we, we basically have a world editing tool where you bringing

1469
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,800
those messages in and you place them to construct the world

1470
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,700
All right, so there is no notion of solid space.

1471
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,300
There is no notion of constructive, knowledge is just polygon soups

1472
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,500
that gets slammed together and then the way that you determine, where

1473
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,800
you can walk is by having essentially meshes that are marked as

1474
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,500
walkable.

1475
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,500
And those are things you're allowed to move along.

1476
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,700
That's, that's how it's done.

1477
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,600
But I don't know how similar that is to some of the newer engines out

1478
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,600
there because I haven't that work with them directly.

1479
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,300
Are you going to use files to store levels if so, will they be custom

1480
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:13,100
format?

1481
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,400
We probably will sort of end up storing levels.

1482
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,300
But if we when you save the game,

1483
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:26,300
And yes it's all obviously custom format because we're not using a

1484
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:26,800
library.

1485
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,500
So I guess.

1486
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,500
You mean we we starting like XML like no we want something to be fast.

1487
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,800
Will the combat algorithm in a 2-D game?

1488
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,300
Differ from a 3D game.

1489
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,900
Well, it depends on what you mean by combat algorithm, you have to be

1490
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,300
more specific about what you're talking about.

1491
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,800
Some of it might be the same.

1492
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,000
Some of it might be very different depending on what part of what

1493
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,800
algorithm and what combat mean to you.

1494
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:52,500
In this case,

1495
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:07,200
Let's see how can I work with other programmers?

1496
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,000
When our coding Styles Clash?

1497
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,900
Well, I don't know.

1498
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,400
I mean what do you mean by your coding Styles Clash?

1499
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:23,100
Are you talking about like they want everything to be super

1500
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,500
object-oriented and you want everything to be Super C style or

1501
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,200
something like this.

1502
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,900
If that's the case I would say yeah it's probably going to be pretty

1503
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:29,500
rough.

1504
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,300
You'd probably try to divide things so that

1505
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:36,500
You carve off very specific separate chunks of the code and don't

1506
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,900
really work on the parts of the other person's working on.

1507
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,200
If you just talking about like, they don't like having lines be more

1508
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,900
than 80 characters and I do or something.

1509
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,100
Then just like, you know, everyone just get over it right?

1510
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,000
Just deal with it.

1511
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:52,100
It's not that big of a deal because it doesn't really affect things.

1512
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,000
So, depends what you mean by coding Styles?

1513
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,100
It can be a big problem or it can be not that big of a problem.

1514
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,200
Should there be walls around stairwells now or will we still just used

1515
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,700
to Collision rules from before?

1516
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,600
I don't know what we'll do exactly.

1517
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,900
But we won't have to add walls around.

1518
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:18,200
Stairwells will just have stairwells be in boxes in such essentially

1519
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,000
probably that do a little bit better Collision detection than regular

1520
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,200
boxes because to account for the ramp area

1521
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,700
Are you going to procedure to build levels or predefined levels their

1522
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,700
procedurally built?

1523
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,400
The whole game will be procedural for the most part, except for the

1524
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,200
art, which is obviously hand drawing.

1525
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,800
Will we see stuff like light sources rate racing surface mapping Etc.

1526
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,700
At some point in the Stream you have to be more sit about what surface

1527
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,200
mapping means.

1528
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,200
That's a pretty ambiguous term.

1529
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,700
Light source is definitely yes Ray tracing it depends on what you mean

1530
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,300
by that.

1531
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,100
If you're talking about runtime sparse voxel, octree, tracing or

1532
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,600
runtime KD tracing?

1533
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,700
No, probably not.

1534
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:12,100
If you're talking about rate, receipt Racing for other reasons,

1535
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:12,800
possibly,

1536
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,400
Have we started doing Collision detection and handling?

1537
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:30,900
Yeah, that's how our guy runs into the trees right now.

1538
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,200
I don't understand the question.

1539
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:37,100
Yes, we've done a bunch of work on collision detection.

1540
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:40,500
We have not tried to write the final Collision detector yet, but we

1541
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,800
have one in there that's running at the moment.

1542
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,600
What do you think about storing game data in code?

1543
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:52,900
I think it's fine.

1544
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,700
There are some obvious things you have to be aware of if you do it.

1545
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:07,300
Obviously, it can't be paged in very efficiently so you can't store

1546
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:08,900
very much data in code.

1547
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,500
Like I wouldn't recommend storing a lot of data in code.

1548
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:19,600
It is harder to deal with edits when the data lives in the code, if

1549
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,700
you want to have gooey editing of that data.

1550
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:26,200
You can still do it and I have done it.

1551
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:32,000
What you do is you put the code in its own C file and you have the GUI

1552
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,300
editor, rewrite, the C file and it works pretty well, but it also

1553
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:39,600
often end up being more trouble than it's worth.

1554
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:43,800
So it's, you know, it's six of one half dozen of the other.

1555
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,700
I don't have strong feelings about it other than I would say no the

1556
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:50,100
advantages and disadvantages before you go that route.

1557
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,500
Proton gaming.

1558
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,200
So will you continue complaining about Windows while making money

1559
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,100
programming with it and visual studio?

1560
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:07,500
Yes, of course.

1561
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:12,800
I'm not sure, I understand the nature of the question per se.

1562
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:19,900
I guess, what I would say is, it's, it's sort of an unfortunate mental

1563
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,200
trap that people fall into that, they believe that somehow complaining

1564
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,400
about something is, like, problematic and that if you use something

1565
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:30,300
that you shouldn't be complaining about it, but the opposite is

1566
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:30,700
actually true.

1567
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:31,200
Right?

1568
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:36,200
One of the reasons that Windows is getting worse is because the people

1569
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,100
who are, you know, in a position

1570
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,200
Going to do something about it, aren't complaining about it enough,

1571
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,500
right there, not seeing the negatives in the thing that they're doing

1572
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:50,900
and really seeing the negatives and things is what makes someone a

1573
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:51,500
good engineer?

1574
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:55,500
Most of the time seeing the positives is almost useless in

1575
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,400
engineering, right?

1576
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,900
Like seeing whether the thing you made is really good, doesn't help

1577
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,600
you because all that tells you is what you've already accomplished.

1578
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,800
But what you've already accomplished is not actionable.

1579
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:14,100
I can't do anything about the stuff that's already done, right?

1580
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,300
It's done.

1581
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:16,300
It is what it is.

1582
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,800
So, what I need to be able to see is I need to be able to see the

1583
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:19,600
problems.

1584
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:26,100
And there definitely is this sort of there are really like, I guess

1585
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:27,100
they're probably too mentalities.

1586
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,800
I think both are very harmful for the Improvement of software.

1587
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:33,100
One is the one you're evincing with the question, which is, you know,

1588
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,500
suggesting that maybe the fact that you make money by working on a

1589
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,200
platform.

1590
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,800
Means, you shouldn't be complaining about it.

1591
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,500
Making sense the platform that you are making money on.

1592
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,100
Is the one you should be complaining about the loudest because that's

1593
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,700
the one that's your livelihood, you should care.

1594
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:51,700
The most about the platform that you're making the money on, and you

1595
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:56,100
should be as upset as you could possibly be about problems with that

1596
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:59,300
platform because that is the risk the real risk to you.

1597
01:25:59,300 --> 01:25:59,900
Right.

1598
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:00,800
In some sense.

1599
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,600
It's no skin off my back.

1600
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,900
If Linux never gets any better, right?

1601
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:06,300
I don't make any money.

1602
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,700
Well, I mean, maybe I make a little bit of money off, selling things.

1603
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,000
I'm going to

1604
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,900
So I guess that rad maybe we sold some Linux licenses, right?

1605
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,600
So I didn't maybe maybe I had a little bit of skin in that game at one

1606
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,100
point but I have very little skin in that game right now, right?

1607
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,700
And so it makes very little sense for me to spend a lot of time

1608
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,900
complaining about things that are wrong with Linux and hoping that

1609
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:27,900
people will listen and fix them or to try and Garner momentum around

1610
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,800
changing the prevailing attitudes about something that Linux is doing.

1611
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,400
It doesn't make sense for me to spend a lot of time doing that.

1612
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,200
Because at the end of the day, I yeah, might have lost in that game,

1613
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,200
windows iot on us.

1614
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,100
Getting that kid, that's where people buy games.

1615
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:39,400
Ames.

1616
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,700
And so the thing that I need to complain about the loudest and what

1617
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:46,900
everyone should complain about the last is the things that Windows is

1618
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,500
doing very poorly and it's increasingly doing more and more things

1619
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,600
poorly, right?

1620
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,300
And so this notion that somehow you should be quiet about it because

1621
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,400
you are using it.

1622
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,700
It doesn't really make any sense.

1623
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:59,800
And you know, I don't want to

1624
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,900
Dismiss of your question but honestly yeah it's sort of the attitude

1625
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:10,200
behind the question is is not only I think wrongheaded but also

1626
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:15,600
somewhat harmful in terms of, you know, if you want to get quality

1627
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,300
software at the end of the day, right?

1628
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,200
And so that the other one that I see happen, a lot which is, which is

1629
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:21,900
problematic

1630
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:28,400
Is this sort of notion that like, if you're going to complain about

1631
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,800
something, you should be doing something to fix it and that makes

1632
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,000
doesn't make any sense either.

1633
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:32,600
Right?

1634
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,100
If someone is literally sitting around, not writing any code ever.

1635
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,500
I totally understand, right?

1636
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,700
It's like if you're just sitting around all day and you don't write

1637
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:45,500
any code, you're browsing Facebook and you're doing whatever, right?

1638
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:52,300
Then yes, if you go and say get sucks and someone says, well why don't

1639
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,300
you go fix it?

1640
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,600
Totally makes sense, right?

1641
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:55,400
Makes perfect sense.

1642
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,000
You're not doing anything right now.

1643
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,900
Nobody needs to go read the buzzfeed's, the top 10 cutest cats or

1644
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:02,300
whatever.

1645
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:03,400
And that's what you were going to do.

1646
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,200
So why don't you go take a look at how to see if you can.

1647
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:09,300
I mean, not get up, get and see if you can fix it right?

1648
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,500
Makes perfect sense.

1649
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,000
On the other hand, if you're already someone who's working on a lot of

1650
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,400
code trying to make better software trying,

1651
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,500
Do useful stuff.

1652
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,100
And you complain about something.

1653
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,900
It doesn't make any sense to tell that person.

1654
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,100
Why don't they go fix it?

1655
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:30,100
It's like, it can't be that person's job to fix everything, right?

1656
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,900
They can't be expected to go fix everything.

1657
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:37,300
Somebody is working on get and those people should pay attention to

1658
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,100
the complaints that people have about.

1659
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:43,600
Get not tell them that they shouldn't be complaining about it, right?

1660
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,700
Complaints are valuable.

1661
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,100
They are the most valuable thing that you have in software.

1662
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,200
They

1663
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:53,500
Tell you what's broken and the concept that you would want people not

1664
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:57,500
to voice those concerns, simply because they don't have time to go fix

1665
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,400
whatever the thing is, they're complaining about makes no sense.

1666
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,600
That works for nobody.

1667
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,200
All that does, is it lets a bunch of people go around feeling better

1668
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,000
about themselves.

1669
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,400
And if we all want to have a little kindergarten where we Pat

1670
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,900
ourselves on the back and we feel real good about yourself the other

1671
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:13,700
day, good job Windows, you did great with 8.1 if that's the world you

1672
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,600
want to live in, I understand.

1673
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:16,200
Okay right?

1674
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,500
I understand why we would want to stop complaining.

1675
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,600
If the world you actually want to see is one where the software isn't

1676
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:25,600
awful, then the complaints are in some sense.

1677
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,900
The price we have to pay is feeling a little bit bad about what we did

1678
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:33,500
because it was lousy, that's important, right.

1679
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,800
We have to do that that feeling that we didn't do a good job.

1680
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:42,100
It's important to make us do a better job next time and it happens

1681
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,000
even in the small like on handmade hero.

1682
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,600
I don't want to sit around telling myself.

1683
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,100
I did a good job on this Collision Vector.

1684
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,700
This isn't a good Collision of sector.

1685
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,100
We have a

1686
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,500
Out of work to do on this.

1687
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,000
And we should feel that way, right?

1688
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:57,100
And until we get it toward, we can't see any more serious defects.

1689
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,800
We shouldn't be stopping working on it, and we shouldn't be

1690
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,200
We shouldn't be feeling like we did some kind of great job, right?

1691
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,900
That's not the way things work in my opinion.

1692
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,700
So with that, I think that's probably a good thing to end the topic on

1693
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,600
if that makes sense.

1694
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,200
So yeah,

1695
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,600
I'll see if there's any last-minute ones.

1696
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,200
Let's see.

1697
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,900
Think there doesn't seem to be any one thing left.

1698
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,200
Can even name the stream to KC's little kindergarten.

1699
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,700
No, because I'm not going to tell everyone that it was a great job and

1700
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,400
we should feel great about ourselves so it probably wouldn't be good

1701
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,300
to call it Casey's little kindergarten, but there could be a stream

1702
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,300
where that's the case.

1703
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:51,800
But yeah.

1704
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:53,500
So let's say

1705
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,500
One day, you said you lost.

1706
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,200
Hope in Microsoft but now you can play in so they can fix it.

1707
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,900
Well, no, that's not exactly what I said, but, yes, that's true.

1708
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,600
I don't have any hope in Microsoft.

1709
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,600
I don't think they're actually going to be able to fix.

1710
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:12,800
I don't think they're listening is basically what I think, right?

1711
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:16,200
But that doesn't mean I'm not still going to try, right?

1712
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,700
Like that doesn't mean that I'm not going to say here's all the stuff

1713
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:19,400
that's broken.

1714
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,700
Case you want to know, right?

1715
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:24,700
If anyone ever does start to listen, then they could fix it, right.

1716
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,200
But do I have hope that they're going to know?

1717
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,800
But I don't have hope in a lot of things like there's a lot of things

1718
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:36,900
I don't have hope for but I still you know I'm not going to not still

1719
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:38,200
do the thing right do?

1720
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,900
Do I have hope that the world won't run out of water?

1721
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,100
Do I have you know hope that we're going to have a sensible solution

1722
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,000
to our world's energy things?

1723
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:47,600
No.

1724
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,800
But I still recycle and I still walk to work.

1725
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,400
I still do the right thing, even though I'm not optimistic that it's

1726
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,400
going to have.

1727
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,900
Happy ending, right?

1728
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,500
So I realized your kind of trolling and that's fine.

1729
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:05,200
You know, people people kind of have certain things but but your

1730
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,600
question actually does have a real answer, right?

1731
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,200
And so for people who are actually interested in the answer and not

1732
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,200
the trolling, it is true that just because you don't think that

1733
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:19,200
something will work out, doesn't necessarily mean that you should stop

1734
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,400
taking the positive action, whatever that thing is, right.

1735
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,800
And so, if you've just said, you know what this suffer is

1736
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,200
Not going to its, you know, I've lost faith in this company.

1737
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:35,200
I don't think that they're ever going to be delivering something that

1738
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,900
we can use.

1739
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,300
That doesn't mean you shouldn't keep pointing it out but doesn't mean

1740
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:40,300
that you shouldn't be there.

1741
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:41,200
Going look.

1742
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:47,400
This stuff is still broken just so everyone knows it is broken because

1743
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:49,100
you never do know, right?

1744
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:50,400
It could turn around.

1745
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,200
And the sad fact of the matter is, we are stuck with the operating

1746
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:54,500
systems.

1747
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:57,900
We are stuck with, you know, it's Linux Windows and Mac right now, and

1748
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,500
there's not a lot of

1749
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,900
There's not a lot on the horizon that's other than those things.

1750
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,300
And maybe the market share of those things will vary whatever.

1751
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:06,700
But that's what we're stuck with right now.

1752
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:10,600
And so barring, some fairly big changes in the market going forwards.

1753
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,900
We kind of have to still keep taking whatever, positive action we can.

1754
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,900
Because at the end of the day,

1755
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,600
we don't have a lot of options.

1756
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,200
Am I hopeful for the future?

1757
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,900
No, I mean, to become the house with, you know, I'm not hopeful.

1758
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,800
That Microsoft will ever ship a good operating system.

1759
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:31,100
Again, I literally have almost no hope that they will do that.

1760
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,500
I have a desire for them to do that.

1761
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:35,300
I want them to do that.

1762
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:41,500
I want them to turn back into the company, they were in 1990, but you

1763
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,400
know, do I think is going to happen now.

1764
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:48,800
I think there's almost no chance, but I'll keep on saying it and you

1765
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,000
never know, maybe,

1766
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,600
Someday, they will hard say.

1767
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,800
Was getting example, or do you feel?

1768
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,600
There are problems with it, curious to hear?

1769
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:03,400
No, it was just an example.

1770
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:10,700
I, I don't use get, so I don't have any strong opinions like,

1771
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,700
basically sorts of control, I use my own.

1772
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:18,300
I'm sure I would have some issues with philosophically.

1773
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:21,200
How get things does things maybe but I don't know.

1774
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,900
I think maybe I'm sure did is probably good for what it does.

1775
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,800
A lot of people use it seem to like it so it must have a certain

1776
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,600
philosophy that works well for them, from what I've seen of it.

1777
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,800
It doesn't seem to be the way I would do things, but that's not really

1778
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,800
something I necessarily complain about because typically the things

1779
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,800
that bother me are when something isn't working properly or isn't made

1780
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,000
well, right?

1781
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,100
I don't tend to complain when something isn't the thing that I want it

1782
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:48,800
to be right?

1783
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,400
Like I'm not going to go complain that a you know, certain paint.

1784
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,900
M doesn't allow me to do you know, natural media painting if that's

1785
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,800
not what that paint program does right like guess it's you know,

1786
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,200
different products and different spaces and so, yeah.

1787
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,800
So I don't have any problem with get, I don't use it.

1788
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,300
I don't know.

1789
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,100
It could be great.

1790
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,000
It could be awful.

1791
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,900
I have no idea.

1792
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,300
I kind of randomly set it because I was kind of in my head that

1793
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,700
everyone always says switch to get.

1794
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,900
They say it to John, blow all the time.

1795
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:21,000
When he talks about source, code control things switch to get, is that

1796
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,300
common thing that people say,

1797
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:25,700
And so, I think I just said it because of the switch to get thing, but

1798
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:29,300
the switch to get thing is not really has nothing to do with this.

1799
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:29,800
That's it.

1800
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,900
So, yeah, I have no complaints with get, I don't even use it.

1801
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:37,600
I don't know if it's good or bad and so yeah, what can I say?

1802
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:39,800
so,

1803
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,700
So I think that's about it.

1804
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,500
I'm going to I'm going to call it there, doesn't look like there's, we

1805
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:51,500
didn't have too many on-topic questions today anyway so I don't think

1806
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,600
we like missed anything there.

1807
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:56,800
So I'm going to go ahead and wrap things up.

1808
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,300
We will close it down.

1809
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:01,700
And here we go.

1810
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:03,500
Okay.

1811
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,700
So, thank you everyone for joining for another game for another game.

1812
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:10,200
That's good for another episode of handmade hero.

1813
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,700
It's been a pleasure coding with you, as always.

1814
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And yet we had pretty off-topic questions tonight, that's just how it

1815
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,600
goes sometimes.

1816
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,900
I guess, what do you do if you don't have on-topic questions, you

1817
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,500
answer, off-topic ones but I'm pretty happy with the actual

1818
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,500
programming we did because basically, you know, we didn't have a whole

1819
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,000
lot of time to do code.

1820
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,700
But we did sort of work through what I think is a reasonable solution

1821
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,100
in terms of how we're going to handle our move.

1822
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:37,700
Moving in terms of our definition of where like the ground is and

1823
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,200
stuff like that and so I'm pretty optimistic that that'll let things.

1824
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,300
Get cleaned up a little bit in the cliff Schecter, let the notion of

1825
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,100
ground work a little bit better.

1826
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,400
And you know I like when we make that kind of forward progress, so I'm

1827
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,000
pretty happy with that and hopefully you'll be interested in coming

1828
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,700
back tomorrow.

1829
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,300
It'll be a morning swim tomorrow.

1830
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,400
9 a.m.

1831
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,000
I believe is on the schedule.

1832
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:03,500
And so that will be when will actually go through and Implement that

1833
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,800
in box, checking in the Collision Vector, which will allow us to kind

1834
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,700
of get that sort of ground testing that we wanted to have happen on

1835
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,800
the actual Collision stuff.

1836
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,200
So right now all we're doing is we're adding those entities but we

1837
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,000
haven't actually done the work.

1838
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,900
Text check against them so that is what we'll be doing tomorrow.

1839
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:22,200
I hope you'll join me for that.

1840
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,300
If you want to follow along at home, you can always pre-order the game

1841
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,700
on handmade hero dot org.

1842
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:29,500
And

1843
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:34,000
That gives you access to the source code so you can download it and

1844
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,300
you can follow along with everything we do which is kind of a fun way

1845
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,000
to learn from the stream.

1846
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,100
If you're interested in that.

1847
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:39,800
We also have a patreon page and subscribe to.

1848
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,100
If you're interested in supporting the series, we have a news and

1849
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:46,600
Forum site where you can ask questions and you can access resources

1850
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,400
that people have from.

1851
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,300
You need to put together like ports to Linux and mac and episode

1852
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:50,500
guide.

1853
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:51,400
That's pretty awesome.

1854
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:57,000
We also have a tweetbot newly updated to say whether it's pacific

1855
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,500
daylight time or Civic Standard Time

1856
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,300
So it's even Daylight Savings Time aware now.

1857
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:03,700
We don't know how long that'll last.

1858
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,600
It's kind of a, you know, it was kind of a very quick project I hack

1859
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,000
together.

1860
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,400
I don't claim it to be particularly.

1861
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,900
Well, engineered, let's be honest with that.

1862
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,300
But anyway, if you do want to check out that tweetbot, it tweets the

1863
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:13,800
schedule you.

1864
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:16,600
So if you want to follow along with a series that's a good way to make

1865
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,900
sure you always know when it is.

1866
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,400
In addition to kind of like, you know, you can subscribe on Twitch but

1867
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,000
that tells me tells you when I go live.

1868
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,800
It doesn't necessarily tell you when I'm going to go live right in the

1869
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,100
future.

1870
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:28,000
So that's pretty handy.

1871
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:31,700
So I hope you'll check those out, and I hope you'll join me tomorrow

1872
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:35,700
at 9 a.m., but either way, have a wonderful Friday and I will see you

1873
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,100
guys on the next ring.
