1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Start crying and now we can begin now that I'm sure that there is no

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,700
little snafu there.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,300
Hello, everyone and welcome to handmade hero.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,800
The show where we coded complete game live on the interwebs using

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,500
absolutely nothing.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,700
No engine.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,400
No Library, we program everything ourselves from scratch as basically

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,300
both for education purposes and for just for fun, honestly, because I

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,600
like coding things from scratch.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,700
And so today we have something

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Fairly important that we have to tackle actually.

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
So I don't want to waste too much time before we get right into it.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,300
So I will simply say if you are following along with the code and you

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,100
have pre-ordered the game on handmade here at org.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,800
You should have gotten a link in your email in that link.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,500
There is a ZIP file and in the zip file, there is ipps for every

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,300
single day.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,700
You want to unzip day 42 source code because it's day 43 right now.

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,700
And we always start with the previous day's source code.

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,200
So if you unzip that into a director somewhere, then you can start

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,500
coding.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,600
Exactly where I am coding.

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,800
Now and so you should be able to follow along precisely.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,800
So let's go ahead and get started.

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,300
Like I said, on the, when I post it on Twitter today, what we're

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,600
supposed to do today is we are actually supposed to get ourselves a

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,500
little bit closer towards having some good player movement code.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,000
By taking a look at the equations of motion, which are basically the

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
physics that underlie how real things in the world move, understanding

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400
them, and then figuring out exactly what part of them we want to use,

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
or what we want to do in order to

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,600
To create something that feels good to play which is not always the

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,200
same as making something physically, realistic.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Usually what you want to do in a lot of scenarios is you want to kind

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,000
of know what the physically correct thing would be because the right

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,800
thing to do gameplay-wise is often close to that thing or has a lot of

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,900
the properties of that thing because people's brains are obviously

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
attuned to work.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,200
The way physics works.

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
And to think about things the way physics works is what they have

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
experienced with.

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,400
But it is also often the case that you don't really want a perfect,

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
physical simulation, most of the time,

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Because we want to kind of go more towards what's fun to control not,

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,200
what would be accurate, right?

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
We're not trying to make a simulation here.

48
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,200
Some games are trying to be simulation e, and those games should care

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,300
a lot about how accurate their physics are.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,200
But in our particular case, we're more concerned just with the how the

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,100
player, how sort of the that hero character feels to move around.

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,300
And so in that case, what we really want to do is just kind of know

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,000
what the equations of motion are in the real world and then go ahead

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,900
and take the opportunity to sort of like

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,400
I'm a little and makeup except some equations of motion that are

56
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,400
whatever we think, feels the best just from playing with it.

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
And I don't even know exactly what those are going to be ahead of

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,100
time.

59
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,500
Right?

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,200
We're going to, we're going to, we're going to see by sort of just

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,700
trial and error.

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,300
What we end up thinking is the most interesting way to have our

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
character be controlled.

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,600
Now, if you remember yesterday, what we did is we started replacing

65
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,200
things with a vector structure that we have.

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,800
We actually turned it into, just at the end of the stream, we turned

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:02:59,900
it.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,700
You're a union.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,000
It's basically just this right here and all it is is it's an XY pair,

70
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,500
right?

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,200
Like that.

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,900
And we then then went ahead and made all of our code kind of start

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,800
working with that XY pairs kind of sucking that up a little bit in.

74
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,000
So make made a lot of things that were verbose a little bit more

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,800
straightforward, and we didn't actually spend the time because we kind

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
of got to little late in the Stream to actually condense everything

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
that we could have condensed.

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,800
Certainly we still left a fair number of things in scalar.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,600
ER or even though we were doing them in Vector, maybe still left the

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,000
math as two separate things 14, X and Y, and that sort of stuff.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
So we haven't done too much work in, that's our code but we did a

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,100
little and I don't really want to go crazy with that right now because

83
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,700
we can always do that later and there's really no particular need to

84
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,500
change working code at any particular time.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,800
So rather what what I'd like to do now is just kind of concentrate on

86
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,000
this.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,900
Can't this player P thing here.

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Maybe, we'll think about looking at the camera for you as well.

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
But this player P is basically something that we had which is just

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,800
saying here is where the player.

91
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,700
Actually is in the world and what I'd like to do is start thinking

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,300
about that in terms of how we want to modify it and how we can make it

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,600
feel a little bit better.

94
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,800
So if we actually run the game and just look at what the game has

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
right now, you can see that the character motion.

96
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
We talked about this already.

97
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Just does not feel particularly good its kind of As you move around

98
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
you just kind of feel like it's you know, it's just the most basic

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,400
thing.

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,600
It just kind of it stops instantly.

101
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,700
It doesn't have any kind of acceleration or anything to it or any

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,400
field are, it doesn't have any momentum.

103
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
So when I Let Go it just kind of stops immediately.

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,100
It just and there's really no, there's nothing good, really about the

105
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,600
feel of this particular about this.

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,000
And so what I want to do is start to fix that by.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,100
Let's just, you know, just kind of adding in some basic stuff, give it

108
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
a little bit of that momentum.

109
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,100
Give it a little bit of that.

110
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,600
Like it accelerate and decelerate, just to give it a little bit of

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,200
that feel.

112
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,500
And we don't want too much in that, we don't want a crazy amount of

113
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,100
acceleration and deceleration because we still want the player

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,200
controls to be nice and tight.

115
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,300
This is an action game.

116
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
We don't want the player to feel like

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,900
Super soupy and kind of really hard to like stop where they want to

118
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,500
stop, but I just want to give it a little bit of something.

119
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,100
And so what I want to go over first is just to sort of say, what sort

120
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,200
of the background is here in terms of what what actually happens in

121
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,000
the real world in terms of things that are in motion.

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,300
And so what happens in the real world, right?

123
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,800
If I've got something this is my this is going to be my like a magical

124
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,000
sphere here, you know, maybe it's a magical sphere with a little

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
reflection on it.

126
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,400
It's like a bowling ball or something like that.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
So I've got my little sphere or something.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,500
And, you know, I want to start talking about how this thing moves

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,500
around.

130
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,600
Well, obviously, there's some basic things that happen with any

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,500
physical object in the world.

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,100
One of them is that it is constantly subject to a downward force and

133
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
we all know what that is, right?

134
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,900
That's gravity.

135
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,900
And gravity is a very interesting kind of a force actually, which we

136
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,000
can talk about a little bit more later.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,300
We won't really have to think about it too much for moving the

138
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,800
character because he's not really falling.

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,900
He's always in contact with the

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,200
Out.

141
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,100
And we assume that like the gravitational forces are getting handled

142
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,200
by his little sort of Stumpy legs things that he has under there, that

143
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,900
kind of keep him on the ground or whatever.

144
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,000
But point being everything in the world is constantly under Gravity.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,700
We know this.

146
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,800
So there's always kind of a downward force that that's at play there.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
It's actually more of a gret downward acceleration technically.

148
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
But again, I said, well we can talk think about that a little bit more

149
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,100
later.

150
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,200
We have to worry about too much now and then any time that any object

151
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
is going to move.

152
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:29,900
It's basically

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,400
By the way, in which it moves can be broken down into sort of two

154
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,000
distinct.

155
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,100
I want to say categories or two two things.

156
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to think about when you think about how an object moves.

157
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,500
And, and when I say this, we're talking about basically, I'm going to

158
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,000
just preface this by saying oops.

159
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,700
But this is this is rigid body dynamics that we're talking about here,

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,600
which is specifically talking about sort of the way in which matter in

161
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,700
the world moves.

162
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,200
When you reduce it down to the basic concept of just, let's assume

163
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,900
that all of the atoms and, you know, quantum physics and all that

164
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,500
stuff that makes up my little bowling balls fear thing.

165
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,100
Let's take those out of the picture and just say, if we just assume

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,600
they're all rigidly connected right now, and we're not talking about

167
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,700
what happens when the bulb

168
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,000
Six or what's happening at the molecular level and all these are the

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,200
things we're just talking about how the gross large sort of body that

170
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,300
these things form move around.

171
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,200
There's really two ways that we have to think about that.

172
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,900
One is called linear and the other is called angular, right?

173
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,400
And they are sort of exactly what you would think.

174
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,200
You.

175
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,100
You essentially have to think about how the thing moves around.

176
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,200
So like the path that this thing is taking through space, right?

177
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,400
How is this thing moving?

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,700
That's linear?

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Are the sort of the the linear dynamics of it and, and sort of the

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,500
angular dynamics of it.

181
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Are how it's rotating, right?

182
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Because this thing could spin around, right?

183
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,200
It could do all sorts of things that in that in do sort of like a

184
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,000
rotational motion, even if the thing is sort of standing in one place

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,100
or sort of sitting in one place.

186
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
Now the physics Behind these two, things are not actually different at

187
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,700
the lower levels because again, everything is just a bunch of atoms.

188
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,900
Everything's just a bunch of quarks ever far down.

189
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,000
You want to go and those things all have physics.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,700
That determine how

191
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,900
How they work and they aren't separated into whether the motion of the

192
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,400
atom was about the ball rotating or whether it was about the ball

193
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,000
moving.

194
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,700
So, down at the molecular level.

195
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,600
It's not going to be about what the bowling ball was doing out where

196
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,299
we observe it.

197
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:34,900
Right?

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,900
But in terms of our simulation of it, where we are making this

199
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,000
reduction and saying, we're not thinking about atoms are not thinking

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,600
about any of that stuff.

201
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,500
We're just thinking about it as one sort of gross object, because we

202
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,800
are treating it all as one group like that.

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600
We have to think about both how it moves.

204
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,300
In space and how it spins.

205
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Because those two things are necessary to figure out where all the

206
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,300
atoms actually were, when we go to actually say, okay, where is the

207
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,000
ball now, right.

208
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
So what we're going to do today?

209
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
We're going to focus on this part here.

210
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
We're not going to talk about this part, which is why I picked a

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,100
bowling ball because hey, a sphere.

212
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,700
You don't really care which way it's rotated to some degree.

213
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,400
When terms of how we're going to draw it, so, for just moving around,

214
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,200
I picked something to be nice and easy thing about in that case.

215
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,300
So we're just going to talk about the, the sort of the linear portion

216
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,800
of things.

217
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,100
We're just going to talk about the movement.

218
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,500
And so the movement, basically, we have forces in the world.

219
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,600
That's like, when I go to push on this ball with something, right?

220
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,500
When I, when I hand comes in and I just kind of smack the ball or

221
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,700
something else, hits the ball.

222
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,100
Like another ball comes in here and smacks the ball.

223
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Basically, we have forces that are applied to this.

224
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,800
Object, and those forces.

225
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,400
Are all actually acting for the purposes.

226
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,900
Again of the rigid body Dynamics, sort of way of viewing the world.

227
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,800
You can think about reducing this object in all of its complexity down

228
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
to basically just its Center of mass.

229
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,100
So basically the center of mass which is, which is, if you think about

230
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,700
the, the entire sort, of all the matter, that's in this thing, if you

231
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,000
think about just thinking of where that centered, where all of it, if

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,700
you look at the, the point that basically, if you averaged how out,

233
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,500
how dense it is everywhere in it.

234
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,200
And figured out the center point of all of that density, you would get

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
the center of mass, which is basically a point, which if our sphere

236
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
was uniform, density, would be like right at the center.

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Right?

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,300
And again, a lot of this stuff is stuff that you only care about.

239
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,800
If you start to actually do realistic stuff.

240
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm just mentioning it.

241
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
So you can kind of know what we're talking about.

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,000
Right?

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
So we don't have to think really about densities and masses too much,

244
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
but it's just something, you know, Mass may come up a little bit, but

245
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,000
point being, if you're doing full 3d stuff, you would start to care

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,400
about a lot of this stuff anyway, so what we want to think about is,

247
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
we want to think about all of the

248
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Forces that are applied to our object.

249
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,700
Okay.

250
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,300
So, all of these things that might be pushing on our object, at any

251
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,200
given time the gravitational part of it, the things that are pushing

252
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,000
out, directly impacts, that are happening, those sorts of things, all

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,900
of these things.

254
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,700
We have to consider in terms of figuring out where the center of mass

255
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,900
of our object goes.

256
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,800
And at the end of the day on any given instant.

257
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,800
What we want to do is look at all of these forces and determine due to

258
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,200
all of the forces that are impacting this thing right now.

259
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Where is it going to be pushed?

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,100
What is the net sum total of all of the forces on this thing?

261
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,400
How is it going to be pushed?

262
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,300
Right?

263
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,700
And now there's a very fundamental equation that you probably have

264
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,200
seen before.

265
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,400
If you took High School physics again, it looks like this.

266
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,900
It's f equals Ma.

267
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,900
And what that basically says, is force equals mass times acceleration.

268
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,800
And the reason that I point this out is because forces, which are the

269
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,600
things that push on this ball, right?

270
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Wind could be a force.

271
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,800
Example, you know something directly pushing on the ball gravity.

272
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
Could be a forest on etcetera Etc.

273
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,900
All of them are forces and the degree to which they affect the ball.

274
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,500
Remember the acceleration is what, what determines?

275
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
What's actually going to happen to the ball.

276
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
The acceleration that those four

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Produce is mitigated by the mass, the mass of the, of the of the

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
object that's being moved.

279
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,800
Basically determines how much a for, how much each individual force

280
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,700
will actually affect the object.

281
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,200
Right?

282
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,000
So if we look at what all the forces are and then we want to see how

283
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,100
much those the some of those forces will affect our object.

284
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,200
We have to think about what its mass is and we have to solve this

285
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,600
equation.

286
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Basically, for a, right?

287
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,100
So it's pretty easy, right?

288
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
Because it's just F over, right?

289
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,900
I'll if I want to solve for a all I do is divide by m, and

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
I get F 0, f over m, equals acceleration and that would be the

291
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,900
equation for the acceleration.

292
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,400
So, basically, the heavier object is the less.

293
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
It would move for any Force, right?

294
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,000
Because the M as the M gets bigger, the acceleration goes down for any

295
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,500
given force.

296
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
And that's exactly what you see in the real world.

297
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,700
The heavier, something appears to be to us the harder.

298
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,500
It is to push it.

299
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
That's just the intuitive way to think about this, right?

300
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
There's a lot more involved there.

301
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,700
But you know, that's basically an intuitive way of thinking about it,

302
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,100
right?

303
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,400
And so if I want to start talking about how physics actually works, in

304
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,800
terms of how it affects something like a rigid body, like a bowling

305
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,700
ball or whatever it is or our little guy there.

306
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:07,900
Essentially.

307
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,500
What I want to do is I want to talk about something, all the forces on

308
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,900
him.

309
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,500
I want to talk about Computing, what the acceleration actually is, for

310
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,000
all of those forces combined, right?

311
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,800
And so I do that by figure out what the mass of the guy is and I do my

312
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
divide and I get it, get out and acceleration.

313
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,500
And then again, I have to figure out how to

314
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,900
Relate this acceleration back to a position.

315
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,100
Right?

316
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,000
Because what I want to know at any given time when I need to render

317
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
this bowling ball, or whatever, it's goes, is that we're simulating.

318
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,500
I have to know where in the world it is.

319
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,700
That's like the primary thing.

320
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,600
I need to know in order to be able to display it on the screen.

321
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
It's also the primary thing.

322
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,200
I need to know to be able to do Collision detection or anything else.

323
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,200
I need to know what that is.

324
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,100
And so that's where we get to sort of the the hierarchy that you've

325
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
probably seen before.

326
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,400
Hopefully, but maybe not.

327
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,500
But

328
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,700
And velocity acceleration, right?

329
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,100
And this is what I talk about.

330
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,200
When I say the the fundamental equation of motion, the very the very

331
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
simplest stuff, that moves things around.

332
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,700
It's a hierarchy that looks like this and all of these things are

333
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,500
essentially dependent on time.

334
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,400
Okay, physics is all about what happens to things over time.

335
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,200
And so, when we're talking about when we talk about doing sort of

336
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,000
rigid by an answer for this or anything, sort of the thing, we're

337
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,900
talking about looking at this hierarchy of thing of information about,

338
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,500
you know, one of these

339
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,300
Objects that were moving around or doing whatever to we're talking

340
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,800
about looking.

341
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,300
How these three is quantities.

342
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,500
Change over time.

343
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,300
And these three quantities are all related.

344
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,300
If I want to know, if I say that, I have a function for an object's

345
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,900
position.

346
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,000
Then these three are related.

347
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,100
Very simply the first derivative.

348
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,800
If you remember your high school calculus, the first derivative of the

349
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,700
position is the velocity and the second derivative right of the

350
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
position is the acceleration, okay?

351
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
And so that is, you know, like again, these are just the fundamental

352
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,900
equations that govern.

353
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,400
How things actually work.

354
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,200
Sort of in the simplified representation that allows us to just

355
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,500
consider entire collections of atoms, if you will to act as one.

356
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,300
And so this, it may look a little daunting because I like he's drawing

357
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
these F of T is up here and he's got all this stuff and there's time

358
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,700
and I don't understand what's going on.

359
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,400
This is getting, this is getting confusing, but it's actually

360
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,800
relatively straightforward and I can kind of relate it back to what

361
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,700
we're doing in the code relatively simply.

362
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,300
We already have one of these things in the code, obviously, right?

363
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,000
We already have position because I just pointed that out to you.

364
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,100
That's right here.

365
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,200
That's our player P.

366
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,600
And we know this is our update Loop.

367
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,000
This is how player plea gets updated.

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What were we doing?

369
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:50,800
Right?

370
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,200
We took the player position, we multiplied by however, much time.

371
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,900
We wanted to advance the Delta, the difference like however, you know,

372
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,300
No, the motion basically that we want this guy to take and we added

373
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,000
that into wherever he already was right?

374
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,400
And so, if you think about what that's doing, okay, again, going back

375
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,300
to our sort of vector, representation of things.

376
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,300
If the guy was here, right?

377
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,500
And this is my position.

378
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,400
So, this is my position right here.

379
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
If the guy was here, what were essentially doing?

380
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,600
Is we're saying we have a direction that he's going to go, right?

381
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,200
That's our deep layer right there.

382
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,200
And then we're multiplying that direction by the time by DT for a

383
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:34,500
frame.

384
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:34,600
Now.

385
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
Why did I call it DT?

386
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Why did I call it?

387
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,300
DT?

388
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Well, it stood and I didn't actually say this at the time because we

389
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,800
weren't there yet.

390
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
It stands for delta T tea.

391
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,300
Obviously is time.

392
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:44,900
Delta.

393
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,500
T means the difference in time, right?

394
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,700
It's the difference in time between two points, last frame and a now,

395
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,400
or in our case, since we're doing it slightly differently.

396
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,700
We're actually doing it.

397
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
The difference between the start of the frame and the end of the

398
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,400
frame.

399
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,200
We're looks sort of thinking about it in that sense.

400
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
So we're saying the frame.

401
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,200
The the stuff was here and now it's going there.

402
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,099
And while the frame is up on the screen.

403
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,700
We're Imagining the objects to move from one place to the other over

404
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,500
that time step.

405
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,000
So if we were going to do motion blur or something, it would be across

406
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,599
that time step, if that makes sense.

407
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,000
So, there you go.

408
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,099
So that's actually what we're talking about here.

409
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,900
Right?

410
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,900
And that's what we're doing.

411
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
When we actually do this update.

412
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,800
We're taking a direction.

413
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
We're multiplying it by delta T.

414
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,600
And that's how far we're moving him right now.

415
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,300
Remember, I believe we talked about this a little bit.

416
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:33,400
Now.

417
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
I guess we really talk about this too much.

418
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,100
So I'll mention it today because this is actually relatively

419
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,800
important.

420
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,500
We talked about scalar multiples of vectors, right?

421
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,700
We basically said that if I have a vector, you know, I could multiply

422
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,500
it by some scalar.

423
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,700
Like I've got a vector here, I can multiply it by say to and I would

424
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:48,900
get it.

425
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,300
Vector.

426
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,400
That's twice that length, pointing in the same direction, right?

427
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,300
And I don't think I ever actually said was, you can consider vectors

428
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
as having a magnitude, right?

429
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,900
We could consider vectors as having.

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
Like then we did a bunch of that stuff yesterday.

431
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Remember we were looking the Pythagorean theorem and stuff and we're

432
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,100
looking at how long some of those vectors are.

433
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,600
So basically from here to the tip, you know, from the from the base to

434
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
the tip of the vector, right?

435
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,300
That's a particular length and that we call that the magnitude of the

436
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,400
vector, right?

437
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,000
So you can think of vectors is having a direction, which is sort of

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,100
the line along, which they're appointing and a magnitude.

439
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,900
And that direction is actually signed because it's either pointing

440
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,100
positively or negatively in that sense.

441
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
And then the magnitude you can

442
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,900
Think of, as how long it is in that direction, right?

443
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,100
So that's just something to keep in mind.

444
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,900
So, again, what we were doing, when we were actually Computing, the

445
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,300
update for our guy is we were taking sort of a direction upon a place,

446
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,800
you know, a sort of a line in which we want him to travel, which we

447
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,700
had set up here using what keys were down.

448
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
And then we said, we're going to move him as far along that direction

449
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,700
as there is time in the time, step, right?

450
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,700
However, big the time step was that's how far along the line we're

451
00:18:59,700 --> 00:18:59,900
going.

452
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,400
Move him.

453
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,700
Now the time step of course is in seconds and it's going to be some

454
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,000
fraction.

455
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's going to be .0.

456
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,300
Something s right .03 three seconds or something like that because

457
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
we're at 30 frames a second.

458
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,800
So the amount of time between two frames is a 30th of a second.

459
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,600
So basically what we're doing is we're taking the vector and we're

460
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,300
making, it have magnitude point zero, three, three, if

461
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,900
If the vector was unit magnitude now, the vector isn't actually

462
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,000
necessarily unit magnitude, although I think it always is.

463
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,900
All right.

464
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,400
Yeah, so we always are actually setting that that Vector, you can see

465
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,900
here to be a length of 1, right.

466
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's going to be one - one - one, or one, that's always.

467
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,400
Got one is the magnitude and in the case, where we were going to move

468
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,900
both axes at the same time.

469
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,800
We solve the Pythagorean theorem to see what that distance should have

470
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,000
been in order to reduce it down.

471
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,800
To being the same as it was here, which means this is actually also

472
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
going to produce a vector of length 1 which, which is kind of amusing

473
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,600
when I think about it.

474
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,200
So yeah, okay, but we do do one thing here, right?

475
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,500
We've got one other thing in the mix.

476
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,000
In fact, I think I'll move this down below here, just make clerk.

477
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,100
So then what we do beyond that now that we actually know.

478
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,700
Okay, that's how we now have a vector, that sort of magnitude one.

479
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,300
We then said, we have a speed.

480
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,500
We want the player to go at, which is going to be 2.

481
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,400
Meters per second, right?

482
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Because our world units are meters.

483
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,700
And we're talking about how fast this player is going to m/s.

484
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Or if I have the special magic button down.

485
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
It's 10 meters per second.

486
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,500
And then we were multiplying the vector by that.

487
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,800
So we actually already did another magnitude scale.

488
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,200
Here.

489
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
We took a unit length of vector 1.

490
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,800
That's 1 that's only one unit long and we multiplied it by this to get

491
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
a vector which is that long.

492
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
It's going to be a vector.

493
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
That's two units longer 10 units long, depending on how far depending

494
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,500
on whether that button was downright.

495
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
and then when we actually go to move the player we multiply that total

496
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,800
vector by however, which is

497
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Right here by however, much time we want to advance.

498
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,700
So this is essentially this.

499
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,200
That means this Vector, if you think about what its units are, this

500
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,100
Vector is the amount that the player would move in one second because

501
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,600
we're multiplying by fractions of a second, right?

502
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,000
So what were essentially doing here is this is meters per second,

503
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,500
right?

504
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,100
We're multiplying by S and just getting meters out, right?

505
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,400
Again, dimensional analysis.

506
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,500
So these are meters per second units.

507
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,300
If that makes sense.

508
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,900
This isn't S.

509
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
And so outcomes.

510
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Second.

511
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,100
And again, we've kind of been sneaky about it here because we never

512
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,200
really came right out and said it.

513
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,800
But we were basically doing is we were doing all that essentially with

514
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,700
Vector math.

515
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,600
We were saying, we want to make a vector.

516
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,900
That's going to represent his movement and we want to represent the

517
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,500
movement cleanly.

518
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,100
So we can just say meters per second, which you'll note doesn't have a

519
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
direction to it.

520
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,200
This is just 10 meters per second in some direction and we let the

521
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,600
fact that we have a unit Vector pointing in the correct direction.

522
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,800
Tell us how

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Construct, the motion in X & Y, that actually corresponds to this

524
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,200
speed.

525
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,000
Along that line, right?

526
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,800
I know it's a little confusing, but I just thought I'd point that out

527
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,500
just really briefly.

528
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,300
Okay, so we can go over this again in the Q&A.

529
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,100
If it's, if it's complicated know, there's a lot of Concepts here but

530
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
point being that's what's happening.

531
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,500
Right?

532
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,600
We're basically taking a position where we're starting where we've got

533
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,300
a direction and then we're trying to make the magnitude of our

534
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,500
resulting Vector, that we're going to move by P.

535
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,600
Proportional, both to how much time has elapsed and how fast the

536
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,500
player is going.

537
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,500
So we have a speed in meters per second.

538
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,800
We have a time in seconds, the S cross in dimensional analysis.

539
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,100
Remember.

540
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,200
So they get they go away.

541
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,700
And we're left with just the m.

542
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,500
We advance the guy by the meters.

543
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,600
And again, it's all in Vector.

544
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,400
So it's got a direction.

545
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,600
It knows what direction is going and it knows how far to go and boom,

546
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,300
we go, we get to our new position.

547
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,800
That's what we were already doing.

548
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,200
Now.

549
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
What is actually going on there?

550
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,400
Right?

551
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,600
What we know that position is measured in meters.

552
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,500
We already said that, right?

553
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,000
We already said that position is in meters.

554
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
Well, what is this meters per second, right?

555
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,200
So we did s we crossed out s.

556
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Right.

557
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
We basically said, let me write this equation.

558
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,500
Actually explicitly over here.

559
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,600
We actually said, right?

560
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,200
We said we have Delta t, s times whatever.

561
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,900
Our player motion is so our player motion amount, you know, motion or

562
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,700
whatever you want to call.

563
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,500
It meters per second, write like this.

564
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,500
And I crossed out those seconds and I got meters, but what was this

565
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,600
sort of motion m/s.

566
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,100
Weird value that we were multiplying here.

567
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,800
We know this is a Time step, right?

568
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
We know delta T seconds is the time step.

569
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
But what was this nonsense over here?

570
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,400
Well, that's actually the velocity right meters per second.

571
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,300
It's how many meters somebody goes in a second and that is exactly

572
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,600
what we were doing right here.

573
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,100
We were actually doing a velocity based update of the position of our

574
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
our guy, we computed the

575
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,300
To be deep layer, which is either a two or ten unit long Vector

576
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,000
pointing in the direction, the players going, we multiplied by the DPT

577
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,700
per frame which basically gave us how much to move the guy in position

578
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,000
space for that time.

579
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,500
Step.

580
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,900
That's basically integration.

581
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,700
We integrated a velocity up to a position, right?

582
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,300
That's integration integration goes this direction, right?

583
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
This is a high school calculus again.

584
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,800
Integration goes up derivative goes down.

585
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,900
All right, and so we've already performed an integration.

586
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,400
You just didn't know, we were performing it, and that's not really

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,600
particularly surprising.

588
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,500
Because if you think about what happens here, right?

589
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,700
If you want to integrate a very simple constant quantity, you just

590
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,600
have some motion, that's not at all.

591
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
Dependent on any on time.

592
00:24:59,300 --> 00:24:59,800
Right?

593
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,500
If you just have to integrate two meters per second, right?

594
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,900
Then obviously the integration for that, if you remember your high

595
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,600
school calculus is just multiplying by whatever the change is write,

596
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,500
delta, T is exactly how you would integrate that up to position.

597
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:16,700
Right?

598
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,500
That is a, that is basically a fixed a discrete integration up.

599
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,800
To a position now running out of space here on the board, which is

600
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,800
unfortunate because I'd like to keep going having these things around.

601
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,100
But yeah, no, I can't.

602
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,000
What can I say?

603
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
So let's think about this a little more explicitly, right?

604
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,500
Let's think about position.

605
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,800
And that's my f of T.

606
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,600
I've got velocity.

607
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,300
Which is my f Prime of T, and I've got acceleration.

608
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,300
Which is my f.

609
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,900
Double Prime of T right now what you know you I'm just going to write

610
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
down basically what you probably remember from your high school

611
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,300
Calculus class and then I'll sort of come back to what I was saying.

612
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,700
Just just a few seconds ago and kind of try to tie it up a little bit,

613
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,700
just to make it a little more solid, right?

614
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,800
So if I have some function of position, right?

615
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,100
I don't know what we want to say that it is.

616
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,500
I don't know.

617
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Let's say that we just had some function of position.

618
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,900
So we have our F of T.

619
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,100
That means we're going to plug into T.

620
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,400
We want to get a position out, whatever it is, right, I could say that

621
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,400
that was something like 5T squared, you know, plus 2, t, plus 3,

622
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,600
right?

623
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,400
This is again, standard old calculus stuff that you might see, you

624
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,600
know, in a textbook, right?

625
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,900
And we all remember how you would do the derivatives, right?

626
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
If you want to take the derivative of that function.

627
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,600
You do this thing where you take the exponent of the variable, you

628
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,700
multiply it by the front.

629
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,400
And then you reduce it by one, right?

630
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,800
So you'd end up with 10 T, right?

631
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
Plus again.

632
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
This one doesn't have one.

633
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
So it's just this is just an exponent of 1.

634
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,100
So it's just going to remain to and then reduce it by one that gets to

635
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,300
the 0th, which is nothing.

636
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,900
And then this guy doesn't even have

637
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,600
Variable.

638
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,700
So he ends up getting knocked out entirely.

639
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,200
So he's just gone right?

640
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,300
And so we end up with something like that.

641
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,500
And that is the velocity of this thing right now.

642
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,600
You may ask like, how I don't understand.

643
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
What are we talking about here?

644
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,400
And again, you can think of these just as we were just just think of

645
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,800
these exactly what we're doing here, memory of the X and the Y written

646
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,400
out separately.

647
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,700
Think of these as the Xs and the Y's written out separately.

648
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,100
This is the x-coordinate of our guy.

649
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,300
Let's we just had a function that we said, you know, we just we said

650
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,800
he was on.

651
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Rails.

652
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,900
So as time increases.

653
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,600
He's just at this x coordinate, we just compute it and that's where

654
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,200
he's at.

655
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
And we want to know what the velocity is, right?

656
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,700
So you want to know what the derivative on know how fast he's going?

657
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,800
So this is our velocity.

658
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,500
That's how fast he's going.

659
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,600
That's how fast he's going in X, right?

660
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,300
It's his meter per second.

661
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,100
That's what that is.

662
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
If we want to know is acceleration.

663
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,300
We can take it again, right?

664
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,800
We just go down one more time.

665
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,700
And again, we just this guy drops out.

666
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,200
This guy is removed completely.

667
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,000
So he just left with 10, right?

668
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,700
And that's actually what that's just directly what the acceleration

669
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
actually is right now.

670
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,500
What I hope you can see here, is these relationships are actually very

671
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,000
simple.

672
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:23,000
And if for example, right I wanted to know what I wanted to be able to

673
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,300
do this discreetly, right?

674
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,400
Because what you can, what you can think about here, is this is all

675
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
well and good, but it presupposed that I could write an equation.

676
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,600
That's the location of my guy but I can't write a location.

677
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
That's the equation of my guy.

678
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,400
The the users like entering, you know, commands and stuff.

679
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,000
He's telling me where the guy moves every frame.

680
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,500
It's changing and all this sort of stuff.

681
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,700
So I don't have the luxury of just writing.

682
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,500
Out some specific equation that says, where the guy is for all the

683
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,000
time in my game, for any time Step at the 1st 2nd 3rd 2nd, 5th.

684
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,200
Second, whatever, right?

685
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,400
So what I need to do is I need to move from sort of the way that you

686
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,700
think about it in high school Calculus class, which is perhaps not

687
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,300
very useful.

688
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,200
Even though all the tools are there, right?

689
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,000
I just need to start thinking about this in terms of doing it.

690
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,800
Discreetly.

691
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,700
So that instead of actually trying to make a function.

692
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm just going to say we're going to discretize it down to one time

693
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,800
step, right?

694
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,000
And so if you think about it.

695
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,500
Here's our game time again.

696
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,000
Like we always say I've got x equals.

697
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,100
This is this is frame 0, this is frame 1.

698
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,600
This is frame to this is same three the same for right?

699
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:34,900
And so in time in t this is in frames right in t we basically at time

700
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,300
0 times point zero three three repeating .066 so on right this is what

701
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,400
the T variable is.

702
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,300
If I was lucky enough to have somebody who is always moving based on

703
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,200
just a fixed equation, right?

704
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,500
I really wouldn't have any work to do.

705
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,300
Do all I would do is just take that equation and wherever I was in

706
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,700
time, so I want to draw this Frame.

707
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,500
I just go 0 .066.

708
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,800
I plug it in here and I get the x coordinate out done.

709
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,100
Right, no problems, but we don't have that luxury because the user is

710
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,900
in putting stuff in all this sort of thing.

711
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,900
And so there is no constant equation that we can just use all the time

712
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,200
that will give us back the location of the guy.

713
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,300
So what we need to do instead is switches something where were

714
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,400
essentially discretize inning, these equations of motion and

715
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,700
pretending that the equations of motion are essentially constant over

716
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,600
the time step.

717
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,500
Meaning, we're pretending that the guy is just going to move in a line

718
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,600
over the time step.

719
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,100
And, you know,

720
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,100
Each the times that's going to be so short that he appears to like

721
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,900
curve and do stuff right on when he's actually, when you actually see

722
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,700
him, he appears to be changing direction and doing all these things.

723
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,600
Because over time, you're changing your inputs and all this stuff, but

724
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,100
really in any given time step, what we want to do is discretize it

725
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,300
down so that we're basically just taking the input that you gave and

726
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,400
applying some piecewise function.

727
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,100
The function that only is going to operate over that time step.

728
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
And then, on the next frame, we will essentially be using a different

729
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,100
function.

730
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,600
Which is a different which is response to the Keys differently, right?

731
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,200
And when I say function, I don't really mean much of a function at

732
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,500
all.

733
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
I'm just talking about a very simple function.

734
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,100
That's like like we already had where we have a vector Direction and

735
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,100
we're going to basically pretend that the guy is moving along that

736
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,900
Vector Direction by delta T, right?

737
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,600
Or something like that.

738
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,100
So very, very simple version of the function.

739
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,800
It's nothing nothing complicated.

740
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,300
Nothing too interesting, right?

741
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,500
So in order to discretize this, I guess what I would say is so, you

742
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,300
know, hopefully,

743
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,500
Ali.

744
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,600
People are comfortable with how to take a derivative and what we did

745
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,100
here.

746
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
And basically, what we want to do is say, okay.

747
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,300
Let's just assume right?

748
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,900
That every frame we're going to start down here with a constant

749
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:50,700
acceleration and then we'll just integrate it up right to get our

750
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,100
position to get our velocity in our position.

751
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,400
And we don't care about the fact that, you know, each time.

752
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,100
We integrate it up.

753
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,600
We're essentially creating a holy, a totally different function with

754
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,300
different coefficients.

755
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,500
Right?

756
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,800
Because if this Frame it's 10 and the next frame, that's negative 5,

757
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,000
we're going to completely different values.

758
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
When we do the integration up.

759
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,400
We don't care about that.

760
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,500
Like I said, we're just going to say for each frame.

761
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,700
We're going to pretend that we have a different essentially, a

762
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,500
different set of coefficients as if you will in our function here,

763
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,400
right?

764
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,400
So really, there isn't a whole lot to this.

765
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,500
We already did the work, you can read it right off of here.

766
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,300
Even if you don't know how to integrate, if you just know how to take

767
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,800
derivatives.

768
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
You've already got the answer, like, because we're looking at the

769
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,800
answer right here.

770
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,900
If we wanted to say, we want a particular acceleration on every frame.

771
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,100
Well,

772
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,700
Akira is that acceleration?

773
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Right?

774
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,200
It's tap.

775
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,000
Right, that's the constant acceleration.

776
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,200
So let's just replace that constant acceleration right with whatever

777
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,100
we want the acceleration to be a whatever we compute it to be.

778
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay.

779
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
We then say, all right.

780
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,600
Our velocity is the first integration up from that.

781
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,700
The 10 remember comes from here.

782
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,900
So this is actually

783
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Going to be a and it's a times RT, right?

784
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,100
It's times whatever the whatever, the time value actually is and then

785
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,300
we do plus 2.

786
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
What is that too?

787
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,300
Right?

788
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,800
What does that to actually mean?

789
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, the to is essentially the existing velocity, right?

790
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,100
It's saying this was the part that accounted for the acceleration, the

791
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,900
change in the velocity, right?

792
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,000
Because x t.

793
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,800
So over time, this is change in velocity.

794
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,900
This is the constant velocity.

795
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,900
So this is whatever velocity.

796
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,500
Was on the last frame.

797
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,100
This is what we're coming into it with, right.

798
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
So, this is just RV.

799
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
That's RV turn.

800
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,500
So 80 plus v is actually the term that we want to use for our

801
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,900
velocity.

802
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,300
Right?

803
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,800
And then finally, we get up here, you can see that we get integrated

804
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,700
up one more time.

805
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,600
This plus right here is just the existing position of the guy, right?

806
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,900
This, we're adding a new position for the guy.

807
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,700
We're taking his old position in updating it.

808
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,700
So this, this constant, that was in here before is just wherever he

809
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,800
was right there.

810
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,400
P.

811
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,000
Right, this guy right here.

812
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,300
Is the velocity.

813
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,400
Again, write that too.

814
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
That was the to, from right here, right?

815
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,500
So that's just the V.

816
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,600
And then here you can actually see any of, this is why I say, even if

817
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,900
you don't remember how you how to do integration.

818
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,400
You can Cheat It by just doing the derivitive and then doing it

819
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,000
backwards.

820
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Remember how we got this?

821
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,800
We did 2 times 5, right?

822
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Equals the 10.

823
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,699
So all we have to do is divide the a by to to do our final

824
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,600
integration, right?

825
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,800
That's why this was five instead of 10, right?

826
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,600
So instead we just have a

827
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,300
R22 + V + P, right.

828
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,100
So what does that actually give us that actually gives us the final if

829
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,400
I just read these off and get rid of the scribbles, right?

830
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,000
That basically gives us that our top equation for motion is, you know,

831
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,100
one half a times t squared, which is this term right here, right?

832
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,700
Plus v times t plus the old position, right?

833
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
So, whatever the old position was.

834
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,200
Yeah.

835
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,700
And again, this V is actually the old

836
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
Velocity as well.

837
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,000
The velocity right whatever.

838
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,600
And so this is our new position.

839
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,700
This is our and a lot of times we do p Prime for that.

840
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,800
So you don't to keep writing old.

841
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
You just assume that these were the old ones P Prime is the new

842
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,400
position.

843
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
So we just have P.

844
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,300
Prime equals one half.

845
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,100
Ay, t squared plus v t plus P, right?

846
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,100
And so if I want to note p double prime or basically the the, you

847
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,100
know, the new velocity right V Prime, then that's just this equation.

848
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
That's a t plus v and then

849
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,900
Finally, if I want to know the the acceleration.

850
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
It's just prescribed.

851
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,100
So basically, there is no new acceleration because we never saved

852
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,800
acceleration.

853
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,900
So there's just acceleration that we specify and now we can specify

854
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,400
whatever acceleration we want and we can compute any of the quantities

855
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,500
that we actually wanted to compute.

856
00:35:59,300 --> 00:35:59,800
Now.

857
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,700
You will notice that these things basically don't even really imp.

858
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,000
These don't really imply all that much more stuff than what we were

859
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
already doing.

860
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,300
Right?

861
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Essentially.

862
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We just didn't have these terms.

863
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,700
Okay, we had this.

864
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,100
That's all we had, right?

865
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,000
If that makes sense.

866
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I haven't really talked about the delta T part, but just bear with me

867
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,200
for a second.

868
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,300
There's a lot of stuff to cover here.

869
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
So I'm trying to make it.

870
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,000
Let's see how much we got.

871
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,200
Whoo, we're tight on time.

872
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
Alright, so

873
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
If you take a look here, we already had exactly that top equation.

874
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,800
Minus the acceleration, right?

875
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,200
We just didn't have an acceleration in there.

876
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,800
We had whatever the DT was times, the velocity that we wanted the guy

877
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,100
to go at, right?

878
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,300
And so, that was this, that's the velocity times the time, plus the

879
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,600
old position velocity times, the time plus, the old position, right?

880
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,900
So we were already Computing.

881
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,400
Part of this equation and your intuition, when you're writing a game

882
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,700
code Eve.

883
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,600
If you didn't know any of this stuff is to write that, right.

884
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,800
That's what you would write and that's what we did, right.

885
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
So really, the only thing we have to start doing now is thinking about

886
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,400
this other part.

887
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,200
That's maybe not so intuitive, which is that there's another quantity

888
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,700
here, which gets accumulated into that velocity.

889
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,000
So, the velocity is now something that's actually needs to be stored

890
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,000
from frame to frame, so that we know how fast something was going so

891
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
that we can update it with our acceleration, every frame, and then

892
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,200
integrate it into what we think, the position should be and so on.

893
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,500
And similarly,

894
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,600
In order to properly account for the effect that the acceleration has,

895
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
we want to put it in this equation as well.

896
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,800
We want to put in this part of the equation here, the one half, ay T

897
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,500
Square to account for the effect that the acceleration has over this

898
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
time step as well.

899
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,300
Right?

900
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,200
Because without this essentially, what would happen is we would be

901
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,300
assuming that that acceleration was not actually continuously

902
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,300
happening over the course of the frame.

903
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,500
Now we could argue which one of those we'd rather have whether we want

904
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,000
to have an instantaneous acceleration.

905
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,400
In which is what would happen if we didn't do it this way, right?

906
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,800
Let me let me, let me explain this a little more detail.

907
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,700
There's two ways we could have chosen to program.

908
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,900
This one is to do this step first, right?

909
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And use V Prime here.

910
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,000
Okay.

911
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,200
Do you see what that would do?

912
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:19,000
That would still get us a t squared for our evaluation because

913
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,200
basically, this 80 is baked into here.

914
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
Write this term, right?

915
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,500
Which was normally V T, which is the old velocity times time, which

916
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,300
just says that velocity is carrying through from, whatever it

917
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,500
previously was carrying to this Frame, right?

918
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,700
If I change that to be V Prime T.

919
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,500
Well V Prime.

920
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:35,800
T.

921
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,100
Is this, right?

922
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,800
So if I multiply that out, I'd get a t squared plus v t which is close

923
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,400
to this but not quite because there's that one half in there.

924
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,800
So, essentially what happens is that 1/2 is counting for the fact that

925
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,400
the acceleration is being evenly distributed across the time.

926
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,300
Step not instantaneously applied at the beginning of the frame and so

927
00:38:59,300 --> 00:38:59,500
it is

928
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,200
More accurate to do it that way, in terms of what you were trying to

929
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:03,900
actually simulate.

930
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,300
But we have to also acknowledge here for anyone who wants to write it.

931
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,300
The more simplistic way of just doing this and then using the Prime in

932
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,700
here is that we're gonna hack all these variables.

933
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,900
Anyway, we're going to tune all these variables to be stuff that feels

934
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,700
good to play and so at the end of the day, it's hard to get too

935
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,200
pedantic about it and go.

936
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Well you got to do your one half.

937
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,900
Ay T square.

938
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,800
And if you don't do one half your you're not doing it right or

939
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,200
whatever.

940
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,800
It's hard to, you know, to really make that argument, right?

941
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,900
But what I will say, is, if you want to do real physics at some point,

942
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,200
you need to start thinking sweating, those kind of details, because

943
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
things start to get much more important when you're not hacking a

944
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,200
bunch of variables to just make the guy feel good or whatever and you

945
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,100
want to actually try and get realistic believable, behaviors out of

946
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,000
certain physical properties and that's our stuff.

947
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,500
So it's good to know what the equations are and how they work before

948
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,700
you start short-circuiting them.

949
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,600
So that you don't end up at a limit where you can't get past something

950
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,800
and you can't make something.

951
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Feel our work, right?

952
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,800
Because you forgotten all the stuff in been sloppy, right?

953
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,900
So it's good to know.

954
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,900
It's good to know the rules and then break them.

955
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,800
Not just sort of go willy-nilly about it.

956
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
So I just want to kind of point that out.

957
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,200
Okay, so finally really quickly and maybe we'll have to go over this

958
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,900
again tomorrow.

959
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Because there's been there's a lot.

960
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
I had to talk a lot to sort of talk some of these things out and I

961
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,000
feel like a lot of its just very detailed and tough perhaps to absorb.

962
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,600
But anyway, what I did want to say is where does delta T come in,

963
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,200
right?

964
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,800
Because those

965
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,200
Functions that I wrote over there, they were continuous functions.

966
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:39,500
So when I said one half, ay, t squared, right, plus v t plus P Prime

967
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,500
when I said that, that's just a function that where you plug in a tea,

968
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,300
right?

969
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,900
That's a function where I just plug in some T value and I get the

970
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,900
position straight out, right?

971
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,300
So what's going on here?

972
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,900
And the answer is well.

973
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,100
Remember what I said we were going to do is treat these functions as

974
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,800
if they only exist for

975
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
Time step, right?

976
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,400
So effectively what we're doing is every frame we're creating a new

977
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,400
equation of motion where we specify a new acceleration, integrate it

978
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,700
up twice to get our equation of motion that will store, you know, our

979
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
new, our new

980
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,900
velocity and our new position, right?

981
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,400
And so really, this is f of 0 at the beginning of a frame and F of

982
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,300
delta T, you know, however, much the frame time is is here.

983
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,100
Then on the next frame, we're going to do the exact same thing.

984
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:32,800
Again percent.

985
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,600
This is f of 0 and pretend this is f of delta T.

986
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,000
And what do we want to know?

987
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,800
We want to know where the guy would be at the end of the frame, right?

988
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,600
So if we want to know where the guy would be at the end of the frame.

989
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
Well, that's delta T.

990
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,900
That's what we would plug in.

991
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,100
So

992
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,000
We plug in delta T to R function, delta T, delta T and that's why

993
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,800
everything is in terms of delta T.

994
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,900
It's because really delta T is the time at which we want to know if he

995
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,800
wanted to know where the guy was at the beginning of the

996
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,300
Name.

997
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,000
We could still use the same equation.

998
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:07,100
It's just all of these terms drop out and we just get P Prime, right t

999
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,900
squared, if delta T if we're plugging in 0 for this, we're saying F of

1000
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,300
0 that drops out because obviously 1/2 a zero is zero.

1001
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,200
Same thing with v t if T is 0, the V drops out and we're just left

1002
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,900
with P 1.

1003
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,800
Which is exactly what we would expect.

1004
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,300
If we haven't gone any further.

1005
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,800
If we haven't got anywhere in time.

1006
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,200
We would expect the guy to be wherever he was at the end of the last

1007
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,300
frame, which is p Prime, right?

1008
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:29,800
So,

1009
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,900
Again, what we're trying to do here is we're just trying to put

1010
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:35,200
together piecewise functions that get us from one frame to the next

1011
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,500
and we restart the function at the beginning of every frame, right?

1012
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,900
So it goes from zero to Delta t 0 to Delta, t 0 to delta, T right now,

1013
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,500
that's not to say that we couldn't have some, some object that does

1014
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,700
have a function that uses across many frames.

1015
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,000
That's totally something we could do if you want to do.

1016
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,200
It's just that's not something that's particularly useful for a guy

1017
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,600
who's under player control.

1018
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Because when you're under player,

1019
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,600
You really do restart your your acceleration, every frame in.

1020
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,000
You're getting basically a totally different function.

1021
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,600
It's not some smooth continuous function that can be mathematically

1022
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,500
analyze in that way.

1023
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
It's piecewise what it's called, right?

1024
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,600
It's a piecewise function, which means, you know, a normal smooth,

1025
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,500
continuous function.

1026
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,700
Looks like this kind of thing.

1027
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,400
A piecewise function is one that's got gas, you know, that kind of

1028
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,100
thing, right?

1029
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,000
And it doesn't actually have to be lines in between there.

1030
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It could be straight, you know, like this it could have curves but

1031
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
then the curves, have sharp Bend points, right?

1032
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:29,700
And those peace.

1033
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,900
That's why they called piecewise.

1034
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,500
Because there's basically it's pieces, right?

1035
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,700
Little individual segments.

1036
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And basically, that's what we're doing with our stuff now.

1037
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Okay, so very quickly, we don't have very much time left, obviously,

1038
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,200
because I had to sort of Yammer on it.

1039
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,100
You about those things.

1040
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,800
What what did I actually need their?

1041
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,500
Well, remember I need a velocity.

1042
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,800
I need to store a velocity, right?

1043
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,600
I need to store and I usually use D like that's what I use.

1044
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
Dd2.

1045
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
No accelerations.

1046
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,300
I use D to denote.

1047
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,900
Well, I used EDD second derivative D for first derivative, right?

1048
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,600
So, one of the things I need to do now is we were just working with

1049
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,200
the velocity.

1050
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,300
That was just a only existed on that frame.

1051
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,800
We need to start storing that velocity because remember, V, the old V

1052
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,900
came into play there.

1053
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,800
The old velocity.

1054
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,300
So we need to start storing that from frame to frame, and we can

1055
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,400
assume it starts at 0, that's totally fine.

1056
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,700
Because obviously we know that the guy will not be moving at startup.

1057
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,800
He's just staying where he is.

1058
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,500
And so then what I need to do in here is I need to start thinking

1059
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,900
about this in terms of his acceleration.

1060
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,100
Not his his

1061
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,400
Velocity change.

1062
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,900
So what I'm going to do instead here is say that this deep layer,

1063
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,700
right?

1064
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,700
That we're actually doing here is actually DD, right?

1065
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,900
So deep layer is going to become the DVD player.

1066
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,000
So that's actually his second derivative of his position.

1067
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,800
Right?

1068
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,100
And so now, what I'm going to do, I obviously still want to compute.

1069
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,500
I want to compute those equations of motion the way that I said I

1070
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,800
wanted to the thing.

1071
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,900
So again, we have

1072
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,400
Write them out for you again.

1073
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,700
So, again, we have 1/2 80 Square D.

1074
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,100
Right?

1075
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,200
Plus VT plus old prop P.

1076
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:09,600
Right?

1077
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,900
That's our equation for.

1078
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,400
I'm sorry.

1079
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,000
There we go.

1080
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,900
That's our new position.

1081
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,400
Right?

1082
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,400
And we have for our second derivative, right or our velocity.

1083
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,800
Our new velocity is.

1084
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,500
We said that that was just going to be 80, plus the old velocity and

1085
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,800
similarly, the acceleration right is just specified.

1086
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,100
We don't have to do anything about that.

1087
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,100
We're just specifying it that the user is basically, this is this is

1088
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,600
coming.

1089
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,100
This is coming from the d-pad, right?

1090
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,200
The user is saying what that acceleration is.

1091
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,600
Okay, so we want to actually just compute that not too hard 1/2, write

1092
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,600
a times t squared.

1093
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,700
So I'll go ahead and say Square.

1094
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,500
We need to write that we have written that yet.

1095
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,400
So that's real.

1096
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,700
Literally one half.

1097
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Ay, T Square dry time.

1098
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,400
Really, just literally typing it in, then I want to do the same thing.

1099
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,500
Or the the VT right?

1100
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,400
The v t term.

1101
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,200
So that's a curious, his velocity.

1102
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,100
His velocity is the game State deep layer.

1103
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,300
There we go, times that times that Delta.

1104
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,100
There's tea.

1105
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,900
And then I just need to use his old position which for, you know, just

1106
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,200
to make it totally clear.

1107
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,100
I'll put it in there and change this to it equals.

1108
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,700
So that way it looks exactly like the equation.

1109
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,200
We wrote one half.

1110
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,400
Ay, t squared times, VI plus v t plus the old position, right?

1111
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,700
So that's the update right there.

1112
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,300
Very simple.

1113
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,000
And the other thing I can then do is say I'm going to change his

1114
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
velocity as well and so his velocity and there's a couple things we

1115
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,200
want to actually talk about here.

1116
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,200
So the velocity update is going to get a little fancy.

1117
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,400
In this potentially because of when the player is Click colliding with

1118
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,700
things.

1119
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,300
But for right now, let's ignore that.

1120
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
So that we can because we don't have a lot of time like I said, so

1121
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,600
we'll kind of do a more straightforward version.

1122
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,100
So to update that velocity to give him his new velocity again, it's

1123
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,600
really simple.

1124
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,200
It's just the 80 plus v.

1125
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,700
And so I literally type that in, there's my a right.

1126
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,300
There's my tea, right?

1127
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,900
And and then I need my old, my old beat.

1128
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,900
Which is this right there.

1129
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,200
Okay, and so that's pretty straightforward.

1130
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:16,700
Forward.

1131
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,500
There really isn't all that much to it.

1132
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,500
That is the entirety of the actual code that we would need to do to do

1133
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,200
the update.

1134
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,300
So all we really need to do now is actually create that that D&D

1135
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,000
player correctly and so we could probably just leave it as it is right

1136
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,500
now which is to say that he accelerates at 10 meters per second

1137
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,800
squared now, right?

1138
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,800
Because again, this is an acceleration.

1139
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,800
So it is now no longer meters per second.

1140
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,200
It's meters per second squared.

1141
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,500
That is just sort of taking the derivative in time space, right?

1142
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,900
Because remember T.

1143
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,200
We are not taking, it's important to remember.

1144
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,700
We're not taking a spatial derivative.

1145
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,400
We're taking a derivative respect to time.

1146
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,500
And so basically, we start off in M.

1147
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,800
We get meters per second and then we end up with me.

1148
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
S squared all the way at the bottom time is the thing that's

1149
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,900
increasing in order of magnitude in in in power here as we take that

1150
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,600
derivative.

1151
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,800
We are never actually changing the meters because we're not taking a

1152
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,200
spatial derivative.

1153
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,800
We're not trying to ask how these equations change.

1154
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,200
When we move around.

1155
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,600
We're trying to ask how we move around based on changes in time.

1156
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,200
And so, that is why you notice the M doesn't change, that's kind of a

1157
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,300
topic for another day, but point being started to it anyway.

1158
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,300
So we got our acceleration now.

1159
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,800
And in theory, I think, actually, I, that was literally all the code

1160
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,100
that we would need to write to give our guy momentum, but we need to

1161
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,200
write that square function.

1162
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,400
So in my handmade math, I'm going to go in here as well.

1163
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,900
And add a little squaring function, a squaring function is just one

1164
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,100
that takes its value and returns it squared.

1165
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,200
But simplest possible thing you could imagine write a times a and

1166
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,800
there we go.

1167
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,500
So that's just a way and it there.

1168
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,200
Why do you do that?

1169
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,500
Why not just write eight times a well.

1170
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,400
It's a little bit easier.

1171
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,700
This might be a whole expression sometime, right.

1172
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,800
Like,

1173
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:01,400
Right?

1174
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,000
Or something like that.

1175
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
And you don't want to have to type that out twice because you might

1176
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,000
make mistakes.

1177
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,600
So it's nice to have a little squaring function that you can just use

1178
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,400
to save on the type Hoops.

1179
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,400
That's deep layer p.

1180
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,200
And there we go.

1181
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,600
So, I believe our guy, we probably have to slow of acceleration.

1182
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,000
Now, I don't know if we do or not.

1183
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,100
Now, there we go.

1184
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,300
So basically our guy now has momentum and he behaves exactly.

1185
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,000
As you expect, kind of like, for lack of a better term, like a hockey

1186
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,800
skater, right?

1187
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,800
Because remember, we've

1188
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,900
Done no friction on this guy.

1189
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,900
So now, he is essentially, you know, he's an asteroids guy.

1190
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,100
He's floating in space.

1191
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,700
He has no particular friction, but as you can see, you can see how

1192
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,500
trivial that was.

1193
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,100
And now he behaves exactly.

1194
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,100
As you would expect a physical object with no friction to behave.

1195
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,000
Just because we spent the, you know, what is it?

1196
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,700
Five seconds.

1197
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,400
I mean, I had to explain it to you for 45 minutes, but once you

1198
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,700
actually know what it is, you saw how trivial that was to type in.

1199
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,600
Right now.

1200
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,200
We've got the correct equations of motions for the guy and it already

1201
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,700
feels kind of fun to drive them around.

1202
00:49:59,700 --> 00:49:59,800
This is

1203
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,800
Of ridiculous.

1204
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,100
And so now you can actually see already.

1205
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,700
The thing I was talking about, when I said the, we have some decisions

1206
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,500
and some interesting stuff.

1207
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,400
We have think about in terms of his velocity when he comes in here and

1208
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,100
he sticks on that wall, right?

1209
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,200
Our Collision detector isn't letting him go through the wall, which is

1210
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,400
good, but we're not changing his velocity to be zero.

1211
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,800
We're just storing his velocity.

1212
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,400
As if it's still fully accelerated in that fully going that direction,

1213
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,600
which means if I push the back Direction, I have to push for a while

1214
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:29,800
to accept.

1215
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,600
Seller ate him up, right?

1216
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,700
And we could actually if we wanted to, we could probably do something

1217
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,600
where we actually showed what his velocity was.

1218
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,600
Maybe that'd be a good idea to do in the sort of quickly at the end of

1219
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,100
the stream here.

1220
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,000
And so what we probably want to do right because that doesn't feel

1221
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,300
very good for the player to get stuck into the well what we probably

1222
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,900
want to do very soon and I don't know if it's going to be tonight

1223
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,000
because we're mostly out of time, but we want to start thinking about

1224
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,700
things like obviously, when we do the friction and stuff.

1225
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,800
We also want to think about things too, like updating velocity so that

1226
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,800
the velocity is actually what his velocity.

1227
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
Turns out to be after Collision detection, is done stopping him when

1228
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,700
he runs into walls and stuff because that seems like a much senior

1229
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,100
thing for the player to deal with instead of having this hidden

1230
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,100
pretend velocity that, it doesn't really represent the velocity of the

1231
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,500
spread on the screen, right?

1232
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:15,800
So that's it.

1233
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,100
That's really all there is to that.

1234
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,900
So now if we wanted to write, we could do something where we

1235
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,100
introduced some kind of friction as well to the dude, right?

1236
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:27,500
And

1237
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,600
if we wanted to write, we could say, as he's running around, he gets

1238
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,300
some kind of a friction that's based on his velocity.

1239
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:38,600
Right?

1240
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,800
And I remember we mentioned drag as well, was another thing based on

1241
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,100
based on the velocity.

1242
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,800
And so I don't want to try to get into ordinary ordinary, differential

1243
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,300
equations.

1244
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,000
Obviously at this point, especially not with only like 10 minutes left

1245
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,300
in the Stream, but if we wanted to right now, we could totally make

1246
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,400
it.

1247
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
So the this guy actually had some friction by doing a sort of like

1248
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,200
approximated friction.

1249
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,100
That doesn't actually quite do exactly the right thing.

1250
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,500
So I'm going to go ahead and set our Loop Live code editing up here.

1251
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,100
I'm going to have him kind of go this way and then come this way.

1252
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,600
And then come this way again.

1253
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,500
Like so and then have that go right.

1254
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,700
So I'm going to let that guy run there.

1255
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,200
While we make our modifications.

1256
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,100
I'm going to go ahead and set him up over here.

1257
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,300
And then I'm going to open the window.

1258
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,400
I'm going to go ahead and do something.

1259
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,500
I haven't done before, which is delete this window, and then actually

1260
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,600
kind of come over here and do that.

1261
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,200
All right.

1262
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,500
So, here we go.

1263
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,700
So now what we should be able to do right is we should we can see

1264
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:35,900
that?

1265
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,000
He's really swimming, like you can see how swimming it is for me when

1266
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,200
I was controlling any kind of swims back and forth.

1267
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,900
And so I want to go ahead and add some kind of a function in here.

1268
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,900
That's going to reduce his speed based on how fast he's going.

1269
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,400
So, the faster he goes, the more it will push back against him.

1270
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,900
So like a friction force or a drag force that sort of thing.

1271
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,900
And so again, I can't quite do this, exactly correctly because we're

1272
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,100
going to need, are there for ordinary.

1273
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,400
Differential equations, if we actually want to make something behave

1274
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,700
properly, but for now, we can hack something in and so I will say, oh,

1275
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,300
and you know, what?

1276
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,100
We did fix the diagonal will be faster problem.

1277
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,300
We just didn't quite do it.

1278
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,000
The way that we said, we're going to do a little bit of that

1279
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,500
eventually.

1280
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:20,200
Anyway, so to do OD e here and so maybe we'll talk about that soon.

1281
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,100
But anyway, so what I want to do here is I want to say, okay.

1282
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:23,700
Let's apply that.

1283
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,200
Friction Force.

1284
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:24,300
Now.

1285
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,400
I know how fast he was going.

1286
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,800
On the last frame.

1287
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Obviously, and I also know how fast he's going on this Frame.

1288
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,600
And so the question is I guess which exactly one do I want to use?

1289
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,100
And this is where if you were using OD e it would be correct, but

1290
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,300
we're not actually going to do that.

1291
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,800
We're going to do the hacky version.

1292
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,000
So I guess I'm going to use the old one the one from last frame.

1293
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,100
So I want to say is kids, velocity.

1294
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,200
I'm going to basically say his acceleration.

1295
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,500
You know, I shouldn't do this.

1296
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:48,700
Here.

1297
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,300
I can just put it.

1298
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,500
I'll just pack that acceleration.

1299
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,900
I'm going to say that there's another force acting on him.

1300
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,200
So basically his DVD player, right, kids acceleration.

1301
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,700
I'm going to go ahead and say I want to add into that acceleration.

1302
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Here, I want to add in a force that's going to counteract his

1303
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,700
velocity.

1304
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,300
So basically, I'll take whatever his velocity is, and I'm going to,

1305
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:11,300
you know, say that he's going to accelerate in the opposite direction

1306
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,600
of whatever that velocity is.

1307
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,600
And for right now, let's even say that it's the full magnitude of

1308
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
whatever the velocity is.

1309
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,900
So you remember, this is our acceleration.

1310
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,700
So I'm just adding in an acceleration that's in the opposite direction

1311
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:23,700
of the direction.

1312
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,300
He's moving, right?

1313
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,000
And so I'm going to save that will go ahead and compile that.

1314
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,900
I don't know why it decided to open that window.

1315
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,700
Do, that's probably the least useful thing.

1316
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,700
It could have done.

1317
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,500
There we go.

1318
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,700
So that looks a little too strong right.

1319
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,400
As you can kind of see when you're looking at how he's going.

1320
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,700
It just looks a little bit too strong.

1321
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,100
So maybe I'll chop that down a little bit.

1322
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,400
Let's say point five, right?

1323
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,800
That looks a little bit better and kind of see.

1324
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,900
Right?

1325
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,700
You can you can do is turn pretty good now, right?

1326
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,900
So that seems like a pretty reasonable coefficient to use their, I

1327
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,100
don't know.

1328
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,200
Let me jump back in and actually drive them around.

1329
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,600
Yeah.

1330
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,400
Yeah, that feels pretty good.

1331
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,000
Yeah, that's not bad.

1332
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,300
Now.

1333
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,200
I feel like I feel like he's still a little sluggish though.

1334
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,100
So I kind of feel like I want him to be a little bit.

1335
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,900
You know, I think maybe this this acceleration is a little too slow.

1336
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,800
So I'm going to jack that acceleration up a bit and then maybe I can

1337
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,200
make this guy a little bit higher.

1338
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,500
Let's find out.

1339
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,000
Oops.

1340
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,900
So, you can kind of see that street even starts to look better, right?

1341
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,100
As you're doing that and now I can make this dude, a little bit

1342
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,300
stiffer as well.

1343
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:55,600
Right?

1344
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,400
He can sort of be a little bit higher because now I've got more

1345
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,800
acceleration to counteract it, right?

1346
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,800
Yeah, so feeling a little bit better.

1347
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,700
It's still a little bit at again, the higher I crank, these two

1348
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,600
values, the the stiffer that.

1349
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,800
So the more that there's a counteracting force in the more that the

1350
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,500
acceleration pushes against it, the stiffer that return to 0 is

1351
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,900
essentially, if that makes sense.

1352
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,500
So, if I crank this up pretty, pretty darn high, right?

1353
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,300
And then did that, maybe?

1354
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,800
I don't know.

1355
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm just, I'm just again just totally playing around with this.

1356
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,900
Just to see.

1357
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,000
You can see that he gets a nice fast.

1358
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,600
Stop there.

1359
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:32,800
Right?

1360
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,400
I think I'm gonna give them.

1361
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,300
Even a little bit faster than that.

1362
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,300
So let's go ahead and Jack that 22, right?

1363
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:41,000
This is why I said we're just going to, we're totally going to just

1364
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,700
write whatever random numbers.

1365
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,500
We want in here as we tune it.

1366
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,200
So you can kind of, you can kind of see, he's already starting to feel

1367
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,800
a little bit better in terms of that, that sort of stopping Behavior

1368
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,300
or I'm gonna give him, maybe, maybe 1.5 the jackpot for tonight.

1369
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,500
Again, we don't really want to spend too much time on this because

1370
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,600
we're going to change much stuff.

1371
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,900
So now he feels pretty nice like I could see, I could see playing a

1372
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,700
game with that behavior.

1373
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,500
Right?

1374
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,900
I could see that being I could see that being just enough swimming has

1375
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,000
to feel good, but not too much.

1376
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,000
It might be still a little bit.

1377
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,100
You know, there's a lot of things I'm going to want to do to this

1378
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,600
eventually.

1379
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,300
Let's put it that way.

1380
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,900
But you know, for now that's certainly fine.

1381
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,100
And of course, now I can sort of get him as it goes through here.

1382
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:27,500
Now, what?

1383
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,500
The other thing is, I can also still keep my

1384
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,700
Ation key I suppose I can make it so that, you know, he gets a nice

1385
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,800
big speed boost.

1386
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,900
We and of course, since we did all that through the acceleration that

1387
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,800
even keeps his momentum and everything, which is kind of nice, right?

1388
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,000
Yeah, so it's all good.

1389
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,700
We still have we still haven't fixed the Collision detection.

1390
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,600
The question is action.

1391
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,200
Still a mess.

1392
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
So that's no good.

1393
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,000
But wait, is our Y?

1394
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,900
Is our oh, there we go.

1395
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,200
That's like, are we not?

1396
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,600
I thought maybe I broke something as he wasn't walking off the screen

1397
00:57:59,600 --> 00:57:59,700
there.

1398
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,800
But all right.

1399
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,300
There we go.

1400
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,500
Yeah, so that's pretty good.

1401
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,200
All right.

1402
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,600
So I think that's good enough for today.

1403
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,100
Obviously, we've got a lot of stuff that we'd want to do to make that

1404
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,100
to make this more interesting.

1405
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,400
And so I think maybe but, you know, that's the basics of the equations

1406
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,800
of motion and I think they are relatively straightforward when you

1407
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,100
start playing with them certainly and you know, will keep will

1408
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,000
continue to talk about them more as we go.

1409
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,600
Now one thing.

1410
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:33,300
I did want to mention just really quickly that sort of kind of came up

1411
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,700
with the end there and I just don't feel like I really set it up

1412
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,300
enough for you to make.

1413
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,000
Interesting.

1414
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,300
Here is again.

1415
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,500
Why vectors are so darn nice and why I said I wanted to get a little

1416
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,700
simple Vector struct in there for us to work with before.

1417
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,400
We actually did any real player movement code or anything.

1418
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,100
You notice how easy it was for me to slam this, correction in here,

1419
00:58:59,200 --> 00:58:59,400
right?

1420
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,000
To just say, I want something that's going to be a friction force that

1421
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,900
acts against the players motion Direction.

1422
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,200
Well, before we only had, you know, when this was all doing x's and

1423
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,000
y's explicitly, it would have been

1424
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,200
Harder much harder for me to start thinking about.

1425
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,700
OK, there's two different directions that are happening.

1426
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,900
What is the direction of motion?

1427
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,400
The other one is the direction.

1428
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,100
That's the of the opposite of the direction of the Velocity, like, all

1429
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:21,500
of that.

1430
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Just totally.

1431
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,400
I didn't have to think about because I can just go, this is an

1432
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,200
acceleration that has a direction.

1433
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,400
It's a vector, it knows directions already.

1434
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,600
So I can go ahead and just add more vectors in here and it will

1435
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,600
automatically figure out what the new composite direction is given the

1436
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,900
fact that was adding two different Corrections.

1437
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,400
In for the acceleration one, that's about what the users pushing in

1438
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,100
one that's about the friction and it kind of just allows you to sort

1439
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,400
of smush.

1440
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,700
All this stuff together vectors allow you to keep like adding that

1441
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,400
stuff in there.

1442
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,300
And so again, it's really nice because I can basically say, okay.

1443
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,300
I've got my acceleration for the player.

1444
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,800
I started out having the direction that the person was was

1445
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,400
Thing.

1446
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,600
But then I added the sort of the, the force that was counteracting

1447
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,900
some velocity already had.

1448
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,200
And that gave me a new vector.

1449
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,700
And then I did some other stuff like what the Collision which was

1450
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,200
trimmed it down to hear whatever.

1451
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:14,600
And the vectors just store all that and track all that really nicely

1452
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,800
and the fundamental operations on them look intuitive.

1453
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,700
Like, hey, look, I'm adding the negative of his velocity which acts

1454
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,000
against his velocity, right?

1455
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,600
It does exactly what you would think it would do.

1456
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,800
And so Vector is just really help you here.

1457
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
Because if we did all this in scalar,

1458
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,100
It would just get so intractable so fast and we'd have x's and y's all

1459
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,500
over the place and we were like, yeah, right.

1460
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,400
And so that's what's really nice about that.

1461
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,000
So I will stop talking about that now, and I will go to the Q&A.

1462
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,300
So, starting now, please type in any questions that you have with q:

1463
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,400
and then the question, so I can see it.

1464
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,200
And please keep whatever.

1465
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,300
You ask to stuff that we did on today's three more previous streams.

1466
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:58,400
If you want to ask it off, topic question, there is plenty of time for

1467
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,800
that, but we do it in the priest.

1468
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,200
So we do it come about 15 minutes early from the scheduled starting

1469
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,100
time and I answer whatever random questions you want at that time.

1470
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,900
So if you do have random questions at off-topic stuff, I will answer

1471
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:09,100
them.

1472
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,300
I just want to answer them in the Q&A here.

1473
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:24,800
Let's see.

1474
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,600
So why use real physics instead of something more custom that can be

1475
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,500
hand-tuned.

1476
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,100
So well, we are using something custom that's hand-tuned.

1477
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:32,800
Right?

1478
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,100
I mean you just saw me hand-tuned it right?

1479
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,800
We're not.

1480
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,300
We didn't try to go measure anything in particular, right?

1481
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:43,200
We didn't we didn't try to make this accurately simulate the motion of

1482
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,100
a human or anything.

1483
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,100
So the reason that we started with the physics equations is because

1484
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,100
well and you know what?

1485
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,300
This is actually pretty important point.

1486
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,900
So let me really say this rather forcefully, actually I try and I try

1487
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,500
to keep game design opinions, roughly out of the stream as much as

1488
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:01,900
possible.

1489
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,900
But I feel like this one kind of transcends game design, and there's

1490
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,800
more about just good programming and good game development.

1491
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,100
And that is so many games that I see.

1492
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,200
That are especially indie games because they maybe are programmers,

1493
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,900
who don't have as much experience with physics or whatever they feel

1494
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:26,600
awful to control and they had, you know, it was something custom that.

1495
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,300
They just typed in and that they just, you know, tuned for whatever

1496
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:34,100
that definition is, but because they don't have perhaps the background

1497
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,000
or know the the fundamentals of how physical objects work.

1498
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:44,000
They're never really able to get things feeling that visceral physical

1499
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
feel that you only get from starting with real equations of motion and

1500
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,700
then tuning them into the position that you actually want them.

1501
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,000
Which is to not to say that they're going to be accurate, but having

1502
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,800
the full power of real physics behind you knowing what those equations

1503
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,700
are and only violating them when you think.

1504
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,300
Should yields a game that just feels so much more natural to a

1505
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:05,500
person's brain?

1506
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:09,100
Because all the stuff they expect to see happen to objects.

1507
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,100
Does happen to objects.

1508
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,100
Like if someone's trying to do a jump and it doesn't happen in a

1509
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,700
parabola style shape.

1510
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:20,300
It's a lot harder for them to intuitively understand how to make those

1511
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,300
jumps, right?

1512
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,800
And so a lot of times like you'll you want to start with that basic

1513
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,700
concept so that the player has a leg up on understanding and using it

1514
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:29,900
and

1515
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,800
Then when you want to add air control and you want to add, you know,

1516
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,900
whatever the double jump thrust or whatever, that's all great.

1517
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,900
And you should do it but you should start with the basics.

1518
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,300
So that people's built in understanding of how to predict the motion

1519
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,300
of objects, which has been hardwired into their brain.

1520
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,100
From birth.

1521
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,700
Is it always having to do other stuff too?

1522
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,500
To sort of compensate for the fact that you weren't giving them the

1523
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,200
Baseline that they probably should have for playing the game.

1524
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,000
And in our game already.

1525
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,800
We have one of those which drives me insane, and that's the wall

1526
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,000
stickiness thing, right?

1527
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,200
When I see that happen.

1528
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
It just feels awful.

1529
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,300
And so, that's like the very next thing on my hit list, right?

1530
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
When I think about what I would want to do here, and again, it may not

1531
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,700
actually be the next thing on our hit list.

1532
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,400
Because I tried to structure things in our in like educational order,

1533
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,400
not in when I absolutely think I would go do them because they drive

1534
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,300
me nuts order.

1535
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,100
Or whatever that drives me nuts.

1536
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:25,200
And so what I want to see happen there as I want to see a little

1537
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:30,500
bounce, perhaps I want to see a nice smooth Glide along that, you

1538
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,300
know, I want to have a real nice feel for when I hit an edge.

1539
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,000
Right?

1540
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,200
And so that already is not happening the way a physical physical.

1541
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,100
Just don't stop.

1542
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:42,000
When they hit a wall, they maintain momentum in the directions where

1543
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,500
the wall wasn't, right.

1544
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,900
They have that effect.

1545
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,300
And so I want to see I want to see that happen to the object because

1546
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,500
it feels so much better to have that actually happen.

1547
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,300
And so yes, so I highly highly highly recommend that no matter what

1548
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,900
your end goal is start with the closest real physical equations that

1549
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,700
you can find to what you're trying to do and then back off them as

1550
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,100
necessary to get the effect you want.

1551
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,500
Don't go the other way around which is tried to start just typing

1552
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,100
stuff in and hoping that you end up with something good because I see

1553
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:13,100
that fail.

1554
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,400
So often that I think there's a real risk there of, of jeopardizing,

1555
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,500
the whole game because you don't get that feel of

1556
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,600
The of the primary motion, correct?

1557
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,600
And, and again, like I think I said in a previous dream.

1558
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,100
If you don't get that feel correct.

1559
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,300
Nobody is going to play your game long enough to find out the other

1560
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:31,800
good things.

1561
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,700
You may have put in it.

1562
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,200
Your game design may be great.

1563
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,900
But if it feels awful to move the character around people are just

1564
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,900
going to like open it up and play it for a couple seconds ago.

1565
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:40,500
This feels terrible and then shut it off, right?

1566
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:43,900
And, like, you know, whoever's, you know, you try to submit it to a

1567
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,100
competition or something, and the judges play it for five seconds, and

1568
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:47,500
they go.

1569
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,700
Oh, these people, clearly just don't know what they're doing.

1570
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,500
We don't need to play anymore.

1571
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:50,800
More.

1572
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,500
Right?

1573
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,700
And so it jeopardizes the whole game.

1574
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,000
If you don't nail the compulsory.

1575
01:05:59,000 --> 01:05:59,300
It's right.

1576
01:05:59,300 --> 01:05:59,900
If you don't like

1577
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,500
Actually, just absolutely get those basic things that everyone should

1578
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,000
get, right.

1579
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,400
If you don't get those right, you risk ruining all the other things

1580
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,600
that you may have done really well.

1581
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,200
Like you had to have a lot of great ideas that happen at a higher

1582
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,100
level in the game.

1583
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,900
And if you can't get that core, S to S feel, right?

1584
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:22,600
You risk throwing all of that work away and, and having a game a game

1585
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,800
failed at that could have been a success, right?

1586
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,300
And that could have been a lot of fun for a lot of people to play.

1587
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,900
So I can't stress it highly enough that like learning.

1588
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,300
On how to do really good physics based programming which doesn't mean

1589
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,100
simulation.

1590
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,800
It just means understanding the basics equations basic equation of

1591
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,400
motions and getting them, right.

1592
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,400
Is a really, really powerful tool and I highly recommend that everyone

1593
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,400
learn it and you can break the rules as much as you want to.

1594
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,000
Once you learn them, but just don't not learn them because I think it

1595
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,500
will have a lot of really negative consequences for you when you're

1596
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,400
actually trying to make stuff.

1597
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,000
Feel good.

1598
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,300
Why not add an opposite direction or deceleration based on V, when

1599
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,700
collisions occur doing?

1600
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:06,900
This?

1601
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,000
Slowly would allow the character to reach the final pixels.

1602
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Close to the wall.

1603
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,400
Well, so we're going to be doing collision and what happens around

1604
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
walls is very important.

1605
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,900
And so we'll be spending a lot of time on that, a little further down.

1606
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,700
So, so, hold that.

1607
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,800
Thought for when we actually start working with, with, with the wall

1608
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,200
stuff.

1609
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,400
Are you concerned that actual physics will detract from the Purity and

1610
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,200
elegance of the world's greatest jump code?

1611
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,400
For those of you who haven't been with us, the whole time.

1612
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,500
I made some of I was throwing something into demo, something very

1613
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,300
early in the Stream and I made this thing where I just threw a sign

1614
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,700
controller onto some, you don't even want to know what I did, but it

1615
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,500
was awful and I said, I think what I said, I said don't ever write

1616
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,400
this for jump code.

1617
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,500
Yes, I am afraid.

1618
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,100
I guess that might detract, gosh.

1619
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,000
I hope it doesn't.

1620
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,500
Let's see here.

1621
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:12,500
What would you need to store if you wanted to reverse time Allah

1622
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,200
braid?

1623
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:14,800
Well.

1624
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,800
That's kind of an open-ended question.

1625
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:22,300
So, it's hard to say, but it does relate to physics very directly.

1626
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,200
And so, I'll point this out.

1627
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,399
So, the rigid body Dynamics simplification.

1628
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,100
Remember I said we were doing rigid body Dynamics, which is a

1629
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,300
simplification of physics that basically says, all right.

1630
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,600
I've got some collection of atoms, right?

1631
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,000
That makes up, you know, this block that I want to simulate and I'm

1632
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,200
going to simulate it by reducing it down to its Center of mass, which

1633
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,800
is some position.

1634
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:46,600
I did it.

1635
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,500
And it's orientation, right?

1636
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,500
I'm just going to say that.

1637
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,600
That's what I've got.

1638
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,200
And I'm going to simulate just that Center of mass in that

1639
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,899
orientation.

1640
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,399
And I'm going to assume that the whole all the atoms in the block just

1641
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,800
obey that and get moved along with it, right?

1642
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,200
That, that the simplification in that simplification, a lot of things

1643
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,200
just aren't real.

1644
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,300
They don't work the way that they normally do.

1645
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,700
In terms of the microscopic level because we're making a bunch of

1646
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:12,500
simplifications.

1647
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,000
And the I can't see these differences, right?

1648
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,700
The rigid reread.

1649
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,700
The reason rigid body Dynamics is so useful is because it captures

1650
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:22,500
basically all of the interesting things that happen when

1651
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,399
non-deformable objects do stuff.

1652
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,899
Now, there's deformable body Dynamics, which allow things to squish

1653
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:28,800
and do other sorts of things and that's a separate thing as well.

1654
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:29,800
It's another simplification.

1655
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,300
Yeah, but ignoring that for a second.

1656
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,700
So the reason that we use it is because those equations of motion

1657
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,100
capture, all of the things that are I is used to picking up on and we

1658
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:38,399
go.

1659
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:43,200
Okay, good, right, but one of the consequences of it is that it's non

1660
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,899
reversible, right?

1661
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:52,000
So you cannot, for example, take the state of the world, flip all of

1662
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,400
the quantities and run it backwards and get back to where it was 15

1663
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,900
minutes ago, and that's not because of our piecewise.

1664
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,300
Jen.

1665
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,000
Right.

1666
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,100
We have our piecewise approximation is another thing that I'll get to

1667
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:05,900
in a second, but I'm actually talking about the actual

1668
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,900
non-participatory.

1669
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:11,600
If the, you know, if the user wasn't even controlling someone the

1670
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,600
actual non-participatory, rigid body Dynamics are simply

1671
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,400
non-reversible.

1672
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,600
And the reason for that is friction.

1673
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,900
So basically what happens is when something slides along the ground or

1674
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,000
when it hits air resistance, whatever energy is lost from the system

1675
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,400
and things, slow down.

1676
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,800
Now in the real world, that's not

1677
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,400
True, there's all sorts of stuff that happens in physics and I don't

1678
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,900
pretend to know all of this stuff.

1679
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,100
But like, you know, you don't really have stuff.

1680
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,500
Just slow down.

1681
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,700
It produces byproducts like heat that are you know, transferring atoms

1682
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,000
like all the all of the quantum physics is happening.

1683
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,200
There's all the stuff that's happening.

1684
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,500
So to say that it was non-reversible is a very different statement and

1685
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,000
I think that may actually be reversible.

1686
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,100
I don't even know, I don't know where physicists are on that kind of

1687
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,700
stuff they come up with new theories.

1688
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,300
Who knows?

1689
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,800
But what we do know is our simplification is very

1690
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,200
Reversible because basically what happens is the state of the world.

1691
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,500
Let's say this was a Dye, this say this block was a bite, you know, a

1692
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,600
Dye that you play, you know, craps with or whatever you roll this die.

1693
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,300
It comes to rest on the table.

1694
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,200
That's the end of the entire information you have.

1695
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,400
So when that died, you know, it bounces, it comes down here at

1696
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,200
bounces, roles and lands here.

1697
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,500
If I wanted to get back that motion.

1698
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,100
If I wanted to reverse time to, when the dye was in the guy's hand,

1699
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,300
before he rolled the die.

1700
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:29,800
Well,

1701
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,300
I've got no information to do that.

1702
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,200
His velocity right now is 0.

1703
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:37,500
I can't negate it and have him move back to where he was.

1704
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,100
And so, that non reversibility means that in order to do like braids

1705
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:46,300
style, rewind, like you're asking, you actually have to store the

1706
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,600
state of the world, at least at Key Junction points, like when things

1707
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:55,000
stop and when they're not in free form, ballistic phase motion where

1708
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
you know that you can just play it forwards and backwards and I'll be

1709
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,500
the same.

1710
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,400
So anytime there is friction.

1711
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,600
Have that problem because energy is being lost from the system and not

1712
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,700
accounted for anywhere else, right.

1713
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:11,900
Another way to do it would be to record the friction forwards and then

1714
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,400
play it back.

1715
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,700
You know that, whatever, the way braid actually does it, I think is

1716
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,400
just with compressed records per frame.

1717
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,300
Like, I think he actually just compresses like a rewind stream and

1718
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,100
plays that backwards.

1719
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:25,200
I believe I don't remember how John ended up deciding to do that, but

1720
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,100
we would probably have to do similarly, like we'd probably have to do

1721
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,800
something where we stored records.

1722
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,700
Of of guy's paths because these things are non-reversible.

1723
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,900
You can't just play them backwards from state to state.

1724
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,700
You have to actually know what happened to the guy in the past because

1725
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,000
the system is lossy.

1726
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,600
Let's see.

1727
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,400
Is the character a bitmap.

1728
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:56,800
Yes.

1729
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,000
The character is.

1730
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,800
We sewed asset loading.

1731
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:05,600
Like last week ago, I believe and we loaded him in, he's actually

1732
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,100
three bitmaps you'll see.

1733
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,900
Hopefully maybe by the end of the week, but if not, by the end of next

1734
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:13,600
week, he'll also be kind of bouncy because we actually he's made in

1735
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,400
separate pieces.

1736
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,600
And so I he can kind of Bounce and stuff.

1737
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,900
So we'll be doing some more with that.

1738
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,500
Let's see.

1739
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,700
Are we going to normalize the vector from the input instead of just

1740
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,000
having a special case for diagonals?

1741
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:27,600
Yes.

1742
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,900
Well, probably, I mean, I guess we don't have to, but that's how I

1743
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:32,700
would normally do it.

1744
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,600
We didn't do it that way because we hadn't gotten a normalization yet.

1745
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,500
So you're kind of jumping ahead of us.

1746
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:42,300
But, yeah, we will, at least start normalizing things pretty soon in

1747
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,200
some circumstance.

1748
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:44,500
But but yeah.

1749
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,200
Will there eventually be a map function to help determine terrain for

1750
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,600
friction and object collisions?

1751
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:07,700
Probably?

1752
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,800
I haven't super decided what I want to do in terms of whether there

1753
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,000
should be a lot of slidy stuff or slowing down kinds of stuff, but

1754
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,500
that's typical of these sorts of games.

1755
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:21,500
So it's kind of in my head that we will have stuff like that, but I

1756
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,200
haven't specifically thought of what would be super cool about doing

1757
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:24,700
that.

1758
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:27,500
So, I don't know yet, but probably.

1759
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,500
You frequently say that you like names to be descriptive and you

1760
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:40,900
shorten them.

1761
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,900
When you use them often.

1762
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,800
It seems like you use float, 32, or in 32 much more often than

1763
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,300
vectors.

1764
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,100
I'm wondering why V2, instead of vector to, or vector to.

1765
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,800
The answer is actually habit these days.

1766
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,100
I probably would prefer switching to I 32 or u-32 because I would like

1767
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,200
those to actually be shorter.

1768
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,800
And I just haven't done that yet, but that's probably would be better.

1769
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:15,800
Why not break?

1770
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,500
A lot of the super long code out into methods with reasonable names.

1771
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,100
I know it's easy, but it's pretty spaghetti.

1772
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,600
Like, so the reason for that is because we haven't decided what those

1773
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,400
functions should be.

1774
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,700
One of the problems that a lot of people often.

1775
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,200
One of the things a lot of people often do is they break things into

1776
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:31,600
functions.

1777
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,300
Prematurely.

1778
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,700
So the thing that I will point out here is that this only gets done

1779
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,200
once.

1780
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,100
So the only point in breaking into function, is to make it more

1781
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:43,100
readable by introducing a name like update player position, right?

1782
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,200
But we don't know if he actually want an update player position

1783
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,100
function yet because probably will be wanting to use this sort of

1784
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,300
stuff for updating more than just the player, right, but we don't know

1785
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,600
what that's going to look like as we haven't had in a monster and so

1786
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:54,900
on.

1787
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,000
So I try to really emphasize not breaking things out into functions,

1788
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,800
until you know, what they're actually supposed to do, and then you

1789
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,900
break them out into functions.

1790
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,100
There's nothing particularly spaghetti about it.

1791
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,600
Like what's the spaghetti part?

1792
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,600
It's just a lengthy function.

1793
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,100
It will do nothing differently.

1794
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,700
When I move it out into a separate function.

1795
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,100
You'll do exactly the same thing.

1796
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,100
So thinking somehow,

1797
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,300
How that it created spaghetti - by having it in one function in that

1798
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,000
it's less spaghetti, to move it out.

1799
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,200
Is also a bit of a false idea, in some sense.

1800
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,300
All you've done is made it harder for people to read the code, what it

1801
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,900
actually does, and made it easier for them to read the code.

1802
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,400
What it's semantically does, which is sometimes a good trade-off to

1803
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,900
make, but it doesn't make the code any better.

1804
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,600
Shouldn't you use a max speed variable?

1805
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,400
Well, I don't know.

1806
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,100
That depends on what we want to do.

1807
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,300
Maybe maybe not.

1808
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,200
Maybe we want the player to not really have a maximum speed.

1809
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,800
We want them to be able to go as fast as they want to subject to a

1810
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,500
bunch of forces in the environment.

1811
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,000
So if they happen to float out into space somehow in some level of the

1812
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,800
game, they could just go as fast as they wanted to because there'd be

1813
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,400
no friction.

1814
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,300
So I don't know, a max speed variable is kind of an artificial

1815
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,700
construct and I don't know that.

1816
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,400
I particularly think it's all that interesting.

1817
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,500
Let's see.

1818
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,400
So somebody says, friction negative acceleration based on current

1819
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,400
velocity would feel much better in my opinion.

1820
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:41,800
But that's what we did.

1821
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,200
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

1822
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,700
That is exactly what this is.

1823
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That is the friction.

1824
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,500
That is a negative acceleration based on the current velocity.

1825
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,400
That is literally this line of code.

1826
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,200
So I'm not sure what you're talking about.

1827
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,200
Exactly, but

1828
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,200
Yeah, if you could be more specific about what that question was,

1829
01:17:59,300 --> 01:17:59,800
that's easy.

1830
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,900
Zero wer, I could I could address it.

1831
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,200
Can you derive the one half?

1832
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,800
Ay, t squared, part of the position equation?

1833
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,200
Again?

1834
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,500
I didn't quite follow the integration derivation flow.

1835
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,300
Sure.

1836
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,600
And in fact, I can do it in either way.

1837
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,500
I did it kind of the cheesy way because I'm not much of a I'm not very

1838
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,400
good at integration.

1839
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,900
So usually the way I remember stuff is to do derivatives.

1840
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,200
I always remember how to do derivatives and I do those first, but I

1841
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,000
can do it actually.

1842
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,700
Either way.

1843
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,800
I'm not so bad at integration that I couldn't do it either way.

1844
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
So here's the derivative way.

1845
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,700
And here's the integration way.

1846
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,400
Okay.

1847
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:44,800
So doing it.

1848
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:50,300
The derivative way would basically would basically be saying, okay.

1849
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,300
I know that I essentially have

1850
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,500
the function for position.

1851
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,300
Is going to equal something, right?

1852
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,700
I have some acceleration times the squared.

1853
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,100
I know that it's going to be a squared.

1854
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:10,600
I know that it's going to be a squared time term.

1855
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,400
And the reason that I know that it's going to be a squared time term

1856
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,200
is because I know that I'm going to take two derivatives and each time

1857
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,900
you take a derivative you lose one power of T, right.

1858
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,900
So I know that in order for the, a to still exist down here, it would

1859
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,100
have to start out with t squared.

1860
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:30,500
Again, just talking through my thought process on how I do these.

1861
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,000
So if I have acceleration times t squared.

1862
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,400
I know I'd have velocity times T.

1863
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,500
And I know I'd have the old position.

1864
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:38,000
Right?

1865
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,500
So F of 0, if you want to think of it that way, right or pee, right?

1866
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:46,200
So whatever the old, whatever the position was at time, 0, that's what

1867
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:46,900
I've got here.

1868
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,800
So, I know that I'm going to take the old position.

1869
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,600
I'm going to add the velocity times time.

1870
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,400
I'm going to add the acceleration acceleration times t squared, right?

1871
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,100
So if I actually just go do derivatives on this.

1872
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,600
Now, take the derivative.

1873
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,000
I would get to 80, right?

1874
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,300
That's the derivative of this term plus v.

1875
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:04,900
Right?

1876
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,900
The T goes away.

1877
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,800
Plus nothing because this is this has no tea in it.

1878
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,200
So it disappears entirely.

1879
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:12,700
Right?

1880
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,200
Take the derivative again the V goes away and I'm left with just the

1881
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,000
to a right, right.

1882
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So I'm just that's just straight derivatives going down, right?

1883
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,900
And what you'll notice is, when I get to the bottom here, I've got to

1884
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:27,900
a.

1885
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:33,000
So if I was to use this as the equation of motion, I would always have

1886
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,100
to think about my acceleration as actually being half of what I

1887
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,000
actually am going to use to plug in.

1888
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,800
And so really all I'm doing here when I say the 1/2 a tea is I'm

1889
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:49,100
saying, okay, let's pre divide this by one half so that all the

1890
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,400
equations can be just in a as the thing that I plug in is Michael.

1891
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,200
Asia, right.

1892
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,500
That's what actually I was doing in my head in order to do the

1893
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,200
derivative.

1894
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,800
Now the cleaner way to do this, if you

1895
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,400
Actually know how to do math, which, like I said, I don't is to just

1896
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,900
remember how to do integration.

1897
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,500
And so to do in to, because that's the, that's the way you'd like to

1898
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,100
be able to do it.

1899
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:11,000
If you're a math person, it's good.

1900
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,000
You just say I know that I've got an acceleration.

1901
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,300
I now want to determine what is the velocity, right?

1902
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:20,400
So you just have to integrate it up once and in order to integrate up

1903
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:25,100
something once remember you, you raise the power of T1, right?

1904
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,700
So you're going to get an 80, you raise property one and then you add

1905
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,400
a constant, right?

1906
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
It is whatever was there that got knocked out.

1907
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,200
When we did the derivative, right?

1908
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,400
And again, that's whatever the starting velocity was.

1909
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,900
Right, right?

1910
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:38,500
This.

1911
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,900
I should probably write this better.

1912
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,200
This is f Prime of 0, right?

1913
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,400
And this is f Prime of 0, right?

1914
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,100
So velocity is, is that?

1915
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,600
Just, you know, I can keep writing it this way, though.

1916
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,300
So, it's easier to write.

1917
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:53,900
So, there we go.

1918
01:21:55,500 --> 01:22:00,500
Yeah, I guess I should just say F of 0 equals p f.

1919
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,600
Prime of 0 equals v.

1920
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:08,100
F double Prime of 0, equals a right position velocity acceleration and

1921
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:10,400
I kind of use them interchangeably, which again is not, you know,

1922
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:10,700
math.

1923
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:13,500
People would not probably like how fast and loose I play with that.

1924
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,600
And again, like I said, it's because I'm not very good at math.

1925
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,300
So in my head they all kind of get jumbled, I think of them as both

1926
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:18,500
ways.

1927
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:22,400
I think of them as a function that's getting derived twice and I are

1928
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,400
just having a strip of Taken twice.

1929
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,900
And I also think of it as position velocity acceleration, right?

1930
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,600
I just, they're all kind of mixed up in there.

1931
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,400
So anyway, I take the integral once and then you take the integral

1932
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,700
again, right?

1933
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,300
And so, again, you have to do that process in Reverse.

1934
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:41,200
You have to say, Okay, this this obviously is going up to t squared,

1935
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,500
which means that I was multiplying by 2.

1936
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,000
So that means I have to divide by 2, to find out what the coefficient

1937
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,400
is this time, which is the one-half, this guy has to have his power of

1938
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:50,400
T raised again.

1939
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,600
So there's TV right integration and then there's the constant which

1940
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,400
again is the old

1941
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,600
even so this is actually the cleaner way to do it is to just start

1942
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,800
with the A and go up, right?

1943
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,500
But I have a hard time remembering how to integrate some time.

1944
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,500
So I like to just do the do derivatives down and it's then it's clear

1945
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,000
how you do them.

1946
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,400
If I think about doing the derivative in Reverse, I can remember how

1947
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,800
to integrate, but if I don't, I can't.

1948
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,400
So, I don't know.

1949
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,700
So that's it.

1950
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,200
So hopefully that's pretty clear how that works.

1951
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,400
It's pretty straightforward.

1952
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,400
And if you don't know how to do this stuff, Thomas,

1953
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,000
And Fini.

1954
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,100
Is your go-to location by this textbook?

1955
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,200
It is an excellent calculus textbook and you can learn how to do all

1956
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,200
the calculus that you want to do.

1957
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,500
Even.

1958
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,700
I think I feel like it even has the garage multipliers one of my

1959
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:43,800
favorite things ever, but Grand multipliers.

1960
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:45,700
All right.

1961
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,500
We're not gonna talk about LaGrange multipliers right now.

1962
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:48,900
Okay.

1963
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,200
Do you feel something like bullet or box2d of player?

1964
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,800
Movement is appropriate every time.

1965
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,200
Right.

1966
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,300
It's been too fiddly to get stable response.

1967
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,100
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

1968
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,200
I don't know much about those specifically but that I share your

1969
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,100
concerns.

1970
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,700
A lot of times when I've had experience with physics code that was

1971
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:16,700
supposed to be like full physical simulation, kinds of code.

1972
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,900
I find that it is pretty fiddly.

1973
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,700
And so usually, and especially for a game like this, where it's an

1974
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,100
action, any kind of game that's not supposed to be simulating about

1975
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,500
like there's not going to be crate, stacking, puzzles, or whatever,

1976
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,000
right?

1977
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:33,700
What I tend to do is I tend to like I like I was sort of suggesting as

1978
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,500
a good idea there.

1979
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:39,000
I tried to start with a sound physical basis, for what I'm doing.

1980
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,300
So that I know that my motion will be mostly correct.

1981
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:44,700
And then I back it off to be whatever I wanted to happen in gameplay.

1982
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:48,200
And I find that that's a really good approach using a full physics

1983
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,900
simulator to do stuff while it has some advantages.

1984
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,400
I find that they are.

1985
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,200
Oftentimes like you said very unreliable, very difficult to control.

1986
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,400
They can be crashy.

1987
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,700
They can have a lot of bugs in them just by the nature.

1988
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:00,700
Of physics.

1989
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,700
It's not necessarily because like bullet or box2d is bad.

1990
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,800
It's because physics simulation actually to do everything right and to

1991
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,300
get everything.

1992
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,000
Correct is actually very difficult.

1993
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,400
And so, there's just a lot of drawbacks there.

1994
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,200
And so, if you can, if you can come up with ways of getting real

1995
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,000
physics into something that is itself, not a full physical simulation

1996
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,900
that can often be the Best of Both Worlds, but sometimes you don't

1997
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:23,900
have that option because sometimes you really need, if you're trying

1998
01:25:23,900 --> 01:25:26,500
to do stuff with all that real physical object interaction.

1999
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,600
Sometimes you really need full physics.

2000
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
And then, you know, you got

2001
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,100
Gotta You Gotta Have It?

2002
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:39,300
Let's see.

2003
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,800
When would you want to use other integration methods?

2004
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,000
I've read boiler is great for everything.

2005
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,500
So actually isn't this already Euler.

2006
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,100
This is forward Euler.

2007
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,700
Are you thinking of backwards, Euler?

2008
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:53,800
All right.

2009
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,300
So those are numerical integration techniques so we can start with

2010
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:57,800
that.

2011
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,800
And also this is actually not really integrating in any particular

2012
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:02,000
way.

2013
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,900
Like the sort of stuff that you're probably thinking of where you have

2014
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:07,900
to take large Solutions of things.

2015
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,500
Let's, let's table that for some other time because that's like a very

2016
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,900
that kind of question is is probably best left for when we have

2017
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:19,400
something a little more complicated that we might actually want to

2018
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,300
consider something like backwards or therefore, which I don't know if

2019
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:22,200
we're ever going to get to.

2020
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,100
But

2021
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:27,000
Like stable numerical integration is not necessary for what we're

2022
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,500
doing right here because we're never going to get into a situation

2023
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,600
where this wouldn't be stable.

2024
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,300
And so thinking about things like the choice of integrator is not

2025
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,700
particularly important.

2026
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,500
And so I just don't know if that's ever going to be within the scope

2027
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,700
of this of what we're doing.

2028
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,700
But yeah, it's a good question.

2029
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,100
And then I hit return and find out that he wanted to correct.

2030
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:52,500
That question to, I've read order isn't great for everything that

2031
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,100
makes more sense.

2032
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,800
I was like, why are you saying that we're not doing well.

2033
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,100
I'm like, we're doing it for words or there.

2034
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,500
Maybe you're thinking backwards or I don't know.

2035
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,700
Okay, so let me let me address that slightly then because I can answer

2036
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:04,400
your question a little bit better if that's if that's what you're

2037
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,000
thinking about.

2038
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:09,000
So the reason that sometimes you have problems with integration

2039
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,300
systems is because they can get out of control very quickly.

2040
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,300
So the problem is, if you think about what happens here, there is a

2041
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:18,900
Time step, right?

2042
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,200
And that time step.

2043
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,900
Like I said, we're pretending starts at zero.

2044
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,100
We're running it to F delta T, and we're basically saying, we have

2045
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:30,100
some function that says, where our guy is going to be over that time

2046
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:30,600
step.

2047
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:34,100
Now, what can happen is, you can have certain equations of motion.

2048
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:37,100
This is probably not going to be one of them because of how simple

2049
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,400
we've set up things to be.

2050
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,400
But if you had a complex system of stuff that was pushing on each

2051
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,200
other or doing whatever it was going to do, you can get into

2052
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:47,300
situations where the function that you're that, you're trying to

2053
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:51,000
represent has some very critically bad behavior.

2054
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:54,800
When you try to integrate it, and typically, when you're looking at

2055
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,700
things like this, you're talking about doing integration.

2056
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,800
That's not analytic integration like this.

2057
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,500
This is, this is actually fairly analytical integration.

2058
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,000
We've actually created the full equation for position.

2059
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,500
We've just created a piecewise and we're just flat-out solving it.

2060
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,400
Right?

2061
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:15,900
But what happens, a lot of other times is, you're actually doing these

2062
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:19,300
equations of motion as approximations to things that are actually a

2063
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,300
lot more complicated.

2064
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,100
So instead of

2065
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,500
This is the actual equation of motion for the guy.

2066
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,300
This is actually what it should be and we're just actually solving it.

2067
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,100
But if instead, what we were going to do is basically Point sample.

2068
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,700
Some set of information for this acceleration right where instead of

2069
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:37,700
saying well, we're just assuming that the guy holds down whatever key

2070
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,400
heels down in the end the guy moves in that direction or whatever,

2071
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:40,900
right?

2072
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,900
Let's say that we had some really complex physics function here that

2073
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:47,000
was going to produce the acceleration right here.

2074
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,600
And then we're going to assume that over this time step that that

2075
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,100
acceleration is constant and we're going to

2076
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,800
All up to see what the equations are.

2077
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,900
Well, that could be very dangerous.

2078
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:58,800
If these equations are very stiff and what that means, the stiffness

2079
01:28:59,200 --> 01:28:59,900
part of it means.

2080
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:03,900
If they have some very sharp, should I explain this?

2081
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,300
We're, this is, this is really an exploration that's way ahead of

2082
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:06,700
where we are.

2083
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:09,000
So I'm trying to think of how to explain this in some kind of nice

2084
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:09,300
way.

2085
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:11,500
All right.

2086
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,700
Suppose s'posin.

2087
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:17,500
Here we go.

2088
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,100
Supposin.

2089
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:29,500
I was to tell you that I wanted to integrate this like function here.

2090
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:31,200
Right?

2091
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,100
And I wanted to be able to basically say, alright, what we're going to

2092
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:38,600
do is we've got a frame time steps, right?

2093
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,700
And I want to basically say, I want to trace out this path, but I'm

2094
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,100
only going to actually be able to sample at certain points in the

2095
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:50,300
path, right?

2096
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,500
And what you have to remember is the state of the world, right?

2097
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,900
The state of if these equations of motion, get more complicated, then.

2098
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,700
We don't actually know what they actually look like in practice.

2099
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:06,300
That's when you have to go up to more fancy Mass.

2100
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,800
Like I said, I'm kind of dancing around this year.

2101
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,700
But what you have to imagine is that you're actually in a field of

2102
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,200
functions, right?

2103
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,700
That look that basically like there's a family of functions and you

2104
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,500
don't know actually where the one is that you're trying to follow.

2105
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,100
Okay.

2106
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,800
And so at any point in this field space I can basically say, all

2107
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:29,000
right, wherever I am tell me what the derivative of this function is.

2108
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:29,900
I'm going to step.

2109
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Up the equations of motion forward to the next time.

2110
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,500
Step, and that's where I'm going to say.

2111
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,200
Everyone is.

2112
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:36,900
And then I'm going to look again, and I'm going to look at the

2113
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,400
derivative and I'm gonna do the same thing.

2114
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,000
Right?

2115
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,000
Well, what ends up happening, if you have these sorts of situations

2116
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,900
where the equations are complicated enough, that you can't write those

2117
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,800
simple closed-form things.

2118
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,000
Like, what I just did is you can see that you get into problems very

2119
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,300
quickly because what's the derivative here or the derivative points up

2120
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,100
in that direction?

2121
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,100
I step that far and I get to my next time step and I say, okay, I'm

2122
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:56,400
here.

2123
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,100
What's the derivative?

2124
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,100
Well, the derivatives is really steep thing that goes up there.

2125
01:30:59,400 --> 01:30:59,900
I come here.

2126
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:00,400
Here.

2127
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,400
And I go out to here and I go.

2128
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,300
Oh, all right, bad news guys.

2129
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,000
We're nowhere near the old function, but I don't know that because I

2130
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,400
don't know what the function actually is.

2131
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,400
I just know it's this very complex thing that can't be analytically

2132
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,200
integrated.

2133
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:17,100
So, now, I'm here, I take the sample of, with the derivatives there

2134
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:19,500
and the derivative is pointing back down here, right?

2135
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,500
So basically, I step down here, and I get here and, you know, maybe

2136
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,000
this thing curves up again, or whatever.

2137
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,700
And so, I step out there and what can happen if you're in a very bad

2138
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,800
situation where these lines kind of,

2139
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:31,200
All go up like that.

2140
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,700
Like let's say that they look kind of more like this sort of a thing.

2141
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,500
You could get into a situation where you just fly off into space and

2142
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,300
you're nowhere near the old thing that you were.

2143
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,400
If you're doing forwards Oiler, which is the name for the kind of

2144
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,700
integration that you do where you just sample, the derivative and step

2145
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:46,900
forward, right?

2146
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,500
One solution to this is backwards other.

2147
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,800
And this is why I said, when you said I've read or Euler isn't great

2148
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:54,300
for everything.

2149
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,100
It's forwards.

2150
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:55,500
Euler.

2151
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,800
That isn't great for everything.

2152
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,200
It's forward Euler.

2153
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,700
That's not great for games.

2154
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,900
Backward, Euler is actually very good and what backwards Euler is

2155
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:05,500
backwards.

2156
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:10,700
Euler is when you go to the time, step that you would next be on.

2157
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,700
So, instead of doing it this way, where we took the derivative and

2158
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,000
step forwards, instead.

2159
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,500
What you do is you go to the next time step and you search along this

2160
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:23,900
line, essentially for where points back to the place that you were at.

2161
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,300
So it solves it in reverse.

2162
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,500
What that means is you can never have

2163
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,900
I'm out here because this guy pointed in a totally different

2164
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:30,800
direction, right?

2165
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,600
So what would happen when we took this time steps, we'd come here and

2166
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,500
we'd look for some point in this in this area that pointed back to

2167
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,500
where this was.

2168
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,000
Right?

2169
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:42,100
So it would be somewhere that was kind of like down here, right?

2170
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:46,000
It would be off the curve but it would be off the curve in a less

2171
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,700
energetic place, right?

2172
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:51,200
So it would it sucks the energy out of the system and bring things

2173
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,800
back to rest when it is wrong, rather than flying them off in the

2174
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,600
middle of nowhere.

2175
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,000
When it is wrong, right?

2176
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,800
And so backwards Euler is actually very good.

2177
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,700
But it's much more expensive which is why you often don't do it.

2178
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:06,100
So I don't really want you to think about what we're doing, as forward

2179
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,800
Euler though, because this is this, all this stuff is stuff.

2180
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,300
That is way outside the scope of what we're doing.

2181
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:16,600
This is numerical integration and we're not really doing numerical

2182
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,400
integration.

2183
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,000
We're basically doing analytical integration.

2184
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,700
We're just doing piecewise analytical which I realize sounds like

2185
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,300
hand-waving because piecewise analytical.

2186
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,500
Why isn't that numerical?

2187
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:29,800
Well, it's because we actually I'm actually saying these are actually

2188
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,200
The equations of motion for the guy and they just happen to.

2189
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:36,400
We just happen to change what the constants are when the user pushes

2190
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,800
the button, right, but we know what they are and we can integrate them

2191
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:39,900
up.

2192
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,500
Analytically.

2193
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:41,600
I just did it for you.

2194
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,500
We showed the one half.

2195
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:43,200
Ay, T Square thing.

2196
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,600
And so so we're not really doing something that falls into this

2197
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,300
category.

2198
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,300
So hopefully that answers the question there and we're kind of way

2199
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,300
over time here, but let me just take a look and see if there's

2200
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,000
anything else.

2201
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,900
Let's see.

2202
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:01,900
Let's see.

2203
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,600
Yes, I was going for a figure skating analogy when I said you have to

2204
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:15,600
nail the compulsories.

2205
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:20,100
Let's see.

2206
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:24,800
We use rigid body even after the hero gets his three parts bouncing

2207
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,200
all that.

2208
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:25,400
Yes.

2209
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,000
We will.

2210
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,700
I'm only going to do the deformable stuff on him.

2211
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:33,000
Non-physically mean the deformability will be purely a graphics

2212
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:33,300
effect.

2213
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:38,000
It will not be based on solving any kind of gelatinous equations to

2214
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,500
make him like, you know, gelatinous around or anything.

2215
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,100
Let's see.

2216
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:02,900
EB 0wr, I'm sorry.

2217
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:05,300
I meant that you could take some constant friction and increase it

2218
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:08,500
exponentially, as velocity decreases so that the character would stop

2219
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,400
much faster in the end of its movement without that sliding.

2220
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,400
I am running forward, I suppose, but whatever.

2221
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,900
Yes, so I do agree with you.

2222
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:18,800
We probably will do something different for his motion.

2223
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,300
Eventually that has some slightly different properties.

2224
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,300
But yeah, you're jumping ahead a little bit too much.

2225
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,300
Remember, we got to go one step at a time.

2226
01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:27,000
So we don't leave too much stuff on explained.

2227
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,000
If we had to rain ice or mud, we could use that as the scalar for the

2228
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,900
friction deceleration.

2229
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,800
And with almost one additional line of code from today.

2230
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,800
We'd have something convincing somewhat convincing interaction.

2231
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,000
Yes, that is absolutely correct.

2232
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,600
And that's again, one of the reasons to frame it correctly as

2233
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,700
equations of motion and friction, is because you don't have to do any

2234
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,800
extra work to figure out how those things would be.

2235
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,600
You just literally are changing, whatever that coefficient of friction

2236
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,300
is and that'll get even more true as we do sort of more physically

2237
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:16,900
stuff in there.

2238
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:17,900
All right.

2239
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,800
I think we are done with questions for now because we are out of time.

2240
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,500
I think I got all the ones that pertained to the actual stream.

2241
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,800
Anyway, again, if you're asking a bunch of questions that have nothing

2242
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:29,100
to do with the stream that we were just doing or that or a previous

2243
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:29,800
day's code.

2244
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,100
Come if you want to ask those questions, I will answer them.

2245
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:36,300
Just come to a come 15 minutes before the scheduled start time, and I

2246
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:38,400
will answer them on the pre stream.

2247
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:39,500
Okay?

2248
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,500
Thank you everyone for joining me.

2249
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,600
For a very mathy, handmade hero today.

2250
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:45,800
I'm very happy with where our guy is now though.

2251
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,500
It just feels so much better already.

2252
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,900
There's a bunch of things.

2253
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,100
I still want to do the movement coach.

2254
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,600
It still doesn't feel as good as I wanted to, but of course, we're

2255
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,400
definitely at the park where it's like, okay, I could see actually

2256
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:56,200
playing with this guy.

2257
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,800
Now rather than, than before, it was just awful.

2258
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,800
And so we're getting there.

2259
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:03,100
Baby steps and we'll make some more baby steps tomorrow and we'll

2260
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,900
start to get into some pretty respectable territory.

2261
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,100
I think and that's always a good thing.

2262
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,100
So thank you very much for joining me.

2263
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:12,600
It has been a pleasure coding with you, as always again.

2264
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,600
If Hoops.

2265
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,100
What is that?

2266
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,000
I don't want you to save anything from here.

2267
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,100
No, discard discard clothes, clothes and discard.

2268
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:20,300
Okay.

2269
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:20,800
There we go.

2270
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:26,300
Again, if you would like to have access to the source code, you can

2271
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,800
pre-order the game on handmade hero dot org.

2272
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:32,400
And that gives you full nightly access to the source code, which I

2273
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,100
update every time after we're done coding.

2274
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,700
So if you're interested in that, all you have to do is pre order and

2275
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:38,700
you can download any time you want follow along at home.

2276
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:40,100
Try playing with code yourself.

2277
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:41,600
If you want to make changes and see how they work.

2278
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,300
That's also pretty good and it comes with the art assets as well for

2279
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,900
the all the stuff that we use on the stream for development are

2280
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:48,800
included in there as well.

2281
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,700
So that's kind of fun too.

2282
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:51,700
So, you know when you try stuff out home, it'll actually

2283
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,800
Like it does on the stream.

2284
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,300
We also have patreon.

2285
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:57,700
If you want to support our sorry patreon, if you want to support the

2286
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:00,800
video series, you can click on that link and subscribe and there.

2287
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,300
And we also have a cool site that a lot of people have spent some some

2288
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:06,600
pretty significant time, making making pretty awesome.

2289
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,700
There's the news in form.

2290
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:09,500
So if you're trying to learn from a stream, I highly recommend it.

2291
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:10,300
There's an episode guide.

2292
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:12,200
Newly updated episode guide actually.

2293
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,900
So it's got a nice index page.

2294
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,000
Now that's got some cool stuff on it to that.

2295
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,300
We've now synchronized it's pretty sweet.

2296
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,200
A lot of folks up here that you see in here.

2297
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,600
I've done a lot of really great work on it.

2298
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:21,900
It.

2299
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,100
So if you're trying to catch up with old episodes, I highly recommend

2300
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:24,600
going in there.

2301
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,800
It's got some great stuff.

2302
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,800
If you click through on the episodes got like, time-coded Jump Markers

2303
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,400
and all this stuff.

2304
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:30,100
It's really awesome.

2305
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:34,100
There's a coding resources page where you can look at ports to Mac OS,

2306
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:36,500
X or Linux, if you're interested in that sort of stuff and other sorts

2307
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,100
of things you might be interested in.

2308
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:39,800
And finally, there is a game.

2309
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,300
I'm sorry, a code discussion forum.

2310
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:43,900
If you can jump to, where you can ask questions of stuff like that, if

2311
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,900
you're having trouble, or if you just want to talk about something

2312
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,900
that we've done in a little more detail, so I highly recommend, if

2313
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,600
you're learning to try to learn from a series to check that out.

2314
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,500
It's great place to go.

2315
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
So thank you, everyone.

2316
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:54,000
Tomorrow.

2317
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,700
I believe is today, Thursday.

2318
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,500
I want to say is that true?

2319
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:58,800
No, today's Wednesday.

2320
01:38:58,900 --> 01:38:59,800
So we've got one more.

2321
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,400
We've got tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.

2322
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,300
Pacific Standard time.

2323
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:04,500
So I will see you here tomorrow at 8 p.m.

2324
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,100
Pacific Standard time, and then Friday, of course, is early morning

2325
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:07,300
stream.

2326
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:08,000
That's 9 a.m.

2327
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,400
Or so.

2328
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,600
I usually see these folks in Europe at that time, but but tomorrow, I

2329
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,400
hope to see you all again.

2330
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:12,800
8 p.m.

2331
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,200
Pacific Standard time for some more player movement code, and now that

2332
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:18,300
we got the equations of motion out of the way.

2333
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:22,400
I think it should be simpler for us to kind of do do a few more things

2334
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,500
in short order.

2335
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:26,600
So, thank you everyone for joining me and I hope to see you tomorrow.
