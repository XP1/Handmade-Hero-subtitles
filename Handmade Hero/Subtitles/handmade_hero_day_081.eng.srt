00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,000
The show where we code a complete game live on Twitch every night,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,600
except not the past two nights, because I was away on business and

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,300
almost not tonight because I was on a train back from Portland.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,200
I live in Seattle and I was in Portland, Oregon.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,500
And what happened was, I guess the train in front of us, hit a

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,700
pedestrian, which does not sound remotely Pleasant for The Pedestrian.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,600
And I guess, when that happens, right, I mean, not a common Occurrence

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,200
at least, hopefully not a common occurrence, but I'm assuming that

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,500
there is a lot of stuff that has to go on.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,700
First of all obviously you're going to have the whole Medical

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,700
Response, you know, I don't know if the person was all right, or what

13
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,300
happened but then I'm assuming

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,900
Being that in order for the trains to run.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,200
Again, you have to inspect the tracks and the trains and all these are

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,800
the sort of stuff.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,100
So they basically came on, you know, our train was stopped at Tacoma

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,400
Station and they basically came on and said, all right, look at right

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,700
in front of us, hit a pedestrian.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,600
They called it a regrettable incident.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,500
That was the word.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,300
They use to describe it.

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
They were like there has been a regrettable incident.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,200
And so, you know, I'm actually kind of mildly amused by this because,

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,100
obviously, I don't have

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Any connections especially don't know who they were.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm not having like an emotional response or anything to it, but the

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,200
fact that they called hitting a pedestrian, a regrettable incident

29
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
already kind of hits.

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
My satire boat.

31
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm like, well, yeah, I mean, that it's pretty regrettable that's

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
that's for sure.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,300
Like, if there are things you're going to regret it be like the time.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,300
I ran over that guy with a train is definitely one thing you might

35
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,100
regret but you know I'm like all right so I'm like okay that's fine.

36
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,100
So

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,800
Sitting in the chair, they finished making this announcement.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
They're based like, you know, could be an hour or two delay you know,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,800
we don't know, it could be a very long time so we'll let you know as

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,900
soon as we know something, they undo their their microphone thing

41
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,100
right?

42
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,900
They stop.

43
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,000
And I'm like, okay, I guess we'll be sitting here for a while.

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,800
15 seconds later.

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
I mean, maybe 30 seconds, right?

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,700
But, but less than a minute, they come back on and I'm thinking oh,

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,500
they must have like gotten word now.

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Like they must have gotten some information back about like you know,

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,700
whether it was the person, okay, well the trains be able to run, you

50
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,000
know, whatever and they're going to tell us about it.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,400
No.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,500
They come back on and they say and this is an announcement from the

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,600
dining car.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,800
The dining car is open so if anyone wants to get any snacks or alcohol

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
we have alcohol candy and so they rolled straight from.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
We hit a pedestrian to this would be a good time for you to take

57
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,600
advantage of our dining car.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,800
It's like we ran over somebody time for dinner.

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,800
I can't argue with the logic about the efficiency of the situation,

60
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,100
but I do feel like, at least in most cultures, I guess I don't know

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,600
that much about cultures worldwide, but in a lot of Western cultures

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,100
there's a little bit of period of mourning typically, that's sort of

63
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,000
implied for respecting people after you, run over them with a train to

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,200
be to say the very least, but you know what you going to do?

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,100
So anyway, I was lucky enough to have

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,400
My wife sort of tell me because I was, I was able to use the, she was

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,900
still back in Seattle and I was able to use the Wi-Fi on the train.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,100
She was like, well, you know, there's a bus that goes from, like, not

69
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,400
far from that train station up to Seattle, like, maybe you can go

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
catch it.

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,200
And so, like, I did and, and I'm very glad I did because the train as

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,400
far as I can tell, from looking at the Amtrak site is still at that

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,100
station.

74
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,100
So, unless

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
SI streamed handmade hero over the Wi-Fi on the train, which let me

76
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,900
tell you.

77
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,400
If you think some nights we've had bad streaming problems from this

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,000
set up.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,600
I don't even want to know what that would be like but that's you know,

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,600
that's a, that was the other option.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
So thankfully that worked out.

82
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,600
I got home, okay?

83
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,000
And and handmade hero can continue.

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Hopefully we will be able to get through this stream without a

85
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,200
regrettable incident.

86
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,200
And with that said, let's go ahead and get started.

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,000
So if you are following along at home and you have pre-ordered, the

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
game on handmade hero dot-org, you can go ahead and unzip the source

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,500
code today.

90
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
80, we're on day 81, right here.

91
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,000
So unzip date, 80 source code and that is the source code that I'm

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,400
starting with right now.

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,800
And that is what you'll want to follow along with at home now.

94
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Personally.

95
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,600
I am feeling a bit drained from this travel Extravaganza.

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,200
I had been supposed to get in at 5:30 which would have had time for me

97
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,100
to relax and get ready to do some.

98
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,000
Handmade here are programming but that didn't happen at all.

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,400
And so I kind of feel like I would like to do something a little light

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,300
and fluffy.

101
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,600
It's just you know, just to sort of ease into it.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,100
So I'm not I'm not heading straight from running over a pedestrian

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,500
with train to and happen.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,400
Take the bus to get here on time.

105
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,300
Blah blah blah, all the way too hard Collision detection problem or

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,000
something like this, where I'm going to have to focus on things too

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,300
much.

108
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,700
So, I'm wondering if there's something in this to-do list here, that

109
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,200
would be a little bit lighter for us to do.

110
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Maybe something that, you know, we could kind of play with it.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,700
That wouldn't really be super serious, hardcore hour and be something,

112
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,200
maybe a little bit fluffier, and

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,100
And I don't know.

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,800
We have

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,200
In.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,900
Well, this was kind of just our brainstorming or like Kirsten things

117
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,000
that we might want to do and so I don't know what, what I think I

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
might do.

119
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,400
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,100
What I think I might do is maybe we should try to add some sort of

121
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,000
drawing to the the ground because it's kind of weird.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,200
Like when we don't really have much in the way of rendering and that

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
was fine because we're not really working focusing on that right now.

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,900
But we kind of don't have any real.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,700
Real way of seeing the floor there.

126
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,800
You know, we kind of Drew in those trees to show the boundary of a

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,500
room, but we never actually Drew anything for the floor.

128
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,400
And so as a result, you know, you go upstairs, you go downstairs.

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,500
There's no real indication of where the floor is.

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,400
We're just kind of drawing some representative stuffs, so we can kind

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,500
of see, you know, a representational version of what's going on and

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
know that it's sort of working.

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,900
But that's, you know, that's not maybe, perhaps,

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,200
so interesting, so if we wanted to take care of that,

135
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,800
I was trying to think of what we could do.

136
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,500
That would be relatively simple and in the direction of the sorts of

137
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,900
stuff that will do when we go to the renderer for real.

138
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,600
And so if you remember what we've got in that art directory, there,

139
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,200
the stuff that's already checked checked in quote unquote, I guess

140
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,300
we're not really checked in but that's in the project in that data

141
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
directory, right?

142
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,000
That test to thing, I checked in had some of these, like, ground

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Splats in them.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:34,900
And of course,

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can't believe you them in Windows picture viewer because for some

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,900
reason it doesn't work.

147
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,700
But you know if if I edit with gimp and load those into to a

148
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:50,400
reel-to-reel image viewing thing, you can actually see that they're

149
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,300
alpha'd.

150
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,800
So that they're kind of like these ground Splats that are meant to

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,300
allow you to kind of build up a little bit of ground as you go, right.

152
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,000
You can kind of see that it's like a little bit of like this is a

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,900
little bit of like a stone thing but it's got

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Some sort of transparency in it.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And, and here's another one, right?

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,100
That would go on top of that, that kind of smushed together to make

157
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,400
like a stone, a stone or dirt area, right?

158
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,300
Same with this one, and this one, right?

159
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,100
So they're just like a couple things that you could smush together to

160
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,200
make sort of an abstract, Stoney, kind of texture on the ground.

161
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,400
And similarly, I don't know why it opened that many versions of gimp

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,700
for me.

163
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,000
I really didn't need that many.

164
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,299
Leave.

165
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:39,700
There's like some grass Tufts that can go on there, right?

166
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go ahead and grab those up and also some grass that works the

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,200
same way as the stone right here are some some some Alpha grass

168
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,700
things.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,800
And so, you know, if you think about kind of how these are meant to

170
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,600
work to just build a little bit of a background, if I was to cut and

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,800
paste.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Is Anna paint package for those of you who are, you know, familiar

173
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,500
with how these sorts of things work, right?

174
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,000
If I were to cut and paste this, so I cut and paste, you know, a new

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,900
one in here and make a new layer out of it, right?

176
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,100
I can go ahead and and sort of, reposition that layer and you can see

177
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,100
that when I do that, it sort of looks like if I go back and look at

178
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,600
the image.

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Now it's sort of looks like I've extended the grass area out, right?

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
It's like, it's like a brush.

181
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,200
It's like a stamp right that I can use to make things.

182
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,200
Look kind of like an organic texture that goes for a while larger than

183
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,500
the original one was certainly and here, I'll add the other stamp

184
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
As well, right?

185
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,100
So here's that other stamp, I'll put that one over there.

186
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,200
Let's say and and maybe we'll, we'll duplicate this layer again and

187
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,600
I'll put that down here, right?

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And so you can kind of see how like if I just duplicate these things I

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
can kind of make an area.

190
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,400
That's, that's kind of grassy but that isn't necessarily obviously

191
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,100
repeating.

192
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,400
Now, ideally, you're not going to do this with just two brushes like

193
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
this, right?

194
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,400
You know, ideally you're going to use more than just that, right?

195
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
Because you can already, sort of start to see, you'll see some kind of

196
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,700
patterns in it, if you only have two brushes and, and that may be a

197
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,500
little bit too much, but you can kind of see how that's meant to work.

198
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,000
And similarly, like, you know, if I start adding in the other brushes

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,800
here like this,

200
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
Oops, that's not right.

201
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
My gimp skills are, you know already in question here?

202
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,500
All right.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,100
So you know if you add another one here, you can sort of start to see

204
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,600
how maybe you make an area, that's got some some Stone to it, right?

205
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,500
And just from using this technique, you can't necessarily get perfect

206
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:45,800
results.

207
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,800
There's a bunch of things that we'd want to do like we you know, and

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,500
again, using continuing forward on the stamp front, I could start to

209
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,700
even show you sort of a little bit with some of those look like

210
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,200
Right.

211
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,100
I can start stamping in some of these detail things here, right to

212
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,600
cover, like the boundary between them that sort of stuff, right.

213
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,300
Making a few of these little guys here, you know, that kind of come

214
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,400
around and, you know, you can start to imagine building up a world

215
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:11,900
this way.

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,600
And so the, the vision that I have for the vision that I have this is

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,800
sounds like some kind of a Silicon Valley, Ted Talk.

218
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
What I am planning to do

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,300
In terms of requesting stuff art wise is eventually in the full art

220
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,700
pack for handmade hero.

221
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,600
What we'll do you know like what we ship with the actual game is?

222
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,100
We have lots and lots of these kinds of pieces for making ground

223
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,900
escapes, right?

224
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,400
So we could put a bunch of stamps in and make kind of semi organic

225
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,100
feeling things that, you know, are able to look non-repeating.

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,200
But that's still have a reasonably high quality level.

227
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,400
And don't look like a tile map, right?

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,000
A tile map would have very

229
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,600
you know, rigid boundaries and look very repetitive and

230
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,700
You know, rectilinear because that's how it's constructed and this is

231
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,000
a way of loosening up those constraints and making it so that we can

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
have a little more freedom to make things feel a little more or a bit

233
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,000
more organic where you can't see the seams as much.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,700
And you know, if we do it well enough and if the source art plays well

235
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,200
enough with it, you can kind of get to a point where it sort of looks

236
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,900
like someone hand-painted each individual screen instead of it

237
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,000
actually being assembled four pieces right now, you probably can never

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
get all the way there because

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
Cuz you know, a hand-painted thing can have a lot of little touches in

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:32,900
it.

241
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,300
That maybe it's too hard to reproduce with these kinds of techniques

242
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,800
without going overboard.

243
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
But it certainly gets you something that looks a lot more distinctive

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
than a tilemap or stated alternately.

245
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,100
It's something that lets your artists produce higher quality results

246
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,400
in less time than they would have to do if they want to use a tile map

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,600
because you could imagine still doing something of this quality level

248
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,900
with talismans, having tons and tons of tiles and being really

249
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
About how the tiles matchup and stuff like that.

250
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,900
Certainly there are artists who are very good at that but that's a lot

251
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,400
of work.

252
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,100
A lot of mental overhead, a lot of dealing with constraints that's

253
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
just a lot harder for artists to do.

254
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,500
And in some cases, there's things that they just can't do in that way

255
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,600
because it doesn't work out.

256
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Right?

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And without the basically, just painting everything and giving you a

258
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
you know, tile map, that was essentially just a series of tiles that

259
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,800
reconstruct, pre-made backgrounds.

260
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,300
So yeah, so that's basically what I want to do and so we already have

261
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,800
the ability to do alpha Blended Sprites and so although it will

262
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
probably tank our frame rate because we haven't actually written a,

263
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,800
any blink code that works?

264
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Well at all.

265
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
And that's a tall efficient.

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,300
We could still make something that kind of built up some ground this

267
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,600
way, so maybe we should go ahead and play.

268
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Out that a little bit because that's like I said, something that's

269
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,100
kind of light and fun, it doesn't really bring in any anything

270
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,900
particularly new.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's just kind of a setting up some stuff to see how that's going to

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,100
work, and I do want to do that sooner rather than later.

273
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,000
And the reason for that is I would like to see what we want to do in

274
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,200
terms of pulling these into like Sim regions and stuff because I'm

275
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,400
imagining that things like this, we may still want them to go through

276
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
the editing system because

277
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,100
That allows us to use our spatial partition and all that sort of

278
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,300
stuff, but we may not want to bring them to the same region because

279
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,600
they if they're just background, we may not need them to actually do

280
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,000
anything.

281
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,700
Now, some things they want to go into the same region, some things may

282
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,300
not want to go into the same region, right?

283
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Like these little Tufts of grass here, for example, maybe we want them

284
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,900
to go into the same region because as you walk by them they like

285
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,400
flutter a little bit, you know, where there's like you know they react

286
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,900
the breeze or maybe that's handled in like a different way.

287
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,100
And so

288
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,300
These don't go into some reason but they do go into some other list

289
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,500
that, you know, just has artifacts on them that sort of stuff.

290
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,500
And so, you know, we kind of have to have some plan for how that

291
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,500
stuff's going to go.

292
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,900
And so having some

293
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,800
In there now will allow us to make better architectural decisions and

294
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,200
it does make some sense for us to play with it in advance of doing the

295
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,700
rest of the stuff.

296
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,500
So let's go ahead and take a look at that.

297
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,500
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to start by again, just

298
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,600
loading those in nothing, particularly fancy.

299
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,600
What I might do here is say well we have those loaded bitmaps.

300
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,100
I'm going to go ahead and make like to sort of arrays of these stamps

301
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,700
for now.

302
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
something where we're going to do, like a

303
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,700
Grass.

304
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,300
We had to Grass ones.

305
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,100
We had, I think, four stone ones, right?

306
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,400
And, and we had those Tufts, I don't know how many tests we had three.

307
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,000
One, two, three.

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, I think that's right.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,800
Yeah grass.

310
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
Zero grasses are one Ground Zero through 4 and I guess.

311
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,600
So we had we had rocks to we have these little rocks there, right?

312
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,000
Forgot about those, although I don't know that we really need to do

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,900
anything with those.

314
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
So, Okay, so we've got the

315
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,900
I guess, you know, is one of these is any of these like a decorative

316
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,100
rock.

317
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Those are big.

318
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
Yeah, those are all pretty big rocks.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
So I don't know about those.

320
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,100
So let's skip the rocks for now and we'll just use some of those

321
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,500
Tufts, so I want to load these up, right?

322
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,600
And again, we're not dealing with our asset streaming or any of that

323
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,000
stuff yet.

324
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,800
So we don't care about this code at all.

325
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,400
We just want something that will load them in and so we've got that

326
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,300
code already working here, right?

327
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
We've already got ways to load those bitmaps in, so I'm going to go

328
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,900
ahead and just load them in.

329
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,800
Again, just in the stupidest way possible because you don't want to

330
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,600
think about this at all, this is not important.

331
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
This is not code that will be used at all.

332
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,800
We will have some very different way of dealing with with art Assets

333
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
in the future fact.

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,500
That's one of our to-do items so there's those two grasses, a load

335
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,200
those in.

336
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
We've got those Tufts

337
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,700
I'll go ahead and load those in so, you know it if I was smart I'd cut

338
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,000
and paste after I added it to be correct.

339
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,400
So there's this Tufts, right?

340
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:11,500
To and lastly, we have the stones and I'll load those in.

341
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay.

342
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,800
And

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Let's see.

344
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,099
Oops, select paste bug there.

345
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,800
What would update program be without a cut?

346
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,599
Paste bug, though, at the end of the day.

347
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,099
Really?

348
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So let's go ahead and and build that make sure that's all good.

349
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
That seems all good.

350
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,600
And so now I guess what I'd like to do is is let's skip let's let's

351
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
not bring anything unnecessary into the problem right now.

352
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,600
Let's just straightforward, see what we can do with compositing.

353
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,800
So what I'm going to do is I'm literally going to straight up just

354
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,300
draw that compositing right in here underneath before we do anything

355
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:55,900
else, right?

356
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,400
You know, we're going to we come into the draw Loop here.

357
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,800
This was our

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,900
Clear call, right?

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
This clears, the screen to that gray.

360
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
That's behind it now.

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,200
So, what I'm going to do is literally right after that and I'll even

362
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,500
just cut calves it off.

363
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'll basically just say like you know draw test or something like

364
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:14,900
this.

365
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,500
We'll just put it up there because I think we're going to want to kind

366
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,800
of save it as like a thing.

367
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,000
It's like, okay, this is how we sort of, when we were playing around

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,100
with this is kind of what we did.

369
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,500
So we'll do like a draw test ground, right?

370
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
And, and that'll just give us a little function here.

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,300
We can play in and then when you know since tomorrow we'll probably

372
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,300
get back to what we were working on with the Clinton detection, then

373
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,800
we can just turn it, it will just comment it out and it won't, you

374
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,600
know, won't get run.

375
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,800
So I'm going to have this group, this draw test count round function

376
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,600
and the first thing that I want to do is I want to have some way.

377
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,500
Of of looking at how these things composite together.

378
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,900
So I guess I just want to have that sort of that drawbitmap call.

379
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,800
In fact, I don't remember.

380
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,300
Do we have we only have one drawbitmap call yet that has the alpha

381
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,700
with it.

382
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,900
Yeah.

383
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,000
So we just, this is our only called, right?

384
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,800
And that's in screen space.

385
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,100
So those are actually using just straight up stream, core strip,

386
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,700
stream, coordinates screen coordinates.

387
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,500
Wow, so yeah, if we're just going to draw this looks

388
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,200
I also need that game asking buffer, which I did not pass.

389
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,300
I'll have to pass that.

390
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
And then I'm just going to draw a couple of these.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm going to draw the some of them will start, I guess, maybe with the

392
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,300
grasses.

393
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,400
And what I'm going to do is, you know what, maybe we'll just draw them

394
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
at some random locations.

395
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,300
So, we'll just draw a random grasses at random locations for now.

396
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
And we have that random number table, right?

397
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
We were doing this, this thing here.

398
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,100
So I could go ahead and just steal that for now.

399
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,400
And yeah.

400
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,400
And we can go ahead and pull that out later.

401
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,800
You know what might be nice to is to sort of make that random number

402
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Stuff a little more systemic and maybe that's something we'll do too.

403
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
So you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to say that, that's

404
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,600
another thing that we'll probably do today to do Casey.

405
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,700
Make random number generation more systemic right and we might do that

406
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,300
real soon.

407
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,900
That might be something we do just as soon as I get this sort of thing

408
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,100
loaded here and drawing.

409
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,100
All right, so if I want to draw one of these grasses, I'll just screw

410
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,600
up, draw This Grass, I'll draw it at, I don't know, 100 100 for now

411
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,700
because I don't have any better idea of where I want.

412
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,000
Draw it.

413
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,400
And I want to draw it at full Alpha obviously, in fact, I guess I

414
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,900
don't need to include

415
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,400
Because I'm going to draw it full Alpha.

416
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,100
So, let me take a look here.

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,200
Draw test, ground is not take tips true.

418
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
Let's go ahead and pass that screen buffer.

419
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,700
What is this?

420
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,600
Ah, and we need to that loaded bitmap has the width and the height but

421
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,800
we

422
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Specifically get the pixels out of it.

423
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,300
I believe.

424
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,000
Is that true?

425
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,200
I don't know if that's true.

426
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,700
Let's draw a bitmap dude.

427
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,200
Just drawbitmap take it takes a loaded bitmap.

428
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh I just need to pass a pointer so that's all good.

429
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,900
So I think that should give us something where we actually do, see

430
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
that grass show up, and there it is right now, like I said, it's

431
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,900
always just drawing it in screen space, it's so when I move it just

432
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,000
going to move with the camera.

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,800
So it's gonna be the same

434
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,400
Place on the screen because we're not even thinking about how they're

435
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
getting pulled into the world or where they are yet, that's not even

436
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
on the table, right?

437
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,700
So now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to try just splatting down a

438
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,600
ton of those, and I want to see what that looks like, if I splat down

439
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,100
ton of them.

440
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,500
So, let's go ahead and take the random number generator here.

441
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,700
And when I say, random number generator, I mean not really generator

442
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,100
because all we did was use a random number table at the moment.

443
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,600
Random number generation is sort of on our to-do list of stuff to

444
00:21:59,600 --> 00:21:59,900
talk.

445
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,200
About how you do it and to implement one.

446
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
So right now we're just using a table of random numbers.

447
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,400
So yeah, so I can go ahead and do this and grab one.

448
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,600
Out of there.

449
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,800
And I'm just going to say that, you know, we'll just we're in pixel

450
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,500
space right now which again is not particularly useful.

451
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,300
In fact, I guess, one thing.

452
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,700
Maybe we want to actually make this not be in pixel space so we'll use

453
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,200
that m 2 pixels for example.

454
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,300
So will actually make this this number B and M so we'll do like x m

455
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,000
And why M?

456
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,400
Or I could even do, let's see p just a position for the grass here,

457
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,200
right.

458
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,400
And so when I initialize this, what I'm going to do is I'm going to

459
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,100
try to initialize this, to a value that is going to be within reason,

460
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,900
right?

461
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I want to pick random points on the screen to draw this grass and I

462
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,900
need to come up with numbers.

463
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,900
If we're doing our mirrors to pixel thing, you know, I want to come up

464
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,700
with numbers between like -

465
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,400
M, + 16 meters or something, right?

466
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Or negative 20 meters in plus 20 or something like that, right?

467
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,100
But our random number generator, right?

468
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Whatever the random number generator is is only going to produce

469
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,000
values within a certain range, right?

470
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,700
Because it's just, you know, no matter what we end up doing there,

471
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,800
we're always just going to have some random entropy that it produces.

472
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,900
And of course we do have a little bit of a problem here which is we

473
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,600
don't actually know what the range of these random numbers are we just

474
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
grab them off of random.org right there.

475
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Just some random numbers that we got.

476
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,300
I don't even remember what their maximum value is.

477
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,800
But you can see just looking at these right, that there is no, the

478
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,900
high bit is never set in these, right?

479
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,200
So basically, like it's not the full 32-bit range of unsigned

480
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,700
integers.

481
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,400
All.

482
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,900
And in fact, I guess I could look here 0, x 7, 6 5.

483
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:12,000
So it looks like it looks like we never have any values that are going

484
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,600
to be higher than, you know.

485
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,900
Oh, X500, yeah.

486
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,600
It's in fact, they don't even use the first hex digit.

487
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Right.

488
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,800
So there there somewhere, I don't know.

489
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,200
Can eat.

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
Can emacs's quick calc do this.

491
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,800
What is like one of these numbers in

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,900
In decimal.

493
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,500
Oh, it can't do that.

494
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,300
Oh well too bad.

495
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,300
I was hoping that quick calc might save the day there but it didn't.

496
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,000
But anyway point being yeah, these are relatively small.

497
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,100
So what we don't actually know is we don't know what the maximum value

498
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,900
of our random number table is but you know what?

499
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,400
That's not a particularly hard thing to figure out.

500
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,100
So I'm going to go ahead and figure out what the maximum number is in

501
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,500
there.

502
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm just going to go ahead and say all right we've got a max value,

503
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,900
the max value is assumed to be zero at the

504
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,300
Set, which is, of course, the smallest value that you can actually

505
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,800
have.

506
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,300
I'm going to say that I've got a number index and that, that runs the

507
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,800
whole length of the random number table, right?

508
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,800
And then I'm just going to say that if, you know, for any given entry

509
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,200
in the table, whatever that happens to be, I'm going to say that if

510
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,900
the thing that I've got is less than that, then I'm going to keep it

511
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,300
right like so.

512
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,900
And so you know, if I go in and

513
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
And and actually run that code.

514
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Now that'll tell me what the largest value is in my random number

515
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:37,800
table.

516
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,500
And thus, what the largest number is that it could possibly produce.

517
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,600
So let's go ahead and grab that break point here.

518
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,300
Hello draw test bitmap, there it is.

519
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,900
Let's go ahead and run through that and see what the max value is.

520
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,300
So there's that max value.

521
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,800
So I'm just going to take that max value and I'm going to put that

522
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,500
into our random number generator, right?

523
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,600
As a thing.

524
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,100
Thing that we know.

525
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,000
So if I go in here to the random number thing, I'm going to say you

526
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,500
know maximum random number.

527
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,100
Is that right?

528
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,400
You know Max random number.

529
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,900
I'm not a big fan of the all caps.

530
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,500
Why do you have to shout all the time?

531
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,800
So anyway

532
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,200
That's the maximum value that can be produced.

533
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,900
So, what we know then is, if I want to produce, write a floating Point

534
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,000
number, if I want to produce a float, and what I'm getting back as

535
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,600
these random, you went 32s, right?

536
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,300
That I know range from zero potentially, although I don't actually see

537
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,100
Zero there either.

538
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,400
I wonder what the minimum value actually is, I probably should have

539
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
done that too, huh?

540
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Let's take a look.

541
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,700
You and 32 Min value equals Max random

542
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,100
Brr, right?

543
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,700
Or I guess I could even do this.

544
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,000
I wanted to be clever.

545
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I said it to the maximum of the minimum.

546
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,800
I set the minimum.

547
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,900
To be the maximum.

548
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,700
It could possibly be so that anything that I hid in, the loop will be

549
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
less than it.

550
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,600
Which and then I'll just always take, whichever the less least value

551
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,600
is, I'll keep them to lose.

552
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,000
This is, by the way, a very common programming programming pattern, if

553
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
you have, never seen it before.

554
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,500
If you want to, just keep track of a minimum or maximum value, while

555
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,900
you're processing things, you just set an initial value.

556
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,300
That's the smallest thing or this, or the largest thing that the that

557
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,500
it could possibly be.

558
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,400
And that way when you go through, no matter what the entries are in

559
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,300
your actual set of values are comparing, you'll always pick out the

560
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,600
smallest and the largest of them, right?

561
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,900
So let's go ahead and run that and we'll see what the minimum value is

562
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,400
as well.

563
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Let's go ahead and run that.

564
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,700
Oops, that probably would have worked.

565
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,600
I guess because our reload would have would have caught that but just

566
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,800
- well recompile it.

567
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,300
So that's the smallest value that there is as well right there.

568
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Okay.

569
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,500
So those are, those are our

570
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,800
Hence we could just treat that one.

571
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,500
Small enough that we could just treat that one as 0 but you know we

572
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,700
computed it, you might as well leave it in here.

573
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,600
So there you go.

574
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,300
So that's our range.

575
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say all right,

576
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Let's assume that that we get back, one of these random integers.

577
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,000
And we know that at maximum, it's going to be, you know, this value

578
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,500
right here.

579
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So if I want to produce a floating-point number, what I can do is I

580
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,700
can take whatever the value is that I would get back, right?

581
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,900
I can take that random number table entry and I can divide it by

582
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,700
whatever the maximum is, right?

583
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,700
So if I, if I, you know, move that up to a float and then I divide it

584
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,100
by whatever the maximum

585
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,400
You could have been, I'll get a number between 0 and 1.

586
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,100
That is how big it was within the range of the values that we get

587
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,500
back.

588
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,000
Right?

589
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,800
So that's a pretty easy way to turn random 32-bit integers into random

590
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
floating Point values.

591
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,300
It's very common right?

592
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,600
Nothing particularly fancy going on there and that's one way that I

593
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,900
could create a random point.

594
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,200
So that means now after I have that random Point, I've got a number

595
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,300
between 0 1, unfortunately,

596
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,400
I actually want, you know, if we assume that the center of the screen

597
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,900
100, for example, which is how we've been rendering stuff so far,

598
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,400
If I assume that the cameras pointed at 0 0.

599
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,400
And so what I really want to do is if I'm trying to you know put grass

600
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,800
around a central point or something.

601
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,400
I would want a number between negative 1 and 1 for example so that I

602
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,100
could multiply by some radius that I want to put things around based

603
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,000
on the point.

604
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,000
And so if I want to do that, I need to figure out a way to turn a

605
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,500
number between 0 and 1 into a number between negative 1 and 1, right?

606
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,200
And so that's again, pretty easy.

607
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,800
That's just scaling up the

608
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
Range and moving it, right?

609
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,400
And so the way that you typically think about these things again, it's

610
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,800
second nature for

611
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
When he's been programming for a while, but if it's not the sort of

612
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,700
thing that you do, you might not be familiar with it.

613
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,500
So I'll just, I'll just draw it out quickly for people so they can

614
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,000
see.

615
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,300
So, there's day 81, right there.

616
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,100
And so what we're doing here is we're saying

617
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,400
Okay, we have a number that's mapped between 0 and 1 so it's in here,

618
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,500
right?

619
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,600
And here is my my number line.

620
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,200
And what I want to do is I want to take that and I want to transform

621
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,400
it so that instead of being between 0 and 1, it's between negative 1

622
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,300
and 1, right?

623
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,700
So it actually occupies this range

624
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,400
Yeah, so there's a couple ways, right?

625
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
You can think about doing this, the intuitive way that you just do

626
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,500
after you've been programming for a while as you go, okay.

627
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,900
This range is twice as large right.

628
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,100
How do I know it's twice as large?

629
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,500
Well the maximum minus the minimum right is 1 minus negative 1 that's

630
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,400
the range.

631
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,900
You know it goes from negative 1 to 1 which of course equals one plus

632
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,000
one or two.

633
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
So the range is too.

634
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,000
In this case the range was 1, 1 minus 0 is 1, right?

635
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,400
So I know that it's twice as wide that interval.

636
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,700
So the first thing I'm going to do is multiply it by 2 to get it so

637
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,200
that the range goes from 0 to 2.

638
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,500
So now it's big enough, right?

639
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,100
So I'm going to multiply by 2, then when you to do is just shift it

640
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,300
down so that it lines up with the original part, right?

641
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,100
And so, what I want to do is say, okay, we need to move it down one,

642
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,900
so I need to subtract one from it in order to line it up and then I'm

643
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,500
done, right?

644
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,400
And so you just intuitively would do that in your head.

645
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,500
And if you're in programming for a while, you're just like, oh, okay.

646
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,700
I've got some function that produces a number that's between zero and

647
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,800
one, right?

648
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,900
And so if I wanted to make it between negative one and one, I just do

649
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:01,100
two of it - one and that now equals a range of - oops of negative 1 to

650
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
1, right?

651
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,700
So, I mean, I can't really say, I don't know why these are the sorts

652
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
of things that programmers, just end up doing in their head.

653
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,000
I think it's because you do him.

654
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,400
So often, you just end up.

655
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:11,700
Yep.

656
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,300
That's that's the way my brain just automatically does it.

657
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,500
So I don't really sit down and work out the math for doing things like

658
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,100
that, because you've done it so many times that you're just used to

659
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,900
it, right?

660
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,800
And so you could if you're doing things like this and they're a little

661
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,700
too complicated for you.

662
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,800
Like maybe not this one, but something that's slightly more

663
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,600
complicated.

664
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,100
You can choose to work out the math, a little more explicitly, right?

665
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,400
You could say, you know, something that would give you.

666
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,800
I would give you some indication of what it was going to be.

667
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,900
Like you could say like you know, I have an f of x and I want it to

668
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,200
map to this negative one to one thing.

669
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,900
Right?

670
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,500
And you could say like all right, what I know is I want F of 0 to map

671
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,800
to -1 and I want f

672
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Of 12 map-21, right?

673
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,100
So here I'm saying I'm saying I've got this interval 0 to 1 and I want

674
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,400
it to map that way, I know, to example values, right?

675
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,200
That of what it is that I'm that I'm inputting into this function,

676
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,000
right?

677
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,500
And so over here, whereas I did it sort of like where I was I just

678
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,200
kind of read it off and did it by rote.

679
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,100
I end up with an equation that essentially is just 2x minus 1,

680
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
whatever that input function was right?

681
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,400
So we'll call that thing X because I wrote it as f of x but really, I

682
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,800
don't even know why I bother doing that.

683
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
It's not really an f of x.

684
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,300
It's just the random number 0 to 1 range, that comes back.

685
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,700
So we ended up with a thing that was 2x minus 1, right?

686
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,400
That was the actual equation that we were going to use and that's the

687
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,100
Thing that we would type in right here.

688
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:00,500
But if we didn't know what that was once we have this, we do have to

689
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,500
essentially points defined on whatever our function is.

690
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:12,300
And so if we wanted to we could make up an equation and and see what

691
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,500
we solve for.

692
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,699
We could we could sort of see what it tells us the result is and it

693
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,300
sounds a little weird, but I'll show you what I mean.

694
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,699
mean, so, all we have to decide is what what type of curve

695
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,600
We want, right?

696
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,600
Right, like, what type of curve do we want this thing to take?

697
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Because we've set to sample points.

698
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,600
So we could use those two sample points to figure out what the results

699
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,300
of what the resulting function that we want actually is, but we

700
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,300
haven't said is what happens in between, so we've said, two points is

701
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,699
what it is, but what happens in between.

702
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,400
So all right, you told me that when I input zero, I want it to come

703
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,199
out as negative 1.

704
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,900
When I am put one on to come out as one.

705
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,200
But what happens in between is it, you know, a

706
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,500
Is it just a linear progression between those two?

707
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Is it a parabola, right?

708
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,700
Does it get like, is it slow and then fast and then slow, right?

709
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,500
And you can imagine if I drew the graph here where I said, all right,

710
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,700
I've got that and just to be a little more explicit.

711
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,100
I'm sorry, I'm not, I feel like I'm not really communicating as well

712
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:21,200
as I'd like to just to be explicit when I say f of x.

713
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
So I know math can be daunting right when I say f of x.

714
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
What I'm talking about here,

715
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,300
Is the function we wanted to find, right?

716
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,200
And I feel like the reason I confusing is because I was using f of x

717
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,500
up here.

718
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,200
So, let me just recap clarify, just to be absolutely cementing it,

719
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,300
right?

720
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,000
So if f of x is the function we want to find, right?

721
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,500
This is the function to find.

722
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,300
The X in here.

723
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,200
The thing that I'm plugging in is that output from the thing we

724
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,100
already have.

725
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,300
So we have a number between 0 and 1 and we want it to go between

726
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,000
negative 1 and 1, right.

727
00:35:59,600 --> 00:35:59,800
And

728
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,100
X.

729
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,600
Is that zero to one number that we're trying to transform that that f

730
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,000
is transforming into the thing that we actually want.

731
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,900
You know, that goes from negative 1 to 1, right?

732
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,300
And so if you take a look at here, you know if we were to plug in X so

733
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,900
X goes from 0 to 1.

734
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,400
That's what we're saying and we were to look at what happens to f of

735
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,900
x, right?

736
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,200
Where this is let's say.

737
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,500
To do.

738
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,000
So this is one, this is like .5, and this is negative 0.5.

739
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,300
And this is negative 1, right?

740
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,500
So we're looking at what's going to happen to this this function that

741
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:47,200
we want what I'm saying here is well, okay, we've defined what happens

742
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,300
at x equals 0.

743
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,200
We want it to be here, and we've defined what happens at x equals 1.

744
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,400
We want it to be here.

745
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,200
But now, what we need to tell math in order for math to help us is

746
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,500
what happens in between.

747
00:36:59,500 --> 00:36:59,800
Does it look

748
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Like this, does it look like that?

749
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Does it look like this?

750
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,100
Right?

751
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,400
You know, what is the shape of that thing because math could produce

752
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,800
all sorts of things that could produce a thing that looked like this,

753
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,500
for all we know?

754
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,100
Right?

755
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,800
So we need to give it a little more information and the way we give it

756
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,600
that information.

757
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,100
Like, what determines that is?

758
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,900
What does the function look like and specifically, what is the degree,

759
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,600
right?

760
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,600
The degree of the polynomial.

761
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,700
And if you remember from your math classes, which

762
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,300
Really, you've had at some point back in grade school, whatever your

763
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,000
algebra class was degrees of polynomial is, like, if I have a function

764
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,900
in X, then the degree is like, what's the highest power?

765
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,500
So, you know, if I've got an x to the fifth plus x, to the fourth plus

766
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,100
x, to the third plus x, to the squared plus X, plus a constant, and

767
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,300
that's my function of X, right?

768
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,100
Then, I would say that this was degree five, it's a fifth order.

769
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,700
We often say, right?

770
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,000
It's a fifth order, polynomial.

771
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,100
And so what this determines, what that order is, that determines how

772
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,900
complex the curve is between those two points, right?

773
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,200
When that I'm asking for, if I say that I only have a first-order

774
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,600
thing, I've got X plus C equals f of x.

775
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,200
Then I've got just a line that goes between them, right?

776
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
But if I was to say x squared,

777
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Plus X plus C.

778
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,500
Now, I've got a parabola that goes between them, right?

779
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,000
So it could have like this kind of shape, right?

780
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,900
So hopefully that all makes reasonable sense.

781
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,600
That's sort of what we're talking about here.

782
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,700
So, in this case, I don't want any kind of complicated curve mapping

783
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,500
between my things.

784
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,600
I just want to linearly take 0 to 1 and map it to negative 1 to 1.

785
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,200
So it should be, you know, it should be a perfect.

786
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,300
Linear mapping between those two so that as I slide x from 0 to 1

787
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,400
smoothly, it slides from

788
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,900
- 121 smoothly at a constant speed.

789
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,700
To where we are in that space, right?

790
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,300
And so what that means is that I'm looking, I don't want any of these

791
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,000
higher orders in here, it means I'm looking at something that looks

792
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,600
like this.

793
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,100
And so what I do is, I set up an equation.

794
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,300
That's the most General equation, for, you know, a function of that

795
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,800
kind and I just go ahead and solve it, right?

796
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,700
I said these are my two points that I've defined.

797
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:29,600
So now, I know my f of x looks like some

798
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,400
Efficient times X plus some, you know, constant that's the simplest

799
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:35,600
form.

800
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,900
I don't know what these two are.

801
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
I have no idea, right?

802
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm just gonna let math figure it out.

803
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:45,600
So I plug in my to sample points, I say that F of 0, right?

804
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,100
So f of x, that's going to equal

805
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,500
A time, 0/2 there, plus b.

806
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,900
And I said that, if I plug in 0, I want negative 1.

807
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,200
So that's going to equal negative 1.

808
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,700
Well, that means b equals negative 1, right?

809
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,500
I mean, zero times a is 0 so that means b equals a good one.

810
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,200
Boom, I've solved my first unknown that I had and similarly, I can now

811
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,400
plug in my second sample point, right.

812
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,000
I can say F of 1 is going to

813
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,500
Equal to a 1, right?

814
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,100
Because I plug in for x and then I already know what B is.

815
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,100
I know that b is negative 1 and that's going to equal 1, right?

816
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,900
And so if I have F of 1 equals a minus one, equals one,

817
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,200
that means a equals to write because I move the the one over the other

818
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,400
side and it lo and behold, I plug those two things in, I get f of x

819
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,800
equals ax plus b or 2x minus 1.

820
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,700
And hey, that's exactly the thing that I did in my head in a totally

821
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,400
different way but that's the function we're looking for.

822
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,000
So again, you know, like I said, kind of wanted to be like the stream

823
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,900
so you know, I want didn't want to do anything, we're going to be

824
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,000
getting too deep into the code so I figured I'd just go off on a

825
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,100
standing here and show you

826
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,100
How simple that stuff actually is.

827
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,600
Basically, you could do this for any kind of curve that you wanted if

828
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
you know, in a sample points and obviously you need more sample points

829
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,200
as you get higher up in degree.

830
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,100
Because for example, there's there's this notion right of degrees of

831
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,700
freedom

832
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,100
You could sort of think of them as where the more power you have in

833
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,100
your function, the more, you know, you got x x squared x cubed x,

834
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,800
right?

835
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,200
The further, you go up the higher that degree of polynomial, the more

836
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,700
degrees of freedom, it could be thought to have meaning, the more

837
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,700
constraints it can hit on here.

838
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:55,100
If I have an equation in X, well, it can hit two points but that's the

839
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,600
most, it could have hit because remember the equation got completely.

840
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,900
Determined just by.

841
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Plugging in these two points completely determined, there was no more

842
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,100
degrees of freedom left in there.

843
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
There was no more slack, the equation was what it was.

844
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,100
So if I had said a third thing, if I'd said, f of 2 is 12, Well, we'd

845
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,200
be out of luck because either that's already redundant.

846
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,200
Meaning when you plug in F of 2, you do get 12 out of this.

847
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,100
But hey guess what?

848
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,300
2 times 2 is 4.

849
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
Minus 1 is 3.

850
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,100
You don't write or the true you know you're in a situation like that

851
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,800
where it doesn't

852
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,600
Equal it.

853
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,000
And then this is not possible to satisfy, so either, it's not possible

854
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,300
satisfy or it's redundant.

855
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,000
And that opens up whole cans of worms.

856
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,800
You can solve redundant systems and you can also solve

857
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,300
over constraint systems.

858
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,200
That's like, when you get into things like, you know, least squares

859
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,500
and singular value decomposition, and all these sort of cool way out

860
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,300
of scope for tonight, linear algebra things.

861
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,600
But when you're just dealing with the basics, what you want to

862
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,000
basically thinking about is just how many degrees of freedom you have.

863
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,500
And so, if you have a equation in X, you've got those two degrees of

864
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,400
freedom you can hit.

865
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,200
And if you went up further, like let's say, I went up to squared, I'd

866
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,400
be adding another point.

867
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,500
I

868
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Hit right?

869
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,200
So if I went up and I said that I was going to do f of x equals, write

870
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,000
ax squared, plus BX, plus C.

871
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,100
So now it's a parabola right now, it's a thing that's going to look

872
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,600
like this or whatever like that or who knows what depends on the signs

873
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,300
of these things.

874
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,200
Then now, I know in addition to having these two points, I could hit

875
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,600
one more point, right?

876
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,300
I can pick one more point to hit and it would solve for the parabola

877
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,900
that curves just so right so that it could hit them.

878
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,800
And, you know, by the way, that thing I was saying about redundant or

879
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,600
or impossible.

880
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,400
If you looked at it on the graph, a redundant point for a third point,

881
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,000
you know, for if we were back at the f of x equals ax plus b, right,

882
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
that can solve this line that can draw a line between those two

883
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
points, redundant would be if I gave it a third point to hit that was

884
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,200
happen to be right on the line right now.

885
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,400
It can do it but if that point is off the line, yes, I could hit that

886
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,500
with the parabola version.

887
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,400
The simpler version, its it can't.

888
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,000
No way.

889
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,900
It can draw one line that goes through three points, right?

890
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,500
And so with the other linear, algebra techniques and stuff do to, to

891
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,100
work this out, is other techniques.

892
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,800
What they do is they allow you to specify other things you can do to

893
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,700
still solve it.

894
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,900
So like maybe you say, well, alright, I realized that there's no such

895
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,900
thing as a line that passes through three points.

896
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,200
But what I do want you to do, is, give me the line that passes the

897
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,000
closest total to those three points using some metrics.

898
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,500
So, the, I want you

899
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,900
To minimize the total distance between the line and the points or

900
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,000
something like that, right?

901
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,100
That would be an example of what math could do by elevating up to hire

902
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,500
more.

903
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,500
Math.

904
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,500
You can still you can still solve even though there's no way to do the

905
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,600
actual physical and you can still get Solutions out of these by saying

906
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,600
I'm willing to give a little bit up and the math will go.

907
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,900
Okay well will you tell me what you're willing to give up?

908
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,100
And I'll tell you what the best answer is and so that can still be

909
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,200
very powerful, right?

910
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,500
Alright, so that was a nice long digression.

911
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,100
I feel good about that, that kind of cleared, the pallet kind of kind

912
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,800
of, got me got me out of the train running over people's mood that we

913
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
were in when we started.

914
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,700
And so, what I want to do here is just just I'll throw that in there.

915
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,000
So that's what we said.

916
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,700
That was two times the input, right?

917
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:39,600
Which is this stuff laughs, I guess.

918
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
I don't even need to print size that, right?

919
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,700
It's two times that input minus 1.

920
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
That's what we solve for it.

921
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Hopefully, we did the math, right?

922
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Didn't make a mistake.

923
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,600
So that's the the input.

924
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:55,800
We want to basically do this some number of times, right?

925
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
I'm going to start with just one Rask index.

926
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,600
I'm going to start with one so we can make sure it worked, but then

927
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,900
we'll Crank that number up.

928
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,200
And then what we need to do is we need to transfer form that into

929
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,300
something that centered around the origin of the center of the screen

930
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,400
because it would start there.

931
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,600
And, and that's it gets the m 2 pixels in it.

932
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
So we want to do

933
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:22,000
This, we might call this actually, the offset not p, and we might say

934
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,200
that we had a center of the screen, right?

935
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,400
In the center of, the screen would be that buffer, width buffer

936
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,700
height, we've got in there.

937
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,300
I would have not hyped him.

938
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,300
So if we take half of those, that would be the center of the screen.

939
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,800
And then we can go ahead and just say, alright, we've got the point

940
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
for our grass is the center of the screen.

941
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,000
Plus the offset.

942
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,800
I scaled by that m 2 pixels, right?

943
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,300
And when we go ahead and draw that, we need to know the location of

944
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:56,500
it.

945
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,700
And so I'm going to go ahead and grab that location out right here.

946
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,000
And that should give us a grass at a random location, Right theory.

947
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,600
And there it is.

948
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,400
Hopefully, that's a reasonable random location.

949
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:08,900
We don't know.

950
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,400
And if we were to go ahead again and increase that number, so let's

951
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,600
say I increase this number to 10, we should see more grass show up

952
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:17,900
there.

953
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,000
Does it looks like we're not?

954
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:25,500
Oh right, we forgot to say how many meters we wanted our radius to be

955
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,000
right.

956
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,700
So this is a radius of 1 meter so they're going to be all kind of

957
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,400
clustered.

958
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,100
But what that does tell me is is that really oh, and also we're using

959
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,000
the center of the screen.

960
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,400
Which is we've got a couple more things to work out recently Center

961
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,400
the screen, which is we probably want the center of this like World

962
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,300
drawing here.

963
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,300
No, that's not true.

964
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,300
That's not true.

965
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,700
We are using the center of the World, Part were drawing.

966
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,700
So we're clustered around here and so that seems a little bit off.

967
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,500
But you know what?

968
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,800
We're also not accounting.

969
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,000
We're not, we don't have the center point of the bitmap.

970
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,800
So that's the other thing that we should probably do.

971
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You is account for that center of the bitmap, right?

972
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,000
So let's do that as well.

973
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,400
So we have the bitmap center-right that's going to be equal to

974
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,500
whatever this this this grasp, it map is here, right?

975
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,100
So I've got grass 0, what were these called width?

976
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:27,700
So I've got the width there and the height thing, State grass height.

977
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,100
So we'll grab that bitmap Center and what we want to do now again is

978
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,800
displace out of the bitmap center.

979
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,700
Now, I don't know if we added that to the drawbitmap call.

980
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,900
I don't think that we did, did we?

981
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,300
No, we did not.

982
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,600
So we don't have an offset baked in there as far as I can tell.

983
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,100
So we're going to have to that ourselves.

984
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,200
So it's Center

985
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,800
That's the location that we're actually drawing it.

986
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,100
And then when we actually draw this here, we want to go ahead and just

987
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,300
place it for that bitmap Center.

988
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,700
So that we're drawing about the center of it now, right?

989
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,500
And so now I feel like that should be more centered.

990
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,000
I feel like it probably is although it's hard to really say this is

991
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,600
kind of an eyeball sort of thing.

992
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,900
Looks like it might be a little low.

993
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,300
I wonder if I had a bug in there.

994
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,900
Oh yes I used grass, one height.

995
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,200
That was a little bit of a typo there apologized so that looks more

996
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:16,800
centered.

997
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,200
So now I think we're closer there.

998
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,900
And now we just need that radius.

999
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,400
How big do we want to Splat?

1000
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,600
How big of a thing about these?

1001
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,900
And let's say 10 meters, I don't know how big that is.

1002
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,400
We'll just say that.

1003
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,000
That's a good amount there.

1004
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,100
And so we just multiply that Offset, you know, that random offset by

1005
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,400
thing.

1006
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,300
And now again, these are going to be a circle because we're generating

1007
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,800
random numbers inside a square.

1008
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,200
So if we wanted to do a circular stamp down, we have to do some extra

1009
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,500
work.

1010
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,000
So right now we're doing a square stamp and so there we go.

1011
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,300
There's our grasses, stamped.

1012
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,400
And I don't know how far we can push this before our sort of bitmap

1013
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,500
routine rolls over and dies.

1014
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,700
I don't know if you can see that but we kind of at the framerate kind

1015
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,600
of chunks when you get enough of those in there.

1016
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,000
And again that's because we don't have any optimized drawing routines

1017
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,100
of any kind there, but there you go.

1018
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,500
You know, they're starting to look okay, they're they're getting stamp

1019
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,300
down the way that we wanted them to be and so that's fine, right?

1020
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,900
And we can keep on cranking that number up into just making it super

1021
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,600
slow but you know, for our for our purposes, we don't care.

1022
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,700
Look at how slow that is.

1023
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,300
Check that out.

1024
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:18,800
Out.

1025
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,200
Oh the pain.

1026
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,200
It'll be fun to write the renderer and start to tackle some of these

1027
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,700
problems, but there you go, you know, that's what that looks like.

1028
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,400
And so you can sort of you start to see this starts to create a grass

1029
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,400
texture, even just from one and you can see.

1030
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,500
So you can see kind of how that technique can be effective.

1031
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,500
And again, when you look at this, the problem that you see is you see

1032
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,300
those obvious patterns in it and that's why you kind of need there to

1033
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,200
be more variability in the stamps that you're stamping down.

1034
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,800
So you don't get that problem.

1035
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:48,900
Right.

1036
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,700
All right, so we've got some some random points.

1037
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,400
Let's let's just make the radius of its smaller and the number smaller

1038
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,200
so that we can still we can just see kind of what it looks like on

1039
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,900
there and

1040
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,400
There's our little grass patch.

1041
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,400
And off we go.

1042
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,500
So that's all good.

1043
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,300
And so you know we've only got about five minutes left.

1044
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,800
So maybe what I'd like to do now is just kind of clean a little bit

1045
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,200
of, just make a couple little tweaks here to it.

1046
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,000
And then maybe we'll play a little bit more with it tomorrow because

1047
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,100
we just kind of got it working.

1048
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,700
And what I wanted to say was, you'll notice there's a pattern that you

1049
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,500
see kind of creeping in here, which looks like this sort of thing

1050
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,200
where we're doing, you know, in fact, we did this twice

1051
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,400
We had a coefficient and then we had two integers that we were kind of

1052
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
lofting up there.

1053
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,200
What I like to do oftentimes because I like to provide a Constructor

1054
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,800
and again, I'm sorry when I use these terms, I sometimes I try to

1055
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,500
correct myself so I don't actually use terms.

1056
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,100
That means something very specific in other languages in like if

1057
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,900
you're actually doing social room, I don't even Constructor a this is

1058
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,800
just a function that returns a value but it's the thing that we use to

1059
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,500
make Vector twos, right?

1060
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,800
So whatever you want to call that.

1061
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,400
I'd like to make one that makes a vector2 out of integers.

1062
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:14,900
So if you pass it, you know like an in 32 X and Y or a Unit 32 X and A

1063
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:20,200
Y and maybe, you know, you can even do, do something like this where

1064
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,100
you can kind of say like, all right, give me integers.

1065
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,000
And I'll do the cast automatically to make that V-22, locked it up for

1066
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,300
you.

1067
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,500
And so, you know, it's just this kind of

1068
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,300
And the thing that cuts down on a little bit of that redundant typing,

1069
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,500
which, you know, is something you want to do.

1070
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,400
If you can, you don't want to be sitting around.

1071
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,500
We don't get paid by the number of lines of code that we write

1072
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,200
unfortunately.

1073
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,400
So we can't just rejoice in our cutting and pasting.

1074
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,900
So you know, that's just a, that's a pretty easy way to do that.

1075
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,900
I don't know if we can just do this.

1076
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,200
We may get into some hot water with sees casting rules.

1077
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,600
We do that?

1078
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,900
We'll try it first.

1079
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
We'll see what happens.

1080
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,600
But basically, the reason that I like to do stuff like that is because

1081
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,400
then, you know, that,

1082
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,900
Line becomes this line, which is a lot clearer, right?

1083
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,200
That just looks a little bit easier to deal with right.

1084
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,600
And so again we can do that here as well.

1085
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,900
And that's just that's just like a little convenience that I find

1086
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:15,900
that.

1087
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,700
It's nice to have, right?

1088
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,600
So that's good.

1089
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,400
The other thing we might want to do just for fun.

1090
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,300
I mean, there's no sense not doing it, just at the very end here.

1091
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,700
We've got about two minutes left.

1092
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:30,000
Let's go ahead and make that loaded bitmap sort of a parameterised

1093
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
thing, so we'll call that stamp right?

1094
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,800
And and will say that we're going to, we're going to grab the the

1095
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,800
grass out there.

1096
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:42,200
That's whatever the random number table thing gives us back, but it's

1097
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,200
whatever the random number table gives us back mod to, right?

1098
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,200
So we're just going to grab, you know, remember how we do this?

1099
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,000
For putting putting out integers, we get a random number.

1100
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,400
And then we we just say we only want, whatever it is, whatever the

1101
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,200
remainder is after we divide it by the max number we want.

1102
00:53:59,300 --> 00:53:59,900
So we're going to

1103
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,500
Zero.

1104
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:05,100
We're going to add one and we're going to get back one of those loaded

1105
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,100
bitmaps and then we can sort of say okay well you know will stamp

1106
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,300
down?

1107
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:12,200
Whichever random bitmap we picked, right?

1108
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,500
It doesn't matter what it was.

1109
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,400
That's what we're going to do and then we pass that to the function.

1110
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,500
So now we've got something that's drawing both of them and you know

1111
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,500
that kind of scales up nicely so that we can have a bunch of different

1112
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,800
graphs stamps and they would all work.

1113
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,800
Now we could also do

1114
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,900
do something where we pick Stone stamps, right?

1115
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,100
Equivalently we could say if random number table, random number and X

1116
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:39,500
plus.

1117
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,300
There we go, we could say that we want to do that.

1118
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,600
We're depending on what's random number.

1119
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,100
We did again doing the mod 2, so it picks one of the other will either

1120
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:57,300
grab a stone, you know, or will grab a grass and I can do this.

1121
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,800
I can make this a little more systemic to buy sort of saying.

1122
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,300
All right, let's get that array.

1123
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,100
Count of whatever the thing is that, we were picking in there too.

1124
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,200
Right?

1125
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:12,200
And that, that gives us, or should give us both the grass in the

1126
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,300
center of the, what did I do?

1127
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,000
It didn't do that.

1128
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,200
Right.

1129
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,400
If random number table, mod to get the grass.

1130
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,600
Why am I not seeing any stone in there?

1131
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,000
I'm not seeing any stone.

1132
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,900
Did I make a foes?

1133
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,100
Foes Pas.

1134
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,700
We grab out the stamp.

1135
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,200
We draw it.

1136
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,900
What did I do?

1137
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,000
And we mod by the number, but we never see.

1138
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,200
So I'm just gonna go ahead and say,

1139
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,500
say that equals Stone quickly just to make sure we've we did do our

1140
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,600
Stone stuff properly.

1141
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,400
Did we not?

1142
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
We did not huh?

1143
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,700
So do I have a typo down in the stone loader?

1144
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,000
Maybe.

1145
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,400
I don't know.

1146
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,500
Where is that?

1147
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:06,700
Where is that code?

1148
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,400
There is our Stone loader.

1149
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,100
We loaded up those stones.

1150
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,400
So what did I do wrong?

1151
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,300
You guys already know.

1152
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,100
I assume it's been a slow day.

1153
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,900
Oh well that would do it.

1154
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,300
It ain't called Stone people called Ground.

1155
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:31,000
So we just loaded nothing and we didn't crash because I guess when we

1156
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,200
when we load nothing we just stuff a little bit map in there.

1157
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,100
I guess I can't remember what we decide to do for that.

1158
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,300
All right.

1159
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,900
Well, that's how that goes sometimes.

1160
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,500
But hopefully now we've got a mixture of grass and stone.

1161
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,200
I still don't see any stone.

1162
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,100
What is the deal people?

1163
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,100
Round.

1164
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,500
I'm gonna finish this up before we go to the Q&A Ground Zero Zero.

1165
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,700
Ground.

1166
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,100
It is called that, is it?

1167
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,600
Not Ground Zero, Zero dot BMP.

1168
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,800
So there it is and that assigns to Stone.

1169
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,500
So it should get in here.

1170
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,600
Why is it not, you know, you counted.

1171
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,400
That's why you don't count your code chickens before they hatch,

1172
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,700
right?

1173
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,900
You don't count your code chickens.

1174
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,700
Before they ask my stone is still not working.

1175
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,900
Seriously people, seriously, that is where we are at

1176
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
What's going on here?

1177
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,100
There's the grass, the grass works fine.

1178
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,100
But as soon as I switch the stone, I get nothing.

1179
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,600
Nothing on that screen.

1180
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,800
So why am I having trouble loading?

1181
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,100
Whatever that ground is.

1182
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,900
They're like, What's the problem?

1183
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,200
People Ground Zero Zero.

1184
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,400
Oops,

1185
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,000
The test too.

1186
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,700
So I'm going to step into that real quick because I want to know why

1187
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,400
that ain't.

1188
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,300
Why that ain't doing?

1189
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,200
No Loudoun.

1190
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,900
I don't see anything obviously stupid yet.

1191
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,100
So I'm going to I'm going to see.

1192
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,300
I want to know.

1193
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,600
Oh, we can restart the game.

1194
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,100
Duh loading.

1195
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,500
Only happens at startup right?

1196
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,300
All right, this time's a charm.

1197
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,300
I'm going to count the code chickens before they hatch.

1198
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:21,900
Here we go.

1199
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:22,800
Bam.

1200
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,000
That's what I'm talking about now.

1201
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,600
We've got that stone in there, right?

1202
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah.

1203
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,700
And you know what the heck?

1204
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,700
Just the top off.

1205
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,600
Just a top.

1206
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,500
It all off.

1207
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:37,800
You know?

1208
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,000
Why wouldn't you just, why wouldn't you just do this, right?

1209
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Why wouldn't you just go ahead and say, you know what?

1210
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,700
Let's tough it up.

1211
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:49,000
Let stuffed it because we've got the Tufts, you might as well use the

1212
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,500
Tufts.

1213
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,900
That's what I say.

1214
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,600
So, there we go.

1215
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:58,300
So, yeah, you know, it's not the world's most gorgeous looking ground

1216
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,800
in the world yet, but you can already kind of see, you know, once we

1217
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,600
kind of massage just a little, once we get this going and also

1218
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,400
No, once we give you no gangster in the opportunity, to kind of like,

1219
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,600
fill this up with cool Sprites and all that sort of stuff.

1220
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,300
Like once we are further down that road, you can kind of see how it's

1221
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,300
going to look cool, right?

1222
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,100
Like, it's going to look a lot better than if I was just having a

1223
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,300
little tilemap stamp down because it'll have this really nice organic

1224
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:26,800
feel to it.

1225
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,700
So I think we're going the right direction with that and and you know

1226
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:33,000
more on that to come later.

1227
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,100
But for now let's not belabor that point.

1228
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,800
Let's just go ahead and and say that we will start the Q&A here on day

1229
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,300
81.

1230
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,000
Please.

1231
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:51,400
If you could, please make sure to prefix your questions with Q: so

1232
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,200
that I can see them.

1233
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,000
And please try to keep your questions and stuff we did today or that

1234
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,100
we were going to do.

1235
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:02,300
I guess or that we had been working on but not on stuff that we're

1236
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,700
going to do later or off-topic questions because we'll do those, we do

1237
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,000
those in the pre stream.

1238
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,400
If you want to ask an off topic question, please come back about 15

1239
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,700
minutes before some scheduled start time on another day and ask it and

1240
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,000
we will cover it then.

1241
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,000
Cover it then.

1242
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,500
Yeah.

1243
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,100
Yeah.

1244
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,300
Yeah, the fancy autoload, dll stuff.

1245
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:38,100
So one of the things that that I said kind of at the beginning when we

1246
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,300
were talking about that is I was like, here's the stuff that doesn't

1247
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,600
do, right?

1248
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,500
Doesn't rerun the initialization code.

1249
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,400
You can't have pointers to functions or straight or hard-coded strings

1250
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,700
in there and you know, that's just the way it goes.

1251
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
You can fix that, right?

1252
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,400
You can solve these problems.

1253
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,600
And one thing that I will say is the problem that we had

1254
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,300
Tonight wasn't really a problem.

1255
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,600
You took a couple seconds to fit, I mean, well, a couple minutes to

1256
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:03,900
fix.

1257
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,600
It wasn't really a big deal, but the probably adds a night where it's

1258
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:10,400
like stuff getting loaded that actually when we do the asset

1259
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,700
streaming, that'll fix itself because the asset streaming would take

1260
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,100
care of that it would look and see oh I don't have something it would

1261
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,900
go grab it.

1262
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,600
So really that part is not too big of a concern because really the

1263
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,600
only reason we even see problems like that at the moment on for those

1264
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,600
loading things is because we don't have real loading code yet.

1265
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,600
So those two things will end up working together.

1266
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:35,500
Either, if that makes sense where you'll end up having the auto dll

1267
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,400
loading right now is actually weaker than it could be, because it's

1268
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,700
not backed by any other systems that are helping it.

1269
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,600
So, there's that,

1270
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,900
Is there an art team working on this game?

1271
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:59,800
There is an artist working on this game, but since I have to be so

1272
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,200
slow, I can only program one hour a night.

1273
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,400
If we actually had an art team working on this game, oh my God, they

1274
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,700
would be so far ahead of me, right?

1275
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,700
Like because because they can work 8 hours a day and I can only work

1276
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,600
one right?

1277
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,400
That's not good.

1278
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,000
So there's one artist working on the game and and that's a pretty good

1279
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,500
balance I think because I'm I can't go very fast because we cover

1280
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,400
everything on the Stream.

1281
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,900
So, you know, if there were any more than one artist and she's only

1282
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:32,100
part-time there's any more than one artist, it would there they'd be

1283
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,200
way too far ahead.

1284
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,500
I'm always the Coco says Max render.

1285
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,400
Number should be set to fix number 10, 000, 000, because episode 35,

1286
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,400
when you went to random.org, you chose to Generate random numbers from

1287
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,200
0 up to that number.

1288
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,800
So, yes and no.

1289
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:05,800
If you it depends what your goals are.

1290
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,500
If your goal is to make a fair random number generator, I agree with

1291
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:10,800
you.

1292
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,600
You need to be whatever the range was for the random number

1293
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,300
generation.

1294
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,700
But if you want to fill space

1295
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,900
Then know you want the random number generator to sometimes be able to

1296
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,200
produce the maximum value, right?

1297
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,100
Which in our case it would never would actually be able to do now if

1298
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,800
that makes sense.

1299
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,700
But so that's why I think it's actually better to use whatever the

1300
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,400
actual maximum was, but yeah.

1301
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,100
Obviously that wasn't a serious comment.

1302
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,900
What wasn't a serious comment?

1303
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,200
Pseudonym 73, what wasn't a serious comment?

1304
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,200
But on top of question, comment.

1305
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:07,100
Do you want to mention tangents when designing curves?

1306
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,600
Probably not now because they don't really mean anything in the

1307
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,200
context of the thing we were doing.

1308
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,200
So I'd rather save that for some time and we're talking about like

1309
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,800
maybe when we're doing animation because you know, it would be a

1310
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,700
little more natural to bring some of that stuff in because there's a

1311
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,400
lot of stuff we could talk about as far as solving for functions there

1312
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,600
and it's like, we don't really have any thing to motivate tangents in

1313
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,800
that example, because that was just a simple linear mapping, you know?

1314
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,200
Panic 00, would you ever actually use a higher degree polynomial

1315
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,900
interpolation aren't there better ways to make interpreting curves?

1316
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,200
That are more stable?

1317
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,200
So, okay, it depends what you're asking.

1318
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,800
So I'll answer answer the question you probably aren't asking but just

1319
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,800
to get it just so it's clear to everyone else and then I'll answer the

1320
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,100
question that you are asking, I think.

1321
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:16,300
But the question that you were asking is, would you ever use a higher

1322
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,000
degree?

1323
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,700
That the question that you literally asked that maybe you didn't mean

1324
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,300
was, would you ever actually use a higher degree polynomial

1325
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,100
interpolation?

1326
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,800
And the answer is, there's no such thing as interpolation that isn't

1327
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:30,600
hired.

1328
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,800
Re polynomials or the one we used, right?

1329
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,100
Like anything that you could name, pretty much.

1330
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,500
That was an interpolation is a polynomial interpolation of some kind,

1331
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,100
right?

1332
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,000
Bezier curve, that's polynomial.

1333
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,900
It's a its third order typically, sometimes it could be second order,

1334
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,700
right?

1335
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,700
B spline.

1336
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,900
Same old thing.

1337
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,900
That's a, you know, usually a third-order could sometimes be second

1338
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,400
order.

1339
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,900
There's there's rational and irrational ones, but

1340
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,800
Still that order, right?

1341
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,600
So yes.

1342
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,100
Do you use those higher ones?

1343
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,000
Absolutely.

1344
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,500
The standard polynomial you use in most part in most animation,

1345
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:19,800
interpolation is a x cubed plus BX squared, plus CX, plus CX, plus d,

1346
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:20,700
right?

1347
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,600
That's the standard that you're going to use the standard polynomial

1348
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,700
form, right?

1349
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:30,700
And you don't see it written this way because you see the terms

1350
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:35,600
arranged for efficiency in terms of evaluating, you know, bezier curve

1351
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
or something like that.

1352
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,500
But but it's still a third order polynomial.

1353
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,200
That's what a bezier.

1354
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,200
Curve is a bezier curve as a third order polynomial.

1355
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,800
Now, I'll answer the question that you were probably asking, which is

1356
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,600
not what literally got said, right?

1357
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,100
Because, you know, I know it's chat, right?

1358
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,000
It's hard to actually be specific about the question.

1359
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,100
It's not

1360
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,500
Great way of trying to communicate, right?

1361
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,600
So if you take a look at this, what I was talking about was solving

1362
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:11,200
for those points that procedure, the the solving for endpoints

1363
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,300
procedure, that is not typically used for interpolation.

1364
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,200
And the reason that it's not typically used for interpolation is

1365
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:26,100
because if you don't leave any extra degrees of freedom in your solve,

1366
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,900
for something called fairing, which were getting kind of off topic

1367
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,000
here but it's okay.

1368
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,400
I mean, it's on topic of Dane printer, just not what we were doing

1369
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:34,800
today.

1370
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,900
Per se, if you don't leave any extra degrees of freedom, what happens

1371
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,700
is your functions, do very undesirable things in terms of

1372
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,400
interpolation.

1373
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,600
So, for example, let's say you were going to use a third order thing

1374
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,900
and solve for it the way I did.

1375
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,800
So you have third order so you can specify for points.

1376
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,100
Remember, linear is two points, quadratic is 3 and

1377
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,400
And and cubic is for, it's always one more Point than the degree that

1378
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:00,800
you have.

1379
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:01,200
Right?

1380
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,400
And you can see exactly why that is.

1381
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,100
It's because there's a constant.

1382
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,900
So you're solving an equation in however, many, you know, whatever the

1383
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,100
order is, if it's third order, you're solving an equation in four

1384
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,800
unknowns, coefficient, on x squared, I've coefficient on X cubed,

1385
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:21,200
coefficient on x squared, coefficient on X and coefficient on X to the

1386
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,300
zeroth power.

1387
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:25,600
Right, there's x to the 0 here, which is the constant

1388
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,800
X to the zero with is, of course one, right.

1389
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,800
And so, if you take a look at at this and you say, well, I've got four

1390
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,300
unknowns.

1391
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:37,500
I can plug in four points, right?

1392
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:44,200
So you go like I want it to go here and here and here and here now any

1393
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,500
sane person takes a look at that and goes, oh no problem.

1394
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,700
I'm going to produce the interpolation.

1395
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,000
That looks like that, right?

1396
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,100
Of course you would.

1397
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,100
But what you don't realize is

1398
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,800
Actually, there is no third order polynomial.

1399
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:04,000
That looks like that, that passes through those three points, there's

1400
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,200
some other polynomial that does potentially but not that not third

1401
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,600
order.

1402
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,800
The third order polynomial that passes through these points actually

1403
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,800
looks like something ridiculous.

1404
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,800
Like, you know, this sort of a thing.

1405
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,100
I mean it will wouldn't have two bends in it but it's, you know, it's

1406
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,800
like that, right?

1407
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,399
That's the third order polynomial that actually passes through them

1408
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,300
and that and that are not what you wanted.

1409
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:35,100
You wanted a nice smooth interpolation.

1410
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,000
What you got was something that hit the exact mathematical values you

1411
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,300
input with.

1412
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:47,600
Third order equation, and that's just a limitation of that sort of way

1413
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,700
of stating the problem.

1414
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,400
And so typically you don't do this if you are trying to fit curves the

1415
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,200
things you use extra degrees of freedom and you do what's called

1416
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:04,400
fairing, which is basically saying we're going to put into the solve

1417
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,600
depending on how we choose to formulate, it mathematically, we're

1418
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,600
going to put into the solve the notion that we do not want extraneous

1419
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,400
wiggles, or things like this, right?

1420
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,900
And there's a lot of different ways you can do that.

1421
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,400
Like, one very simple way to

1422
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,000
That is remember I was sort of telling you about that thing where I

1423
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,600
said like oh okay you know maybe there's no way for a line to hit

1424
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:31,500
these three points.

1425
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,200
Remember I said that up above but I can formulate equations that give

1426
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:40,000
me like a line that passes you know as close to the three as possible

1427
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,800
so I can get that line out of it right.

1428
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,300
Well, the same is true for more complex interpolation.

1429
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:50,900
If I was to say, you know, I want you to use a parabola to hit these

1430
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:51,600
points.

1431
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,200
Well, a parabola is x squared.

1432
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,300
Plus, you know, x squared plus BX, plus C, right?

1433
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,400
Equals 0.

1434
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,900
That's my, that's my Parabola, right?

1435
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,900
So, if I'm going to solve for these three things, if I use again, more

1436
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,800
advanced math and I you like a least Square, solver something like

1437
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,200
this,

1438
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,600
I'm going to get by plugging these in, I'm gonna get a parabola that

1439
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,300
actually pretty nicely approximates those things.

1440
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:20,200
Right.

1441
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,300
And the reason that that happens is because the system now has a lot

1442
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,400
but the math has a lot more information about what you actually

1443
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,100
wanted.

1444
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,400
Right up here.

1445
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,700
All you told it was hit these four points and it's like, hey then I

1446
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:34,300
hit him.

1447
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,900
Right.

1448
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:41,400
Let's go get ice cream, but it didn't know that you're in your head.

1449
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,900
You were Imagining the smooth curve because nothing in the problem

1450
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,200
statement, said, what smooth was?

1451
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,500
You just had a preconceived notion, right?

1452
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,300
And the math doesn't know what your preconceived notions are.

1453
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,300
And so, one way to fix that, like a saying is add that information in.

1454
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,500
And so one thing you can do is use more advanced solving.

1455
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
Not like the straightforward literal equation.

1456
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,700
Solving we were doing here ones, where you're going to solve systems

1457
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:09,400
of equations that are more complicated than this.

1458
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,000
Even though we're still only trying to find a parabola.

1459
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,800
And what we're going to do is say let's specify those points.

1460
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
We were trying to hit like these three points.

1461
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,600
Let's say, but instead of it, then producing this kind of nasty thing

1462
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,000
that maybe we didn't want that has extra wiggles or whatever, we're

1463
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,800
going to add more points in so it knows that we want it to follow.

1464
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,600
Follow this path, right?

1465
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,000
And probably is probably a bad choice because usually The Wiggles a

1466
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,500
parabola can only curve once, right?

1467
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,200
So it's usually you usually need to be up in the X squared's before

1468
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,500
you start to see those extraneous Wiggles, right?

1469
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,000
But you can still have it says long story.

1470
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,300
This all gets into a lot of Animation stuff that maybe we'll talk

1471
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,600
about at least some of it only doing the animation stuff.

1472
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,600
But so point being what you may have been asking.

1473
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:01,200
And so I wanted to answer was was yet, do you want to do this solve

1474
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,300
for advanced interpolation stuff?

1475
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,900
And the answer is, no, you don't, you need to do more advanced styles

1476
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,600
of solving.

1477
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,300
But when you do those Advanced out of the sobbing, you're still

1478
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:14,100
working with the same equations, you will still solve for this

1479
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,100
equation.

1480
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:18,600
You just won't be solving it as directly.

1481
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,900
So, the answer to the literal question, you asked, would you use

1482
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,800
higher order polynomials?

1483
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,800
The answer is, yes, you absolutely would just not, you wouldn't find

1484
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,600
them through the same route that I was saying, right?

1485
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,000
Hopefully that.

1486
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,100
That makes some sense.

1487
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,600
Hi.

1488
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,400
Let's see, let's see.

1489
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,100
What sort of optimization would you do on that ground stamping?

1490
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:02,400
Well, I mean the answer to that is we're going to see exactly what

1491
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,100
kind of optimization I'm going to do on that ground stamping because

1492
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,400
that is the way that I plan to do the actual backgrounds for this

1493
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,000
game, as we go forwards and we need them to run efficiently.

1494
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,200
So, the answer is, I will probably take two different approaches to

1495
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,200
it, depending on whether we're running under Hardware acceleration or

1496
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,700
not.

1497
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,200
When we are not running under hard acceleration, what I'll probably do

1498
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:31,000
is use a compositing buffer so that we only do the ground stamping

1499
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,200
once for any area as it comes into view and then you know, so it was

1500
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,900
sort of like a sort of a rectangular update scheme where as we scroll

1501
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,200
around we only fill in the part we need and then

1502
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:47,400
It comes out we as you move away we kind of jettison, whatever parts

1503
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:47,800
we don't need.

1504
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:52,300
So it kind of be like a tiled updating scheme so that we don't every

1505
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,400
frame wreath stamp the whole ground area.

1506
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,100
Right.

1507
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,800
We're only re stamping a little new bit of it and

1508
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,100
Probably stick that on an extra threads potentially like, you know,

1509
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,800
that might be something that we have threads working on to speed

1510
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,500
things up and that sort of thing.

1511
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,300
Now, in Hardware Land, we have a lot more horsepower to play with.

1512
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:17,900
And so what I'll probably do there is we might still use a caching

1513
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,300
scheme like that, but it's on the GPU.

1514
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,700
So that we're doing that stamping on the GPU into a texture that we

1515
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,400
can reuse.

1516
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,400
So we don't have to do all that building every time.

1517
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,600
But a bunch of things we just won't blind in there.

1518
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:37,300
Will blind them every frame, such as the little ground Tufts, so that

1519
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,300
way we can have the grass, kind of respond to wind in that sort of

1520
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:40,500
stuff.

1521
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:42,300
So it's not pre composited in.

1522
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,700
So basically, we'll try to look for opportunities to use that extra

1523
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:50,900
GPU, horsepower to do something cool but will you know will have a

1524
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:53,800
scheme that works for the software renderer so we can kind of learn

1525
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,000
about how that works, right?

1526
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,800
You are treating both ends of the random numbers, the same, but the

1527
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,400
current system you can get one, but you will never get 0 because you

1528
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,000
are not considering the Min though.

1529
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,700
Perhaps you're not getting, you're getting close on scary.

1530
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:31,600
Yeah, so again, like I wasn't really being particular about this.

1531
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,300
Even the max one, I wasn't really mean particular.

1532
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,200
I just wanted something that would roughly work.

1533
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:42,400
So when we're going to will, maybe we could even just go ahead and

1534
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,700
talk about the random number generator sometime soon and actually put

1535
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,300
in a real one.

1536
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,400
The real one is not going to have these little

1537
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:48,200
Stations.

1538
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:53,800
And so in theory, this is all kind of not that useful, but yeah, we

1539
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,000
could easily say, all right?

1540
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,200
If we know if we wanted to make this so that you could actually

1541
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,100
produce zero out of it as well.

1542
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,800
What you would do is you'd say, okay, this this, this equation here,

1543
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,200
right?

1544
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:09,000
Where I'm dividing it out.

1545
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,800
So I'm producing a number between zero and one cure, but we know that

1546
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,600
will never actually be 0 because we know that random number table

1547
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,300
could never return a 0.

1548
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,400
What we would do is say

1549
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,200
Say, oh, okay.

1550
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:23,500
Well, you know, whatever it does return, we subtract them in from

1551
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:23,700
that.

1552
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:29,100
So now that we know it does go from zero to the max minus Min and then

1553
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,100
we divide by that new, you know, range.

1554
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,000
So it'd be very simple to add that in.

1555
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,100
But again, like I don't really super care about this at.

1556
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:38,600
All right.

1557
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,900
Now, and this random number table.

1558
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,100
Table is not something we actually want to use in production.

1559
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:47,500
It's just something to avoid having us have to discuss how to

1560
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,600
Generate random numbers right now and or more, simply back when we

1561
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,400
first put it in, but we will be talking about Generate random numbers

1562
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,800
and then we'll have a random number generator which will have

1563
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
More of an opinion about how it produces hours and we'll make sure it

1564
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,800
can produce all the numbers between 0 and 1 that are floating point,

1565
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,200
you know?

1566
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:28,200
Let's see.

1567
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,400
Do you plan on having things like dirt paths and if so would you draw

1568
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,000
them using Splats and stamps?

1569
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah.

1570
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,800
I think we will draw them using Splats and stamps but again like

1571
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:49,000
certain elements of the ground might have to have additional logic

1572
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,200
like I mean, you know, like we're not going to just throw stuff on the

1573
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:53,100
ground like this.

1574
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:53,400
This is

1575
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,200
To get things started.

1576
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,200
So we're talking about things like a dirt path or maybe more more,

1577
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,800
interestingly dirt.

1578
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,600
Path isn't isn't perhaps all that useful because that's a very

1579
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,200
calculus up.

1580
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,500
But let's say Cobblestone path, something with a regular pattern on

1581
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:08,800
it.

1582
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,800
When we find ourselves wanting to implement stuff like that, we will

1583
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,800
have to be more careful about how we are doing.

1584
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,100
This stamping process if we want something that's going to be a

1585
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,500
reasonable result, right?

1586
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,000
And so, certain things are going to be harder to do than others.

1587
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,400
Now, maybe what we'll decide as we just don't care, we don't want to

1588
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,100
spend the time on that, we'd rather spend the time on something else,

1589
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,700
so we won't do that for something.

1590
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,900
But assuming we get to the point where like we really want a nice, you

1591
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,200
know, Cobblestone path in here.

1592
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,900
And, you know,

1593
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,900
Randomly sort of throwing down stamps is not going to do that.

1594
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,400
We got to start thinking about how we're really going to align things

1595
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,900
and do things in a useful way.

1596
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:49,600
They're right.

1597
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,600
So, we'll look tack those we come to it, but we will still do some

1598
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,100
kind of procedural generation for them.

1599
01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:03,600
It may just not be, it might not be such a free-form stamping as as

1600
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:05,200
what we sort of started with here, right?

1601
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,500
So your ground texture design is essentially Mega texture.

1602
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,600
No, I wouldn't really call it Mega texture.

1603
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:25,100
I mean, so there's a lot of elements to megatexture assuming that

1604
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,300
you're talking about in Tech 5,

1605
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:33,400
And we're not really using sort of what I would say is.

1606
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:44,900
So we really need a way to take polls his what we need because I can

1607
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,600
explain to you exactly why this isn't Mega texture.

1608
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,700
But I'm not sure if that's actually something that's interesting to

1609
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:54,600
people like because you know, Mega textures like this esoteric thing

1610
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,700
John Carmack made.

1611
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,900
And you know, explaining why we're not that.

1612
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:06,900
Maybe not super useful but but yeah.

1613
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,400
Based on the screen, it appears that you need to know math to do this

1614
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,200
type of activity.

1615
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,400
Is that correct?

1616
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,500
That is correct.

1617
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:19,500
Yes, you do need to know math to do this kind of activity.

1618
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:30,600
Trial for any more on-topic questions again, for people asking stuff,

1619
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:36,100
like did you learn higher-level Concepts from University or elsewhere?

1620
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,700
Those are good questions for the pre stream.

1621
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:42,200
If you want to come back tomorrow, you know, anytime before a

1622
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,000
scheduled start time, we were at 8:00 p.m.

1623
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,600
tomorrow.

1624
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
So if you come at like 7:45 and ask questions like that, we do random

1625
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,000
questions that aren't like that aren't specifically on what we're

1626
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:52,600
working on.

1627
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,000
Anything else?

1628
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,000
I think I got everything.

1629
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:21,100
I think I got everything so I guess I'll try to explain in three

1630
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:26,900
minutes since there are no other further questions, the V on topic

1631
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:27,500
question.

1632
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
It was totally on topic of whether the ground texture sign is

1633
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,300
essentially megatexture.

1634
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,600
I'll give it a go for you.

1635
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:38,700
All right.

1636
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:48,000
So this is this was this was my plan over here and this is Mega

1637
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,000
texture over here.

1638
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:55,700
So, my plan was simply to say, all right?

1639
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,100
We've got a screen, right?

1640
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,700
And so I'm just going to assume that that screen is you know broken up

1641
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,400
into chunks that I want to compute, right?

1642
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,200
Like so on.

1643
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,600
And I'm just going to say, alright for any given screen, let's see

1644
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,200
what the chunks are that are available.

1645
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,800
Let's do the chunks are that are visible, right?

1646
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,800
So again, it's very much like, where we do for our entity spatial

1647
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,100
partition, it's the same thing.

1648
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,700
In fact, we could even tie it to that.

1649
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,100
It could actually be in the tile.

1650
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:24,500
Chunks we go.

1651
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,800
And say, did we produce this one yet or not?

1652
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:30,000
If we, and do we have it, like, in a cash basis or not?

1653
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,300
If we do, we just draw it.

1654
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,300
If we don't, we say, we need to generate it right?

1655
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,500
We generate it and we store it for future.

1656
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,500
Really, really simple, that's it.

1657
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
So I'm just talking about looping through those things.

1658
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,800
And then basically, you know, if you think about what we've got,

1659
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:51,500
there's basically a cache of these things, right, entries?

1660
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,800
And so we look through here and we say, okay to render this, we need,

1661
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,800
you know, we need a b c, d, e, f, g, h i tiles.

1662
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:00,900
Right.

1663
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:07,700
And in the cache are a you know see G and H.

1664
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,800
So it goes like okay got a render this tile.

1665
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,800
Do we have that a?

1666
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,100
Yeah we've got it, put it in there.

1667
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:12,700
Great.

1668
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,100
All right we've got be.

1669
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:14,800
Do we have that?

1670
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,800
Put it in there great.

1671
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,600
And I may not even go that far, right?

1672
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:22,100
I may just say all right, you know what, this is way simpler than

1673
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,500
that, we don't have to worry about that.

1674
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,700
Really, we've just got a screens worth.

1675
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,400
So we know we have the screen filled on the previous thing.

1676
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,400
We now know we moved some some amount so the you know, we moved the

1677
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,100
screen.

1678
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,500
So basically, like this is the part we have filled, but this is the

1679
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:41,300
part we need to view which means that this part

1680
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,600
Is still we still have.

1681
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:45,400
Right?

1682
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,800
So we just draw that part from before and then we just fill in this

1683
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,300
part over here, right?

1684
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,200
So it's like a dirty wrecked up to the scheme.

1685
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:56,800
So we might even be simpler than even that right?

1686
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,100
Mega texture has a lot more to it.

1687
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:04,600
What megatexture does is megatexture says that essentially there is

1688
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,000
just one giant image, right?

1689
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,300
And that giant image is broken up into tiles.

1690
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,300
So it looks sort of like this game at the head end but first what

1691
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:20,200
happens is the you allow the GPU right?

1692
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,000
Or whatever.

1693
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,300
The rendering system is to First do a pre pass.

1694
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:29,900
So you know so step one is you do a pre pass on the screen and you

1695
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,200
draw everything, right?

1696
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,600
So you actually draw, you know, the game with the hero and the little

1697
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:36,900
Sprites and whatever.

1698
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,900
They're right, you know.

1699
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,400
I mean, and then you say, OK, when we do that drawing, instead of

1700
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,900
actually drawing the color values, we actually want, instead, we just

1701
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:55,500
draw, you know, IDs, we draw something that tells us what we would

1702
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,200
have needed to sample from, in terms of textures, it sort of bitmaps

1703
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,300
for each individual location, right?

1704
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,300
So, this thing doesn't look at all like an image.

1705
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,800
When we draw it in step one, it looks like a total

1706
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,600
mess of colors, right?

1707
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,500
Because those colors are actually IDs.

1708
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:15,500
That tell us things, we then look through that and we say like okay

1709
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:20,400
find all the IDS in the cash, right?

1710
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:23,700
So we say anything that showed up on the screen then we look at the

1711
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:26,000
cash you know this thing.

1712
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:29,500
Same sort of idea ABC here, right?

1713
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,600
So that part similar.

1714
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,500
Find all of those, right?

1715
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,800
And and, and, and use them.

1716
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:44,800
But unlike this scheme, they're not actually laid out as a cash if you

1717
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,800
will, they're laid out as an image.

1718
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,500
So they're laid out in a scheme where, you know, they would they're

1719
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:54,500
they're in there.

1720
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,400
This is really hard to explain.

1721
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,200
This is going to take this is going to take too long.

1722
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,300
All right, so that's not actually true.

1723
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,900
You could Implement, megatexture was, let's, let's just go with it.

1724
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:16,400
I'm not going to say how they actually do it.

1725
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,100
Normally because it says, it's actually laid out in a texture and

1726
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,600
there's other consequence to it, but let's ignore that because that's

1727
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,300
kind of cheap you think.

1728
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,000
So let's say they were in a cash, right?

1729
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,800
You find all the ideas in the cache but the key thing to understand is

1730
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,100
unlike my scheme, where there's just some number of things, I was

1731
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:37,200
saying, you know, there's 64 tiles in the cash and that's it.

1732
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,300
So you found it you found it.

1733
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,400
If not you throw something out of the cache and

1734
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,700
Pullin you make a new one, right?

1735
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,600
And you put it in there.

1736
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,800
That's not what happens here.

1737
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,100
All tiles are in the cache all the time in mega texture.

1738
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:54,900
So you will always find that the the ID that you wanted, the thing

1739
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,000
that you wanted will always actually be in there.

1740
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
The question is just what resolution and so what Mega texture does,

1741
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,200
you know, if you think about it it starts with like one 4096 4096

1742
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,100
texture or something, right?

1743
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,600
Or whatever the size is, I don't know what the minimum size is, maybe

1744
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,100
it's more than that.

1745
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,000
Maybe it's just 1226 by 256.

1746
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:16,600
You could implement it, however, you want it.

1747
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:20,900
It starts by saying when I start the game, I have one 256 by 256

1748
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,500
texture, that's already like a tile.

1749
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,800
In fact, the I guess you would probably implement that way whatever

1750
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,300
your tile size is you'd say, I've got one of those, that's the whole

1751
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,000
game.

1752
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,800
Every image in the game is in this 2056 text.

1753
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,500
If I 26 character, right?

1754
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:43,000
So it's all packed in there, where like this one pixel represents like

1755
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,900
a whole town or something.

1756
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,100
The average color of like a whole town, right?

1757
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:49,700
I'm not really exaggerating.

1758
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:55,500
This is actually how it works and so then what you say is, all right,

1759
01:28:55,900 --> 01:29:01,400
the cash is not little tiles that correspond to things on the screen.

1760
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,900
The cash is like, multi-resolution, one of the tiles, which may never

1761
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,500
be evicted, is this?

1762
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,000
We're tile that has the whole game in it.

1763
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,400
So if I need to look up, IDs 63, right?

1764
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:21,000
Well, if 63 doesn't exist at a high resolution and our or a low

1765
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,300
resolution or any resolution, really, I can always fall back to

1766
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:28,700
whatever Texel coordinated was in this to video scientific sector and

1767
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:32,700
draw the thing at its average color for the region, right?

1768
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,000
So there is no failure case for this, it just gets lower and lower

1769
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,500
resolution, right?

1770
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:42,500
And then when I do fail to find something in the cache at the

1771
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,000
resolution, I wanted.

1772
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,600
So I'll always succeed in finding it, but I might not find it at the

1773
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:47,300
residence I wanted.

1774
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:53,100
So this this idea of 63 also says, like, oh, it's 63 at a detailed

1775
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:54,900
level 7, right?

1776
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,800
I then say, okay, if fix something from the

1777
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,100
That's like a least recently used thing or something like that and go

1778
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:08,800
load this one so that soon I will be able to draw it at the right

1779
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:09,500
resolution.

1780
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:17,200
So, the cash ends up actually being this sort of multi this thing,

1781
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,500
that stores things and all kinds of resolutions and you're constantly

1782
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:26,500
sort of putting new things fresher lower lower or higher, resolution

1783
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,300
things in there depending on how you are trying to manage that cash

1784
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:29,900
out.

1785
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,600
Right.

1786
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,600
Does that make some sense?

1787
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,500
So I'm sorry I didn't do a very good job explaining that I really need

1788
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:38,600
a long time to swing by the mega texture but it's not really.

1789
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,200
This this is much.

1790
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:46,600
Fuller, then this is, and really, this is not a good choice.

1791
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:49,600
Well, I might argue, this is not a good choice period, because there's

1792
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,000
reasons that Mega texture is not a good design in my opinion.

1793
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:58,900
Look, I don't think Mega texture was a good idea if that makes sense.

1794
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,300
But even if you thought it was a good idea in 3D, I think you would

1795
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:08,600
really say it's not a good idea in 2D because what this is designed to

1796
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,400
handle is the fact that you don't really know ahead of time what the

1797
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,100
bitmaps are that you're going to need because 3D so complicated in,

1798
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:18,200
you're looking over vast Vistas and then down at the floor and all

1799
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:18,400
these.

1800
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,100
Right?

1801
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,800
And so it's trying to manage that level of detail stuff.

1802
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,900
Really cleanly, that's its goal.

1803
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:26,800
We don't have that.

1804
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:27,800
We're 2-D game.

1805
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,000
We know that everything is basically going to be the same resolution.

1806
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,700
It doesn't.

1807
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:35,200
You don't get this sort of Longview distance close-up.

1808
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,700
Zoom thing happening.

1809
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,000
And so we can pretty much just no we don't need multiple resolution

1810
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
versions of these tiles.

1811
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,900
Really we know exactly the resolution.

1812
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,200
We're going to need all the time and we know it in advance it's like

1813
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:47,900
it's a stuffs coming over here.

1814
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:52,200
So there may be some places where we have to work through it like with

1815
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,800
animations, we're not sure exactly what we're going to need to load or

1816
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,300
something there maybe.

1817
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,200
Some parts that are a little bit trickier for us.

1818
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,000
But on the whole it's just not the kind of situation where we need

1819
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:07,000
that Dynamic level of detail, fungibility that Mega texture was

1820
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,300
designed to give you.

1821
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,200
And furthermore, we certainly don't need this step.

1822
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,300
Although you could argue that, you know what, you could still maybe

1823
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,900
call it Mega texture, even if you don't have this step where you draw

1824
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:17,000
it.

1825
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,800
See what IDs but we definitely need that because we know exactly all

1826
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,400
the stuff that's going to be drawn pretty much and we just won't, we

1827
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:25,300
don't have the kind of

1828
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:29,400
Including things, including other things or that, or the backs of

1829
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,500
things not being visible.

1830
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,600
We don't have much of that in a 2-D game.

1831
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:36,400
We kind of know what's getting composited and we know that if it's not

1832
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:39,100
visible right now, it'll be visible soon, right?

1833
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,800
Whereas that's not the case in 3D, so hopefully that I don't know,

1834
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,800
maybe that answer that a little bit, but there you go.

1835
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:51,300
Why do you think John Carmack is a hack?

1836
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,100
And when are you going to say it to his face?

1837
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,300
I don't think John Carmack is the heck?

1838
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,600
I think John Carmack is one of the greatest game programmers that

1839
01:32:58,600 --> 01:32:59,800
that's ever lived.

1840
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,300
I just think, like, any programmer, even the greatest programmer that

1841
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:11,200
ever lived doesn't always hit the mark megatexture just wasn't a great

1842
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:11,800
scheme.

1843
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,100
Right?

1844
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,400
And, you know, maybe he disagree with that.

1845
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:16,700
Maybe he thinks it was successful.

1846
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:21,200
I just I just don't think it was a good design and that's easy to say

1847
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:24,100
in hindsight, you know, he doesn't know going into it, he invented the

1848
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:28,000
thing and a lot of times when you make something when you're working

1849
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
on it, the first time, you don't know if it's going to

1850
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
To be good or not, you've got an idea and you've you think that

1851
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,300
something could work but you know, whether it actually pans out on the

1852
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,700
end exactly the way that you'd hoped and whether it solves the

1853
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,300
problem, you hope was going to solve in an elegant way you don't.

1854
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,900
It's very hard to know, but something especially as complicated as

1855
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:47,100
Mega texture and in an environment, like a bag of extras been

1856
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:50,800
developed, where gpus were a lot more primitive than they were today.

1857
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,800
There's just, it's just very difficult, right?

1858
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:58,100
And so, John Carmack has made a lot of very good engine design

1859
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,900
decisions throughout his career.

1860
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,900
air and so hopefully I would think he would not mind me saying that

1861
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:12,800
one of them was not particularly good because I mean the guys got a

1862
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,000
very long track record of very great designs behind him and and yeah

1863
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,700
not only that but John Carmack

1864
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:23,400
He ain't the most emotionally, volatile, dude out there.

1865
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,600
And so, even if, for some reason, he was paying any attention to what

1866
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,300
I had to say which is unlikely in the first place.

1867
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,400
He doesn't care.

1868
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:34,500
Right.

1869
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,000
In fact, what he would probably care most about was that I didn't do a

1870
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
good job explaining it because he's a kind of technical fellow and so

1871
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:43,700
that would be the thing.

1872
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,700
He'd be like, yeah, you didn't explain megatexture very well.

1873
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:46,400
I'm like, yeah, I know.

1874
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,200
I was under time pressure, man.

1875
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:55,500
But what I can say is also if you do want to learn about Mega texture,

1876
01:34:55,500 --> 01:35:03,300
more specifically, I would encourage you to go look up sparse virtual

1877
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:04,100
textures.

1878
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,900
There's a video by Sean Barrett at nothing's.

1879
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,900
Is his Twitter handle Sean Barrett.

1880
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:26,300
She has a whole video where he shows how they work and he does a great

1881
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:30,600
job explaining them and he also covers the actual minutiae of it, like

1882
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,900
how you do mipmapping on it trilinear and padding and all that sort of

1883
01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:36,400
stuff.

1884
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:41,300
And he shifts sample code to, you can go down the same code, you can

1885
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,600
just see, you could be like, you're some, I get extra Works.

1886
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,800
Here's a complete working example, right?

1887
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:51,100
And so, so I would highly encourage you that if you were curious about

1888
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:55,900
actually not, you know, a better explanation than what I gave for how

1889
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,200
Mega texturing works.

1890
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,800
I would highly recommend that you check out

1891
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,700
Lecture on that because that will totally clear it up for you.

1892
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,400
So there you go.

1893
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:17,100
All right, folks, that is the end of another hopefully non regrettable

1894
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:21,600
incident another episode of handmade hero.

1895
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,300
So thank you all for joining me this evening.

1896
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:29,200
I'm glad I was able to to make it home in time to do the stream.

1897
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,200
It was fun.

1898
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,800
I'm glad we did something kind of light and fluffy that kind of

1899
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,400
cleared, the kind of cleared the mood for the day out for me.

1900
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,200
So now I can go

1901
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:39,800
Go to bed a little happier and that's good.

1902
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:45,400
So again, if you, if you are somebody, who wants to follow along at

1903
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,300
home, you can always pre-order the game on handmade hero dot-org and

1904
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:50,100
it comes to source code.

1905
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,800
So if you want to play around with stuff like we talked about tonight,

1906
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:53,900
you can go ahead and do that.

1907
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:54,800
You can pre-order it on him.

1908
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,200
A hero dot-org comes the source code, you get a link in your email

1909
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,900
save that link because you can download the source every night.

1910
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So every time I update it you can redownload it again.

1911
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
So don't forget.

1912
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:04,900
So that's a good thing.

1913
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,200
We also have if you want to support the video series if you like it,

1914
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,600
It and want to support it.

1915
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,200
You can always subscribe on our patreon page as well.

1916
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,100
We also have a news and Forum site that community members contribute

1917
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:17,900
to its got a Forums on their people answer questions and I answer

1918
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:18,700
questions too.

1919
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,300
Sometimes I get annoyed and and, and post annoying things.

1920
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:25,900
But most of the time I post good answers.

1921
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:26,300
Okay.

1922
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:30,400
Most of the time I do and then we also have a schedule bot, which

1923
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,500
tweets the schedule at you.

1924
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:37,000
So if you want to know when the streams are coming up, you can check

1925
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,100
that out and it keeps you up to date.

1926
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,000
So definitely check all that stuff out and hopefully I'll see you back

1927
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,500
here again.

1928
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,200
Tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.

1929
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:47,800
Pacific Standard Time actually pacific daylight time.

1930
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,300
I think those are they coincide?

1931
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:50,700
I don't know how time zones work.

1932
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,400
I think they're made to be maximally confusing to everyone but it's at

1933
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,000
8 p.m.

1934
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,300
on the west coast of America, whatever that time zone is called right

1935
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,700
now, PST PDT song.

1936
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:02,800
And so I

1937
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,300
Hope to see you here for that.

1938
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:08,000
It would be nice to get another night of programming in with you.

1939
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,800
And we will maybe play around with that ground code a little bit more

1940
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,100
because it wasn't quite done with just kind of fussing with that.

1941
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:15,500
So, I know it's not really what we're supposed to be doing.

1942
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,900
Now, bolts we do a little, maybe we'll be able to make this week, be

1943
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,400
playing a little and then start back on the Collision detection

1944
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,700
finalization stuff next week.

1945
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,900
We're trying to clean that up.

1946
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:27,500
So anyway, thank you very much for joining me and I hope to see you

1947
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,000
tomorrow.

1948
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Take it easy everybody.
