1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,500
Live.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome to handmade hero.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,100
The show we could have complete game live on stream.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,400
We kind of did some absolutely crazy stuff yesterday, which is kind of

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,000
on a whim.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,600
I was like, I kind of wanted to be able to have the concept that I

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,200
would have compiled time constants that were actually changeable at

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,900
runtime.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,700
And so we just did a little experiment to see if that would work.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,800
And it turns out it worked quite easily.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,800
So I think that what am I, you know,

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,500
One.

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Good, good random trick deserves.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,300
Another.

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,600
I think we should just go ahead and, and travel on down that road.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,400
See where it takes us, really?

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,400
Because all I want to do now is see if I can make that into a slightly

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,600
slightly more General system, that allows me to kind of pull out all

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,900
the debug code that you've written.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,200
So far is me.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,100
And make it so that I can switch all of our debug code on.

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,400
And off really trivially runtime.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,599
If I want to, without actually having to incur any overhead at all in

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,000
having compiled into the game.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
Again, like I said, it's never something I never tried before, I just

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
thought it should be possible.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,200
And so we tried it yesterday and it seemed to work quite well.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,600
So I'm going to see if it's realistic to kind of make it go a little

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,400
further than that.

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,400
So let's see what seem to have the hiccups for some reason.

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Which is kind of crazy.

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,900
But anyway,

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
we are here on day one ninety three.

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,200
So if you want to follow along at home and you've pre-order the game

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
on Hammer here at our org day 192 is the source code, you want to

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,400
start with so that you will be where I am at the moment if you want to

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,500
code along.

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,400
So here's what we did yesterday.

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,200
It was pretty cool.

40
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,200
What we did is we made it so that we could recompile things.

41
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,700
So this just is like a user interface action I can do which actually

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,600
causes the game to recompile with a different set of pound Defiance,

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,400
which totally changed.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,900
Is the code for the game, and in this case it toggles, whether the

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,300
debug camera is on or off, right?

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,300
And so, what I want to do now is figure out, okay?

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,300
We know we now have an infrastructure that allows us to do that

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,100
change.

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,300
And so the question is, what is a way that we can very easily Loft

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,500
that into something where we can do that kind of code all over the

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,900
place for very little cost, right?

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,300
And so, I would assume that the easiest way to kind of

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,300
figure that out is to just go try to do it right to go.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,300
Try to figure out like okay, where are these places that were having

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
these debug events occur?

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,200
Where I want to be able to toggle things on and off and how can I go

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
in there and make it easy for me to kind of change all that stuff into

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
easy to toggle stuff and that will also guide you know like I said we

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,800
want to go through and like make this interface a little more real

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,100
clean.

61
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,700
It up instead of just kind of this little test radial menu thing in

62
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,800
here that the overlapping words and it's ugly and doesn't really do

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,900
what we would want to do.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,300
Are so it can kind of guide us too because we want to do a pass over

65
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
this to get more interface stuff in here.

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,800
And so when we have a bunch of things that we actually do care about

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
setting or toggling or that sort of thing, then I feel like that would

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,000
be a good point for us to kind of go you know figure out how this

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,900
interface is going to look right.

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,900
Okay, so what would we do here?

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,100
Let's let's go.

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,300
Let's go into the code and just see

73
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
What we could do here?

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,800
So we already have like, we have some code, that's already kind of

75
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
doing this sort of stuff.

76
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,600
We've got pushed wrecked outline, for example.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,700
And so, let's just take a look at this one right here.

78
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,500
So if we were to take a look at that, this was the thing that would

79
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,800
show us where our ground tile, you know, where the, where the

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
boundaries were on our ground tiles.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,900
So that's a good example of something that we probably would want to

82
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,800
be able to turn on and off, right?

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,300
And so if we follow the example of the thing that

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Have at the moment, then what we would do you rate is, we'd come over

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,800
into this, handmade config thing, and we'd go ahead and say, oh, okay.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,400
So there's another thing, which is like, you know, debug UI, I don't

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,500
know, wrecked ground, chunk outlines, write something like that.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
And then in here, I would, I would put it in there.

89
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,300
You know what I mean?

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
And that would, again, tell me.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,500
How that was working.

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,600
And so then we could easily toggle that on and off using the same

93
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
methodology.

94
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,100
So, I'm going to go ahead and keep doing that for some of these.

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,600
In fact, maybe I'll just look for a like, if zeros and see what's

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,100
going on here.

97
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,600
So, I don't think thats, that's probably not code we would super care

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:46,900
about.

99
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
But here, it's like a okay.

100
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,700
So here's another example.

101
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,700
So we also had a part of particle Fountain, right?

102
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,800
We had a particle fountain in here that was running, so that was, I

103
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,500
don't know what that was doing or why that was happening or wasn't

104
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,000
happening or

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Her else.

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,400
So I feel like that is another thing that that we might want on.

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Now, for some reason, I'm not seeing our particle Fountain.

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
I don't know if we turned it off, in some way.

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,400
That was more violent than that.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,600
Lets see lets probably.

111
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,100
Okay.

112
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
And we're not rendering them either.

113
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,200
Is another thing?

114
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,700
It looks like know we are rendering them.

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,400
Here they are.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,500
So I'm not sure what we did to to we never

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Like we never actually get a bitmap from them for some reason, that's

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,700
kind of weird.

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,200
Or is that not what happened?

121
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,500
Hmm, let's take a look at why our particle system isn't running

122
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,000
anymore.

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
It's called, it's actually, we're getting a bit mats as guest best

124
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,200
match right there.

125
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,000
So we're running through the particle spawn index.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,200
Were we're sort of making some of these things here.

127
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,600
We're creating them.

128
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,700
and that all,

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Reasonable.

130
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,300
But I can't actually see.

131
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,800
Did we change something in here?

132
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,500
That would make that not work properly.

133
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,600
The push wrecked thing.

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,500
So this is I guess we could take a look at this as well to look at

135
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,900
those cell cell Dimensions so the particle effect is is happening.

136
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,900
It's working so but we're just not seeing ever.

137
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,200
So there's something janky about our push bitmap.

138
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Call our push-fit map call is like not working at all for whatever

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,000
reason.

140
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,200
Now maybe that's because like the font or

141
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Thing is not there or something, I'm not sure.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
That could be one reason why?

143
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,600
The particle is not particle laying like if our font which I guess.

144
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't actually know what we did with that font I guess we just said

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,100
get best mismatch from asset font.

146
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,600
Oh yeah this is just this is just old.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,100
We need to actually load a particular font bitmap ID and right now

148
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,500
we're not doing that at all so that's that's why

149
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,500
So that's totally it.

150
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
So I guess what I'll do is I'll just go back to what we're doing

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,300
before.

152
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll go back to the Head Fountain, right?

153
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,900
And that should, that should solve it.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,500
So there's the head Fountain doing its Fountain thing, so that's good.

155
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,400
All right, so yeah, so if we look at this, you know, we could again

156
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,400
continue to kind of just, just going ahead and putting this out there.

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Oh, so you know, that's another pretty interesting thing.

158
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,600
You see what just happened there since our system rewrites, this file.

159
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:43,800
I feel like I feel like we have to make sure we always respect, what's

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,900
been already added to it, right?

161
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,600
Because otherwise we're going to have the situation where it's going

162
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
to overwrite things that we add.

163
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,700
So another thing that we need to do, when we come in here, we want to

164
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,100
make sure that we don't have that, it's not going rogue, right?

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,300
And it's not over writing it.

166
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,700
I think there are some ways that we can do that pretty easily

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,600
actually.

168
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,700
And maybe that don't even require making that file at all.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
But I'm just going to kind of go through the motions here so we can

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm not going to jump.

171
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,400
To what I think the conclusion is especially because I don't actually

172
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
know what the necessarily right answer is.

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,300
I'm just hypothesizing.

174
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,200
So I'm going to continue going through the motions so I can kind of

175
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,800
see my for myself exactly how it goes out.

176
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,700
So I can do particle test, right?

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
I'll also do.

178
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Debug you, I particle grid so we can see that.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,700
and,

180
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,800
Just might seating here.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,500
Let's see what else we got.

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,300
We've got rectangular outlines for our space.

183
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,700
Debug UI spaces.

184
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
You space Out Lines.

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
There's just a ton of code in here.

186
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
You can see it, right?

187
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,800
How much code there is in here, that was debug.

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,400
That's just turned off, you know, and you can kind of see if you

189
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,100
actually look at it all how much debug code there is.

190
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,700
And most of that debug code is was only accessible to us if we went

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,600
and found that if zero or whatever and it's kind of easy to forget all

192
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
of the debug code that we actually could use to find bugs, or do

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
whatever else.

194
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,400
I don't know if this code works at all anymore.

195
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Presumably not right, but I'm not sure.

196
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,300
So let's see.

197
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,900
Draw rectangles?

198
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,400
Function does not take four arguments.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,300
How many arguments does it take?

200
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,500
Might be the good, might be the thing to tell me.

201
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,900
It's like, it doesn't take for, but I'm not going to tell you how many

202
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,500
it takes.

203
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm just gonna let you guess.

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:51,700
Why?

205
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,200
Not, it's fine.

206
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,600
So let's see.

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Cliprect I and Brule even

208
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,200
In there.

209
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,400
Hmm.

210
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,900
So we don't have one that just passes the regular thing in so we have

211
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,100
clipped recti and bull even we never really use the even odd thing.

212
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,000
Did we we still have never done anything where we actually try to get

213
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,700
hyper threads on the, making sure they do the same even or odd of a

214
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
particular bitmap thing.

215
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,500
I wonder if we should probably remove that some point, I'm going to

216
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
make sure that that's on our little list here.

217
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Right now, let's see.

218
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,900
Let's see, let's see.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That would be in here.

220
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,300
Get rid of even notion.

221
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
So yeah, we've got draw a rectangle.

222
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,300
I need to pass it kind of the whole rectangle, but I don't really

223
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,500
remember what this code super did.

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,600
But it looks like it's just going over the log height and the log

225
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,800
width and making a checkerboard.

226
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,200
So I assume that the rectangle to I for clipping right rectangle to

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,700
White clip wreck could be, you know, erect min, max of 0 0.

228
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,300
Log with W Hite, I'm assuming

229
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,400
Would be totally fine, and it would work.

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,800
Oops.

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,400
Although, I guess I could do it this way as well.

232
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:28,700
There we go.

233
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,500
So now we got the clip rect and then I guess we'll do true for evens

234
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,900
and false for odds as annoying as that is.

235
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,100
And then I don't actually know like I said if this code works anymore

236
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,900
because we kind of played with the renderer quite a bit and I would

237
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,700
not actually have expected it to to work so I think it is running.

238
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,900
You can see that it's going very slowly but I suspect that it's not

239
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,800
drawing to the right place on the screen or something because we

240
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
didn't I don't think we ever updated it.

241
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,500
To the projection code.

242
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm talking about this stuff down here where we, where we do the push

243
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
coordinate system stuff.

244
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,700
I don't know that that's actually working.

245
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,200
So we'll leave that turned off for now.

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,500
And when we go back to do our lighting, will deal with that, right?

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So I'm going to go ahead and grep for pound of 0 and see where else.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,900
We see that.

249
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Let's take a look.

250
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,100
That is 0.

251
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,000
Such that is a thing that allows us to see alternating chunks without

252
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,700
putting lines in between them right.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
It's kind of interesting, Phil Gramm, shank with so that makes a

254
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,700
checkerboard pattern.

255
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,400
So if we wanted to I guess if we were talking about the config file,

256
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,900
we could do Define debug UI round chunk checkerboards.

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,500
That.

258
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Do something like this.

259
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,800
And now we can actually see that that pattern as well.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,100
So that could be useful.

261
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
So we've got that we go back to our grep.

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Oops.

263
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
What else we got here?

264
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,400
This adds walls, this was for Rural gen, which I don't think I care

265
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:35,900
about.

266
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
So I'm going to ignore that for now.

267
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,600
This is well that's totally valid valued thing to do.

268
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,400
In fact, I don't actually know why.

269
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:54,300
We got rid of this, I guess, because we thought it was too slow before

270
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,700
because this was before it was fast enough, I'm not sure.

271
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,700
But I think that that's probably fine because it's pretty fast now.

272
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,900
So I feel like when we reload and I'll go ahead and see about that,

273
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,100
let me make sure that

274
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,500
The handmade config.

275
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,400
I want to make sure to save this.

276
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,100
In fact, you know what I'll do for the time being while we're doing

277
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,500
this.

278
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,300
Let me actually make sure that I take the handmade debug stuff and

279
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,200
make it not write out the handmade config.

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So I'm going to undo that.

281
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
So okay.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,400
Yeah.

283
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Okay, so that's all good.

284
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,600
And the executable reloaded thing, I feel like if we do that with the

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,800
ground chunks, there's really no problem with doing that anymore.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If I just go like that, like they just come back, right?

287
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
So I feel like we won't have too much trouble with that with leaving

288
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:06,900
that on.

289
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,900
So I'll leave that on for now and maybe we can put I will add a debug

290
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,100
switch for it later.

291
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,400
If we if we find that we need it.

292
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
Although you know I guess the point of this is to have as many as

293
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,300
possible so that we think that through.

294
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:25,500
So maybe I'll just say okay there's a debug UI recompute round chunks

295
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,900
on XE change

296
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,300
Something like that.

297
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,500
All right.

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,400
Back to the grep.

299
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,000
there's if 0 again,

300
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,700
Enable us to test weird buffer sizes in the renderer.

301
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,200
That's not something that can actually be updated at that's in the

302
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
platform layer, isn't it?

303
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,700
No, I guess.

304
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,300
It's not

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,300
I guess it's not.

306
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,000
It's something that can just override it.

307
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
So I guess that's fine, too.

308
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:05,400
How to find debug UI test weird draw, buffer size.

309
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,100
and,

310
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,900
What else we got?

311
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Entity type familiar, make spatial queries.

312
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
So I don't know why we don't do this anymore.

313
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,700
This is the thing that makes the familiar follow the hero but I don't

314
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,600
know why we turned it off to be honest with you.

315
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,400
Oops, what happened there?

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,900
mismatched if pair really

317
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Please do tell me where is it?

318
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,500
I like how it doesn't want to tell me where the mismatch if pair is,

319
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,500
it's like, could you give me any more information or you just gonna

320
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,200
like

321
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,000
let that be a mystery.

322
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,400
I guess we'll just make that be mystery.

323
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,800
So what was the last one we did?

324
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,599
It was test weird draw by 4 size.

325
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,300
It's this one.

326
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,500
So if I set this back, does it actually fix it?

327
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,300
No.

328
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
So yeah this is great compiler.

329
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,600
Thanks for absolutely nothing.

330
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Like there's like it literally gave me no information about what that

331
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,600
would be what I would need to know to fix this.

332
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,900
Do you really want me to go through absolutely every one of these to

333
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
make sure that they're actually closed?

334
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,200
Is that what you want me to do?

335
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,400
Because that seems

336
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,500
Well, I got lucky.

337
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
I found it the first time.

338
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,000
All right.

339
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,200
You could have just told me like this was the back, I guess.

340
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Maybe it can't possibly know to think about that.

341
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,700
All right.

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,100
So that's also testing the word buffer size.

343
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,600
All right?

344
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,100
So let's keep going through up and if I guess I could also do it this

345
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,500
way.

346
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,500
I feel like there should be some way to, like, do white space properly

347
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,800
zero,

348
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh, I know I can just Escape it.

349
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,400
See the grep, you see?

350
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,000
And hear how you have if zero there's a space there for some reason,

351
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
fine string interprets that as meaning find either of these two

352
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,300
strings, but I think if I escape it like that, it might actually do

353
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,400
the search for the string, but I don't actually know nope, that turns

354
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,300
out to not be the case.

355
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,700
So don't know how to get it to like, hey man, what you do?

356
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,300
You're fine, stir I actually want you to look

357
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,900
At the whole string.

358
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,100
You must be white.

359
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,100
What is the way?

360
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,300
Let's see.

361
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,900
Literally use of the Medicare direct.

362
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,400
So I feel like / should have worked for that.

363
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,500
You know what I mean?

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,200
But Wild Card any character is dot, so that would work.

365
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,700
Presumably or should have worked.

366
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,600
Maybe I'm using a s n, IL s and I use a search strings literally.

367
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,100
So if I'm using it, literally why can't it do it?

368
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Why can't it do that?

369
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
But why can't it search for that?

370
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,200
That string that's pretty pathetic findstr.

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Let's see.

372
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,700
You space every month stretching, lets you organize prefix with /c for

373
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,800
hello or there.

374
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I think I would I really probably want to do is put a put a c in

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,300
there.

376
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
See if that helps.

377
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,000
Didn't help at all.

378
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,600
You suppose there is a specific IC for civil fines, for a little,

379
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,400
their sisters for hello, or there and file finds her / Seco.

380
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
I got to put a colon

381
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Okay, so it's the different type of search string.

382
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,100
All right, some I should have looked up a long time ago.

383
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,700
I've always just kind of hacked this as I don't know how to use fines

384
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:33,900
for not.

385
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,700
There we go.

386
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,500
Look at that.

387
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,700
Was that so hard?

388
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,100
That was not so hard.

389
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,900
See, debug UI familiar follows zero.

390
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,800
EXO.

391
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
This is the one that I said we're not.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,900
Doing, don't think it works.

393
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is just some code that we aren't using anymore in the profiler.

394
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,200
This is something that shows our chart boundary which you haven't

395
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
really implemented yet so that's fine.

396
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,200
That is a relevant to everyone iaca marks.

397
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,800
Probably something that we want to do specifically as a separate

398
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,200
thing.

399
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Turn this on to see we're in the map, your sampling.

400
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,900
So I guess this is good.

401
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,100
This is debug you.

402
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,200
I show lighting samples.

403
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,200
We would definitely want something like that almost for sure.

404
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
What else we got?

405
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
SSC clamping.

406
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,900
What is this?

407
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,000
What is this?

408
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,400
That's the slowly.

409
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,900
We don't care about that function anymore.

410
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
We don't care about these at all.

411
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,900
What's this Bender?

412
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,300
Grouped output again.

413
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,600
Don't care about these do not care.

414
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,500
Don't care.

415
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,100
Let's see.

416
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
So this

417
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
this is interesting.

418
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,300
This is the camera followed behavior.

419
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,800
I'm not sure if we're really using if that path works anymore but

420
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,300
let's find out use room based camera.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,600
There we go.

422
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,300
So I guess the reason we were doing it is because we don't really have

423
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,800
this information anymore or maybe who is the camera following entity.

424
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,100
And okay, so we have an index, we have, we do know which entity it is,

425
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,300
right?

426
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,600
It's just the entity that we're on at the moment.

427
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,600
So I would assume that that entity

428
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,700
Could have.

429
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,600
Poppy.

430
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
I soon x x.

431
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,400
Why?

432
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Why, of course, the problem is the new camera almost certainly doesn't

433
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,000
have an ABS tile X.

434
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,500
So, that's a bit of a problem as well.

435
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,800
So I don't know that we well yeah, you might as well.

436
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,900
Just play with it a little bit, just to see if we can restore it to

437
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,800
functioning order.

438
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,100
It's been a long time since we touched me this code, but I feel like

439
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,900
we should be able to get the tile side in meters.

440
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,600
Right.

441
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,100
If that I guess, maybe that if that even exists anymore because we

442
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,500
don't really have the concept of typecasting

443
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,500
Giles ever.

444
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,500
So there isn't really any particular need for that to exist.

445
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:44,800
Ever.

446
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,300
And you can kind of see it's almost just ad hoc defined right in

447
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,900
there, right?

448
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,800
And that's the only person who cares about that.

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,500
So at some level we need to decide what this actual camera with was

450
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,800
that would have

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Very little to do with tiles, but I'll just go ahead and assume that

452
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,300
for now, we'll just say, it's 9 meters by 5 meters and we'll look at

453
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,100
that in a second.

454
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,800
See what we actually want to do with it, but then the camera P.

455
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,900
Presumably, we just move the camera by twice, whatever that distance

456
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,200
is, or something like that.

457
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,800
So it would just be whatever the new camera p is right.

458
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,400
It has a world position and the world position should be able.

459
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:29,900
We should be

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
able to call offset on that.

461
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,700
Right?

462
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,200
Because in our world stuff, I remember we had ways of moving things

463
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,300
around like an offset by, right?

464
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
Where are you at?

465
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,300
Change the location raw Center chunk point.

466
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
We can map it to chunk.

467
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Space get World chunk or in same chunk.

468
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Is coming is valid no position.

469
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,200
So there should have been an offset on here not is canonical.

470
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,000
But something else that 0 subtract well, not subtract

471
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,500
Right.

472
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,800
So there should have been a thing and maybe the deal is that they got

473
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,300
moved out into something.

474
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Else.

475
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,700
So I'm going to just go ahead and look, I feel like we should have had

476
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,200
one of those.

477
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,700
Already.

478
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,200
But maybe we just stopped doing that because we always map into this

479
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,900
image and then Mac back out and so it isn't necessary to do.

480
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,200
So I don't actually know

481
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,500
But we'll see.

482
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,800
So looks like map into chunks, space might be the thing.

483
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,100
So map into chunks space is what it is.

484
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,100
You give it a base position in an offset.

485
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,100
All right.

486
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,100
So that's fine.

487
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,400
That's no big deal.

488
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,600
Oops.

489
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,800
All right.

490
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,600
So where was I on that?

491
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,800
I need to find.

492
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,300
I'm, I'm lost.

493
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm lost because we were sort of.

494
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,100
I forget where we were actually working on that particular function.

495
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,100
We were in the, we were in updating the camera, which should be down

496
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,600
here, right?

497
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,700
Yeah.

498
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,100
Here it is.

499
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,900
So we do you room based camera?

500
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,100
We're going to have to update the camera P.

501
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,700
So I think what we would probably say there is we just say, you know,

502
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,100
new camera p is going to be a map into chunks face of whatever the

503
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,300
old.

504
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,000
Poppy was and we know what the world is, right?

505
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,300
Oops, world is.

506
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,700
It's just whatever.

507
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,300
The game state says the world is

508
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,800
And the new camera p is the world position that we're talking about.

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,500
And so the offset for that is just going to be, you know, whatever

510
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,700
that distance is that we think rooms are wide.

511
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,800
So, here we go.

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,200
So yeah, if you're down - 5, then we want to just move you - 10 or

513
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,900
something like that, right?

514
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,900
Can hear.

515
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,400
This is weird - 18, so I don't actually know if that's right but I

516
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,000
just decided to do it anyway because why not?

517
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,900
This point we have so much debug code on.

518
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,400
It's kind of hard to tell what's going on, but let me see if I can

519
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,100
walk up into hey room here and see if it moves.

520
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,300
So the camera does not seem to ever be moving, which is a little

521
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,800
wonky.

522
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
Because I don't feel like that's that many meters.

523
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,700
Its entity p.

524
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,400
X is greater than

525
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,300
Yeah, because the same region centered about the camera.

526
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,900
I feel like that should do it.

527
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,700
Oh, I know, I never actually bothered to capture the result.

528
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,700
That's all it just I just need to save, right?

529
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,200
I just need to save

530
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,400
The result of that.

531
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,500
And then we should be good.

532
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Okay.

533
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,900
Alright, so there we go so we can get room based camera.

534
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Movement happening.

535
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,500
Pretty trivially as well.

536
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Hey, look, The Familiar is following us around again.

537
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
Okay, so we can do you room with camera?

538
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
That's all good.

539
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,100
I'm going to do our grep again now that I actually know how to do it,

540
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,600
right?

541
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,700
So we'll come through here till we get to a new one that we have not

542
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,600
already looked at

543
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,800
Doot-doot-doot drawers.

544
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,100
Bounce Direction drawbitmap.

545
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,400
No no, no and no.

546
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,700
And so here we are.

547
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,100
Okay, so speculative Collide, that's just code that we never really

548
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,800
finished so that's can just stay there.

549
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,100
True.

550
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,200
Stb, to type is not our code that's Sean's code and we're not actually

551
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,400
using it at the moment.

552
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,100
That was just from the day when I showed how to use libraries.

553
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,700
So we don't care about the asset Builder, we don't care about what do

554
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
damage, so, that's everything.

555
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,100
So, that's all the debug stuff that was obviously in there.

556
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,300
I mean, there's probably other stuff that just didn't have, like,

557
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,900
necessarily a pound of 04 it or something like that, but this is a

558
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
pretty good list.

559
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,700
So, if you take a look at all these guys, we can come now kind of see

560
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,500
what we have.

561
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:31,300
And so, what I notice on here is so you'll notice I prefix them all

562
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,200
with debug you.

563
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,500
I and the reason that I did that is because I wanted it to be easy for

564
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,900
us to find them if we needed to find them.

565
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,200
Right?

566
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,400
So, I mean, you know, it's pretty trivial for me to grasp everything

567
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,100
and just say, hey, you know, show me where, all of those things are in

568
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,100
all of our, debug switches, are we now, you know, immediately know

569
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,000
where they occur in handmade hero certainly.

570
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,800
so,

571
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,500
a couple things we can do here.

572
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
First, of all, obviously, we want to know.

573
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,800
All of these, we want to know what all these values are.

574
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,800
So we could present them in a user interface, right?

575
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,300
And we then also need to be able to write them all out.

576
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,100
So if I go in and I'm just going to do the first very basic step of

577
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,500
this.

578
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,800
If I go into handmade debug right, we could imagine listing all of

579
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,100
these guys and having all of these guys be toggleable pretty easily

580
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,700
just by taking exactly what we already did.

581
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,300
You know, with our radial menu.

582
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:29,800
So,

583
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,700
So when we do right config or whatever it is config oops.

584
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,600
So if we were to do this and I'm going to go ahead and save these out,

585
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,600
these guys here into a little comment just so we don't lose them if we

586
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
mess up this code.

587
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,100
So when we write this out really, the problem is that all we were

588
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,000
doing was writing out this one guy, right?

589
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,600
And we need to write out all of these.

590
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,600
So a very trivial First Step that would make it work.

591
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,400
With all of the things that we just listed would be to make some kind

592
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,100
of a list that said, here are all of our debug variables.

593
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,700
This is like a debug variable that we have, okay, and we want to know

594
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,400
like a couple of things about it.

595
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,400
We want to know what its name is, so that we can write it out.

596
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,300
We want to know what its value is.

597
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,500
Right?

598
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,400
And at the moment we really don't need anything else because they're

599
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,100
all boolean's.

600
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,000
But you know, we'd probably want something eventually, right?

601
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,700
That was something like a type in here.

602
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,100
Like that.

603
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,200
So we could at least have in Kira something that says, you know, this

604
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,300
is the type and if later so we can add like integers and floats,

605
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,400
something like that.

606
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,700
And so then it would be relatively easy for us to Define all of these

607
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,200
guys.

608
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,300
In fact, so easy that we could actually just make a macro, I think,

609
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,500
which would be something like, you know, a pound of fine that was

610
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,600
debug variable listing or something.

611
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,300
And then name,

612
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,200
and then when we did debug variable,

613
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
And we make a debug variable list.

614
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,400
Like so it's pretty easy for us to just cut and paste these guys in

615
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:19,900
here.

616
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,100
Like this and then call like, you know, debug variable listing with

617
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,600
the name.

618
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,500
And what that can do is it can first string eyes the name.

619
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
So now we get that string and we'll also will hard-code that to a

620
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:42,800
Boolean for now, like I said, so there's the Boolean we have the name

621
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,100
and then we know the value is just actually the value of the variable.

622
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,300
So we just put the, we just actually use whatever the name is, that

623
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,300
should evaluate to whatever that was trying to whatever.

624
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,400
That that powder fine is actually set to at this time.

625
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,800
so then, all we have to do is convert this list into that, which is

626
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I can use a macro for a pretty trivially that would just be search for

627
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,100
search.

628
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,900
For well, if I could actually type today that would help search for

629
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,500
pound Define right.

630
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Change it to sadiebug variable listing parentheses search for space.

631
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,700
So whatever's, after the name do this comma and kill the rest.

632
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,600
And I think that's really all we need, right?

633
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,800
So now we've got them all kind of prettied up.

634
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,900
Up and ready to go.

635
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,600
So that point.

636
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,500
Now, if we want to write things out, we can actually write things out

637
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,600
in a list, write the kind of goes along

638
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,100
So if I want to kind of stream this guy out into the file in a more

639
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,800
coherent fashion, you can kind of imagine how I might do it.

640
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,100
Right?

641
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
I do something like this where that is where we're starting.

642
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:00,000
We go in a loop and we say, for, you know, debug variable index equals

643
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,300
zero, debug variable index equals start less than or a count of the

644
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,400
debug variable list.

645
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:11,000
For each one of those, we just go ahead and grab debug variable list.

646
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Plus, we bug variable index.

647
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,300
And that's our debug variable.

648
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,400
So when we get one of those variables now we don't have to guess about

649
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,199
these things.

650
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,300
Instead of you do use debug camera.

651
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,000
I can just say whatever the vars value is is what we're going to print

652
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,300
out in the percent D and then I can also say that whatever its name is

653
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,400
actually comes from the name that's stored in there like that and now

654
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:43,300
we are could put them all out after I print it instead of doing Temp

655
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,400
and size of temp.

656
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,000
I can do instead.

657
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,600
It's a like size of temp - at and that at.

658
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,800
So I just I just kind of go through as I go and I just increment at to

659
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,700
kind of right through the string and then when I get to the very end

660
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,300
again all I have to do is say well the size that I'm going to write

661
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,300
out to the handmade config file is just going to be, however, big temp

662
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,000
was - however much however far I went

663
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,400
That's not right, sorry, it's just how ever much at is minus the base

664
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:17,800
of temp.

665
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,900
So any, what's between the start of the buffer and what's where I am

666
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
where I ended up, right?

667
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,100
So that should do it, I would think.

668
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh, and that's a little sorry, that's brains little level today.

669
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,300
Obviously, we need to advance.

670
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
We need to start where we're temp, is Advanced by the size of its we

671
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,200
get to the end and then subtract add a way which that's how much room

672
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,800
we have left.

673
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,400
Left to right at any given time.

674
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay, so cannot convert parameter or argument 32, size T argument 3?

675
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,500
Wait, shouldn't argument 3 be a string?

676
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:11,100
I'm Casey is confused by that a little bit, a little bit.

677
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,400
We know that this will not be big so we can cast to a 32-bit for

678
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,600
fixing that, but I don't understand why it would be 2y.

679
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,300
It's to size T's SN printf underscore s takes to size tease.

680
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,600
Does it really?

681
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,600
It doesn't anywhere else.

682
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,100
Right.

683
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,200
It just takes the pointer to the text buffer which I did right there.

684
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,000
Then the size.

685
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,500
Which is that does this just need to be cast to something else.

686
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,500
Cannot convert argument three from constant care, 22 to size t.

687
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:13,500
So, let's see, first our end is equal to 10 plus size of temp, right?

688
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,600
That should work.

689
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,700
Temp.

690
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,000
In this case is the base pointer.

691
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,600
So the end - at is how much space there should be remaining.

692
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,100
And that is what I would like to call this with.

693
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,900
So we're on Earth, it's getting the fact that that takes a care star

694
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
to size, teas.

695
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,900
And then a constant care star.

696
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,800
I don't know.

697
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,500
So, I would like to know why, in some places of our code seems to want

698
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
that in others, it doesn't.

699
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,400
It wants the buffer, which I gave it the size of the buffer.

700
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,000
Then it takes a count.

701
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,000
What is that count?

702
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,400
What does that count even for?

703
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,200
Have you been calling this wrong maximum to store Source location, the

704
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,800
size of storage location for output.

705
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,800
Interesting.

706
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,700
So, how did that not trigger here?

707
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Because we don't pass it that here, right?

708
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,800
It's a little weird.

709
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,600
that we've never had to pass it before and all of a sudden wants to

710
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,000
know,

711
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,800
am I the only one who's kind of going crazy?

712
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,600
Maybe.

713
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,800
So here is another version of it, right?

714
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:57,200
In s n, printfs care, buffer size, size t, count concert care format.

715
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,800
And so, for some reason, it doesn't seem to have

716
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,500
That.

717
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,100
Right?

718
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,300
It only is it's only looking at these as options.

719
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,300
It's not considering this an option for whatever reason and I don't

720
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,300
actually know what that reason is.

721
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,200
At all.

722
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,200
If that makes any sense.

723
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,300
Totally perplexed by that.

724
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:31,400
Hmm, I guess it's because this is just a regular pointer maybe.

725
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,500
But what I can say is that we don't care because we could pass this

726
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,000
thing twice, and that would be fine.

727
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,400
Right, I don't know.

728
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,600
Well, let's go ahead and go into here and actually see what's going on

729
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,700
because I don't really care.

730
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,300
But this is one of the reasons, like I say, I never use libraries on

731
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,500
purpose, it's because I hate them and I never know why they make the

732
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,900
decisions that they do and things like that, or weird.

733
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,400
So, let's go ahead and here and step in

734
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,800
So here is temp our temp buffer.

735
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,100
And we are going to start writing to it.

736
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,500
So there we've written our first thing to it.

737
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,600
You can see we wrote the use debug camera which is correct.

738
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Is the first one we Loop through?

739
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,900
Now, we write another one.

740
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,300
And, as you can see, we wrote that one in here now.

741
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,000
So now we've got wi ground, chuck out lines and presumably we can then

742
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,200
go all the way to the end.

743
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,100
It just look and see what it wrote out.

744
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,000
And it looks like it wrote out all of our thing, all of our variables.

745
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,200
So we can go ahead and let that right itself to a file.

746
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:44,300
So now, if we take a look here at the actual config file and reload,

747
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,000
it, it should look exactly the way it does now, and it does, so, no

748
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,300
change.

749
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,000
So, that's perfect.

750
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That's what we want.

751
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,300
And so we're good to go.

752
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,300
So, now we actually are rewriting all of our config file variables

753
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:55,900
properly.

754
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,600
Which also means if we want to start toggling them, we can do that as

755
00:40:59,600 --> 00:40:59,800
well.

756
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,900
So instead of doing menu items here, like, we were, what I could do is

757
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,800
say, instead of using menu items, let's use debug variables.

758
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,900
So in here we'll just say OK The Rake out to the debug variable list

759
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,100
is what we'll use instead of the menu items.

760
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Something like that.

761
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,300
Makes makes good sense, right?

762
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,900
And then the carts Tara startx could just be from debug variable list

763
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,700
and grab the name.

764
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,800
Right.

765
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,700
Oops.

766
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,200
Variable list.

767
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,800
So that seems fair, right?

768
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,000
That seems like a that seems like a fair thing to do.

769
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,800
So now we'll have that many of them.

770
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,700
So if I ran it I should now have.

771
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,700
If I right click, I should have just a ton of these things, right?

772
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,100
I have a ton of these, these different things that we have in there

773
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,700
and whichever one, I click.

774
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,700
Now what I would like to do is make it.

775
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,000
So whichever one I click is the one that actually gets toggled.

776
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,800
And again that's also probably pretty darn

777
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,700
The for me to do, all I would have to do is when we look at the hot

778
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:11,000
menu index that comes back assuming that the hot menu index is less

779
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,200
than the array count of the debug variable list.

780
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,000
Meaning, it was like a valid pick or whatever.

781
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,400
All I would have to do is say, okay, if

782
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,500
if the the mouse button was released,

783
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,900
I know that the hot menu index got selected.

784
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,600
So the debug variable lists at that entry I want to set its value

785
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,500
equal want to toggle its value, right?

786
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,300
So that toggles, that value.

787
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,500
and now, when I rewrite it,

788
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,300
It will get Rewritten with the new value on it right again.

789
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,700
Really, really simple stuff here.

790
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Nothing nothing kind of crazy that I'm doing is very very basic

791
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,300
So now our radial menu will actually be wired up.

792
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,400
Right at least in theory.

793
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,400
So if I click on debug use camera and it recompiles I should now get

794
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,200
back my regular camera which I did if I switch to using say what's the

795
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,200
the weird buffer size test, very buffer size the sky, I can go back to

796
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,500
full screen, right?

797
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,900
And so now I have the ability to literally change any of the variables

798
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,800
that I want to just buy like switching them directly that way, right?

799
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,300
If I'm tired of the room.

800
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,200
It's camera.

801
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,400
I can switch that and and so on, and then it'll do the recompile and

802
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,600
switch and again.

803
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,400
So now,

804
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,600
It's a little, it's not quite as nice as if the variables were

805
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,900
actually directly in the program, in the sense that it does have to do

806
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,400
the recompilation, but it's vastly more powerful because we can

807
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,500
actually insert things that are extremely costly and turn them on and

808
00:43:59,500 --> 00:43:59,800
off.

809
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
And it's not a problem, because it doesn't, we don't have to put in

810
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,300
branches, that might affect our performance or anything else.

811
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,000
Like that doesn't actually have to happen.

812
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,100
We can also just recompile drastically different stuff.

813
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,200
We can switch out whole functions that were calling if we want to

814
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
I pretty much for free, right?

815
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,000
So anything that might affect the the whole structure of the program,

816
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,600
like an inline function, we could switch the witch in line which

817
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,200
version of an inline function, we were using and it would cost nothing

818
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,800
to do that, right?

819
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,900
Even in release mode, we would get the correct performance in both

820
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,700
cases, which is kind of awesome if you ask me.

821
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
And again, that's something I've ever done before.

822
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,300
And I'm not sure necessarily why I just never tried it.

823
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,100
So anyway yet you know, you can switch all these off.

824
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
But now, so now we kind of have a pretty I want.

825
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,600
I think maybe the particle Fountain is getting a little bit ridiculous

826
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,300
at this point.

827
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,600
I think, at least we want Turn Off the Grid because I can't see

828
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:58,900
anything.

829
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,800
Will that grids on there?

830
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,400
Right.

831
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,100
Alright, so now we're totally good to go.

832
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,100
And so now I would say that's like a pretty obviously nice thing to do

833
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:17,500
but there is a little bit of annoyance there, a very tiny like a very

834
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,300
tiny bit of annoyance there, I guess.

835
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,100
But a bit nonetheless which is that we have to I mean obviously we

836
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,800
want to clean up the UI because this is awful.

837
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,000
So we want to like I was planning on

838
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,800
I'm doing I see we want to push forward on the UI front but there is

839
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,900
one thing in here.

840
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,900
That's also probably I would say something to fit to think about which

841
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,500
is just the steps you have to go through to actually get into a

842
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,300
situation where something is wired up to the UI in that way, right?

843
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,400
And the answer there is that.

844
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:59,200
Every time I want to do this now I have to go add like if I wanted to

845
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,600
make a new one of these.

846
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,300
So I mean handmade that's either P or something like this.

847
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,600
And I want to make a new thing like something that just may be okay.

848
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,100
Like I don't know it it stops drawing familiars altogether or

849
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,700
something.

850
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,200
So they're just like a pound of 0 that happens in here.

851
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,700
What I want to be able to do is I want to be able to go debug you.

852
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:22,900
I like don't know, familiar, drawers or whatever.

853
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:23,600
Like that.

854
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,800
I'd like to be able to do that and just be done and I don't really

855
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,200
want to have to go in here and add the debug variable listening.

856
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,800
Necessarily right that seems like maybe it's kind of a little bit

857
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,200
annoying.

858
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,500
Now it's only a little bit annoying certainly.

859
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,800
So it's not like there's a huge deal there, but that is something that

860
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,500
might, you know, if I was going to go Whole Hog, I would probably make

861
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,000
something that just parses the file looking for these guys and updates

862
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,600
them here, right?

863
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,600
So, that I wouldn't have to do that manually.

864
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,000
It just be like you do it and it's done.

865
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,700
I feel like that might be going a little bit overboard.

866
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
Just a little, just a little.

867
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,100
so what I might do instead,

868
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,200
it's just make sure this is in a pretty obvious place, right?

869
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,000
So I might say, okay, maybe this goes like up here or something.

870
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,500
Somewhere where it's really easy to know where it is.

871
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,700
Something like that.

872
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,900
Yeah, maybe I'll even put it in a separate file.

873
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,800
So maybe these guys stay here but this kind of goes in a separate

874
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,100
file.

875
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,800
So there's handmade debug variables dot h and there it is.

876
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,000
Something like that.

877
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,700
And then in here, we just include it.

878
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:54,700
And that way, I guess that's really not too bad, right?

879
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,600
That's something that I'm okay with.

880
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,800
I'll just update that anytime we want to add something and offer.

881
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,400
Yeah, pretty straightforward.

882
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,600
So that's really all that I want to do there.

883
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,600
I'll just I have a few minutes left.

884
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:13,600
So while I'm I don't want to start on some new UI Elements, which is

885
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,600
really what we need to start doing.

886
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,800
Like, figure out how that screen is going to look.

887
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,600
So we can fix, you know, finish our radial menu and finish how so the

888
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,400
UI elements going to go.

889
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,200
So we want to play with that.

890
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,300
But well do in the meantime is let me just finish a couple little

891
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,200
things about the radial menu that we probably want to fix.

892
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,000
So if we take a look at the the driving, the debug menu here, then

893
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,900
what happens in the debug menu stuff is, there's no way right now,

894
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,100
there's two things that are kind of annoying.

895
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,700
There's no way right now not to select something because there's no

896
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,000
concept of like like an inner ring where it just never actually

897
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:50,700
triggers.

898
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,000
So what I'd like to do is make sure that the distance between so like

899
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,700
best distance squared or something.

900
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:01,300
What I'd like to do is say, I'm not going to use this result.

901
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,700
this right here where we set the hot menu index,

902
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,600
I'm not going to use that result.

903
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,500
I'm going to set it.

904
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,900
The hot menu index back to array count, debug variable list.

905
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,700
So the null value, I'm not going to use it unless the actual length

906
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:30,700
squared of the place where the mouse is - the place where the radial

907
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,800
menu is centered.

908
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,400
So the menu radius

909
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,000
If that length is less than some like the radius of the menu of the

910
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,300
menu radius or something.

911
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,700
Oops, I meant, sorry, I meant menu, I want the actual menu position.

912
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,000
Want me to pee

913
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,300
So if the user hasn't moved like out of the menu radius into clearly

914
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,300
into a Zone, then I don't want to count it, right?

915
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,700
Because that that would be bad.

916
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,500
So I I'm going to have that and then I'm also would like to indicate

917
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,800
whether these things are set or not might be nice.

918
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,800
So what we could do is say, you know, we've got the item color here

919
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,400
and we're setting it to white, but we could do something pretty

920
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,000
trivial and set it to like you know, gray or something, right?

921
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,300
We could just do that.

922
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,700
and so, since we know the debug variable,

923
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,300
We know all the information about it then given the fact that we know

924
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,300
the information about it like what its value is not just what its name

925
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:34,800
is.

926
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,300
Then not only can we get the text out of it?

927
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,600
We can also get what it's setting is right now.

928
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,600
So we can just use its value and see whether the value indicates what

929
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,000
the drawing, you know, whether the things should be highlighted or

930
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,100
not, right?

931
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,700
Oops, I should probably get rid of that.

932
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,000
Little example code, I added there, sorry about that.

933
00:50:59,400 --> 00:50:59,800
That

934
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay, let's try that again.

935
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,300
And take a look.

936
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:15,300
So now you can kind of see that the stuff is is you know, it looks

937
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,300
like I can't.

938
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,300
I've got it the wrong way around.

939
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,900
I've got the wrong way round.

940
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,100
Sorry I meant greater than the menu radius.

941
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,500
I wanted to make sure you move outside of it.

942
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,800
Not not that you can't move outside of it my bad.

943
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,900
Alright, so now, I think we're good.

944
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,900
Right now, you can kind of Select from the radial menu.

945
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,700
You can see what's on and what's off.

946
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,700
So if I don't want my ground chunks to recompute, for example, I just

947
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,400
turned them off and now they won't work computer anymore and that's

948
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,600
fine, right?

949
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,500
And the little familiar is following us around but maybe I don't want

950
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,000
the familiar to follow us around anymore.

951
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,400
So I just turn off familiar fellows hero and now he stays where he is.

952
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,800
Right.

953
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,200
And so again, I think we're all good.

954
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,600
I think everything is working the way that I would like it to work

955
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,000
now.

956
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,700
And now we can access our debug code again.

957
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,900
So we can like zoom out if you want to and that sort of thing.

958
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:11,800
The only thing I'm not happy about the only thing that doesn't fill me

959
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:20,100
with Glee so much is the fact that there's that, the compilation time

960
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,100
is a little slow right, that turnaround time.

961
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,400
And so, we can do a little bit about that, right?

962
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,600
Like, the asset processor, we don't need to compile, right?

963
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,900
So in the build-up batch file, we can speed up our build a little bit

964
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,700
by.

965
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,100
Can we both live with both with 1xe?

966
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,600
I don't even know what that means anymore.

967
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,400
We got to do that.

968
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,200
I do not even know.

969
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,800
So I could turn off the acid Builder, right?

970
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:53,900
And that compiles, a little bit faster and I could also turn off me.

971
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,300
Recompiling the win32 code, right?

972
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,600
So you know, if that was gone the compiles a little faster but that

973
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,200
doesn't actually change our refresh time.

974
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,300
I don't think but but not compiling the asset Builder you know, might

975
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:08,800
help.

976
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
So maybe that's something.

977
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,100
We should just leave off for now and see what that gets us for

978
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,900
compile-time turn around, so use you but camera that's pretty fast.

979
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,900
It's not as fast as I would like it, but it's not it's not too bad,

980
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:20,900
right?

981
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,000
So that's pretty good.

982
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,300
So I think that's where I'll leave it for today.

983
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,900
All right, let's go ahead and go to the Q&A.

984
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,300
And yeah, if you have questions about what we did today, please feel

985
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,000
free to ask them, preface them with a Q&A:.

986
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,900
So I can see them and I will answer them, but I think we're basically

987
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,000
where we want to be now with this.

988
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,700
So now I think I can, I can go ahead and finish out, you know, or at

989
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,800
least make a more significant progress on what we want the UI to be.

990
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,800
Now we have an actual, some actual use cases that we can look at here.

991
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,400
I don't know, like one thing that we could do in addition, just as

992
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,600
another example, if we wanted to add another type in here and maybe

993
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,700
I'll just add it to do for.

994
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,300
This will be something to do tomorrow.

995
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,500
Is in our debug variables, I could put it to do, you know, add the

996
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,700
distance for the debug camera.

997
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,400
So we have a float example, right?

998
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:35,800
Or maybe like the parameterize, the fountain, I don't know.

999
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,400
Something like that.

1000
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,100
Particle fountain.

1001
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,000
Flutter falter.

1002
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,900
I don't understand why a single if statement would be expensive, if we

1003
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,200
do it at runtime, can you give an example?

1004
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,000
Sure, I can give an example.

1005
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Let's take a look.

1006
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,200
So let's let's, let's construct a concrete example.

1007
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,300
And we actually, I guess we actually have the tools to do this to some

1008
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,800
degree now as well.

1009
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,100
So, here we are in our game.

1010
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,800
And here is the game running.

1011
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,300
And as you can see, we're running our software.

1012
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,500
Under and it's pretty darn Zippy, right?

1013
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,900
It's got a real nice frame rate.

1014
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
Everything's going fine.

1015
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,300
And you know what, I kind of need one thing.

1016
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:29,400
I also probably want to do here is I'm going to need some way to.

1017
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
I don't part of the grid.

1018
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,200
I'm going to need some way to turn on the profiler as well right.

1019
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,200
Oh, well I guess I don't because we actually have a thing up here.

1020
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,300
You can see our frame times, they're down in like the, they're like

1021
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,800
basically 60 frames a second.

1022
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,300
Almost.

1023
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,900
Just most of the time and this is in debug mode.

1024
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,000
So it right.

1025
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,500
Okay, so now let's go ahead and say that, you know, let's take a look

1026
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,600
at our render here.

1027
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,100
Here is handmade optimized, right?

1028
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,900
Here's draw a rectangle quickly and supposed gear.

1029
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,800
We want to do something where we've got a couple different code paths

1030
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,400
for stuff.

1031
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,900
Right, that have to happen.

1032
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,700
So what we want to do is we want to say like okay when we do, when we

1033
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,300
convert the texture from srgb to linear something like this, we want

1034
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,300
to have a way of doing an, if on

1035
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,300
That's going to come on in here, right?

1036
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,600
So we're going to do this two different ways, right?

1037
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,400
Something like that.

1038
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,200
Of course, I guess.

1039
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,200
Well you know what, I'll just do it this way.

1040
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,900
I guess I just need some things in here.

1041
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,400
So I'm going to need some sound of static variable up here that I'm

1042
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,200
going to switch on, right?

1043
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,300
Because it's debug code.

1044
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,700
So I'm going to need a static.

1045
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:54,200
Like do you know thing test 1

1046
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,300
And so, let's go ahead and have things test one.

1047
00:56:59,300 --> 00:56:59,800
It's off.

1048
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,800
So it won't do anything, which is the case we're interested in.

1049
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,600
And then I'm just going to go ahead and put that in there, right?

1050
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,900
so if thing test what happens, then we're going to recompute the

1051
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,100
values of all of these things like so

1052
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:14,900
There we go.

1053
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,300
And then, I'm just going to sort of start to see what happens if I

1054
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,200
insert that.

1055
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,400
Now, the first thing you'll notice is our frame rates already dropped

1056
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,600
considerably, right?

1057
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,500
It used to be at 17 now, it's a 20.

1058
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,500
Okay, so now I'm going to start adding some more of these in there.

1059
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,700
Just to see what happens.

1060
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,500
Right.

1061
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,200
And I suspect, I don't actually know that they'll be that much of a

1062
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,700
difference that happens if I don't actually involve some other

1063
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,200
variables but you know will start will spam in another set for down

1064
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,100
here, right?

1065
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,000
So maybe like in here.

1066
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:50,000
Or maybe when I do the load, like for up here when I do the fetches or

1067
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,600
something like that, where we do Doucette EP is maybe what I'll do

1068
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:57,500
here is I'll just do a second set of those and I'll test them off of a

1069
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,300
different variable.

1070
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:00,600
Do the thing.

1071
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,100
Put it, I call it.

1072
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,100
Don't remember.

1073
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,400
Ping test 1.

1074
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,400
Princess Leia.

1075
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:20,700
All right.

1076
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,500
So these are all branching off the same thing test.

1077
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:27,900
Right.

1078
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,000
And there we go.

1079
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,900
So now let's make them Branch off one for each patch.

1080
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,900
Like we would normally do.

1081
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,800
So if we want to be able to turn these on and off right then, each one

1082
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,100
of these is going to be a different thing test.

1083
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,100
So we would have an array of these, something like this, where we have

1084
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:49,000
thing test123, for that sort of thing, right?

1085
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,500
So, here's the thing test to just three.

1086
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,400
Thank us for just five to six.

1087
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:00,900
Okay.

1088
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,400
all right, so as far as I can tell

1089
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,000
I guess that didn't actually do too much to hurt us.

1090
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,200
I would have expected.

1091
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,500
I mean it is a little bit but it's not as bad as I would have thought

1092
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,200
I would have thought that adding more things to test on since it has

1093
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,300
to do more checks.

1094
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,000
Would have been a little bit bad, but I guess those particular ones

1095
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,900
don't seem to actually have too much of effect on things I guess.

1096
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,500
so that particular case, I would say,

1097
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,300
Doesn't seem to be too bad.

1098
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,600
I don't know that you'd want to do any tests in here, but if you're

1099
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,300
going to do one test, it looks like you can do more as looking good.

1100
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,200
Looks like, can maybe do as many as you want.

1101
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,700
Once you're doing some, if that makes sense.

1102
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,300
But maybe not, we'll see.

1103
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,900
So that's thing one.

1104
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,400
Okay, so

1105
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,900
Let's take a look here, so if I then go and do something a little bit

1106
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,100
more drastic so suppose that I wanted to do something like this.

1107
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:16,700
Right.

1108
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,400
Because again, like doing a test for one, if is not really the part

1109
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,700
that is the most problematic, I would think.

1110
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,500
So the part that we're interest me a little bit more is, let's say, we

1111
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,600
have something fairly drastic like turning on ayaka or something like

1112
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,500
that, right.

1113
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,500
That we wanted to be able to do, I don't know that that's a

1114
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:39,900
particularly good example because I suppose, you know, that's, that's

1115
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,600
actually kind of just markers that are in the code.

1116
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,000
So I guess we don't really care about that.

1117
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,500
Maybe adding more timers in there, let's say.

1118
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:55,000
Might be more of a thing or maybe using a different set, a different

1119
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
function path.

1120
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,400
I'm thinking would be something like I'm thinking more about, and

1121
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,500
maybe I'm just being unrealistic about the time.

1122
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,900
The number of times, I might care about this but, you know, I'm

1123
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,600
thinking about something where it's like, okay something that's used

1124
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:10,900
everywhere.

1125
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:16,200
Like, I am doing something like the the subtract operator or something

1126
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,500
for my, you know, for my multiplier.

1127
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,000
And I want to do something really expensive in there, right?

1128
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,800
So, I want to do an, if in there on a static, I feel like that's the

1129
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,300
kind of thing that would, you know, that I would want this sort of

1130
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:31,900
thing for.

1131
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,200
So, if I had static, I got rid of it, I didn't say get rid of test at

1132
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,100
night, but I didn't,

1133
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,800
I feel like that is the sort of thing that I also would want it for.

1134
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,300
So you know, I don't know what it would do in here.

1135
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:57,800
Just some stuff.

1136
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,300
Who knows what do we do?

1137
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,600
But basically like things like that are more what I'm worried about

1138
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,600
and I don't know like maybe they're unrealistic, maybe we'd never do

1139
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,300
one that costs enough.

1140
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,600
Maybe the branch predictions just always good enough and it wouldn't

1141
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,300
really care.

1142
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,600
You know, I don't know.

1143
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,800
And so we can do is just wrap them around as long as we wrap them with

1144
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,500
a regular, if we'll be safe,

1145
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,800
I'm not sure I'd have to think about whether I can think of a concrete

1146
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,600
case for these, but that was the thing that was more thinking about if

1147
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,900
I want to insert something specifically into the code that could have

1148
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,600
some kind of effect on it one way or the other that I'm worried about.

1149
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,300
I now don't have to worry about it anymore.

1150
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,700
So I don't have to worry about changing the performance criteria of

1151
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:50,000
the code in the cases, where, you know, I in the cases where I'm

1152
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,300
compiling debug stuff in

1153
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:56,100
I know it's exactly the same code as what I'll ship, you know, except

1154
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,900
for just the things that I turn on.

1155
01:02:59,300 --> 01:02:59,800
So, I don't know.

1156
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,700
But it would be interesting to know.

1157
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,100
It might be that, you know, if you don't ever want to touch the inner

1158
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:08,700
loop of the pixel code or something with anything weird.

1159
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:10,700
And you.

1160
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:15,800
And like and you really can just have 0 as long as you have predicted

1161
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,800
branches in here, the processor Just Hits it and it's fine.

1162
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:23,400
Then it may be that there's no real, super good reason that you have

1163
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:27,400
to be able to be able to do it at compile time.

1164
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:30,000
But again, yeah, I'd like to test it.

1165
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,800
I'd like to know and maybe as we go through on a major will be able to

1166
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,300
find out.

1167
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:39,800
Like, we'll see if we ever use things in a way that we could then go

1168
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,100
oh wait, that might be interesting to see if that would have been a

1169
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,800
problem.

1170
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:46,500
In terms of changing how things were performing.

1171
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,400
Oh, you know what?

1172
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,600
I forgot to do though to that was the bad test.

1173
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,100
I forgot to change to release mode.

1174
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,700
So that was kind of stupid actually.

1175
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,700
So in release mode where things are crazy, fast running

1176
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,400
Let me, let me double check to see what happens in release mode.

1177
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,400
If I do some of these tests again.

1178
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,000
So it still doesn't look too bad.

1179
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,200
It looks like it's okay.

1180
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,400
With that, for the most part.

1181
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,000
It does not look like it hurts.

1182
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:31,600
It too much.

1183
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,300
I mean, again, it may be hurts a little, but it doesn't hurt.

1184
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,100
It doesn't hurt it.

1185
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:40,000
Certainly to any degree, that, that you would probably be too paranoid

1186
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,600
about it.

1187
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Like, it would have to be very specifically rare cases where you're

1188
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:50,300
like, oh my God, I have to, you know, I'm really worried about about

1189
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,100
what's happening.

1190
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,500
However, you know.

1191
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,200
So here's another thing, I would say though,

1192
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,300
Even in that case.

1193
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,300
So when you're working on performance stuff, they're like, what can we

1194
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,200
think about this?

1195
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,400
There'd be no way for us to test.

1196
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,900
If mob, mask epi8 really worked with a toggle without this, though,

1197
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,100
right?

1198
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,100
Oh whoops, that didn't actually recompile.

1199
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,300
All right, let me try that again.

1200
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,700
I'm being too sloppy here.

1201
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,900
God, I hate you Max's on do.

1202
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's so stupid.

1203
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:39,700
like, I just

1204
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,400
Revert revert, the file.

1205
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,100
Okay, there we go.

1206
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,800
So all of those guys are in there.

1207
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,400
Get rid of thing, test.

1208
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,800
Recompile.

1209
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:02,900
Okay.

1210
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:04,600
Now.

1211
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,400
You can see the frame rates, actually pretty variable there.

1212
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,600
It's down, and kind of the noise.

1213
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,000
So it's a little bit hard to really do a comparison.

1214
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,400
We'd have to do something a little bit more if we wanted to do a fair

1215
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,900
test we'd have to do something a little more straightforward Or

1216
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,600
Meticulous.

1217
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,300
I should say, right?

1218
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,100
so now, if I remove these,

1219
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:41,100
Yeah.

1220
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:45,300
I mean I would say that that does look like it got about a millisecond

1221
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,900
faster potentially but it's not a fair test.

1222
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,600
I mean looking at a number that's fluctuating that wildly is not

1223
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,200
really fair.

1224
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,000
So, I don't know.

1225
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,500
I don't know.

1226
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,200
Let's try it again and see if that's repeatable.

1227
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,800
Yeah, I mean it definitely feels like it does have a serious effect

1228
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,100
there.

1229
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,300
Now whether that has anything to do with the branches though, I don't

1230
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:13,400
know.

1231
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,300
Because one of the things about performance, it's that's annoying.

1232
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,800
As like, your code alignment, actually affects it, right?

1233
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,900
So, it could be that what I'm doing, actually, has nothing to do with,

1234
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,200
with the with anything, other than it's just a different code,

1235
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,900
alignment produces, a different speed.

1236
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:30,300
So, again, you'd have to really meticulous to say, but I guess now

1237
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,800
that I think about it, when you're compiling an Optimizer does, look

1238
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,600
like the differences is actually there.

1239
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:41,200
So so I guess I stand by my original statement.

1240
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,300
I think you do kind of want this so that you know that when you're

1241
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,800
working on perf stuff, you can still use all your debug things and

1242
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,200
they work in a good way.

1243
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,300
Why are we adding b32 comment in the config file.

1244
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,200
So the answer the answer there is

1245
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:08,200
That that was because I thought we would need that for information

1246
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,600
purposes, but we don't actually, because since I decided it was okay

1247
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,200
to keep it here.

1248
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,300
We could just come out with that.

1249
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,700
Markup can go in here later if we want to.

1250
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,300
So it's totally fine for us to get rid of the, of the be 32 now and we

1251
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:23,200
could always add it back in.

1252
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,000
Obviously, if we end up, determining that that's important, right?

1253
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:28,300
So yeah.

1254
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,200
Can you toggle the debug options while looping?

1255
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,399
Yeah.

1256
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,100
You can.

1257
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:40,600
I would think we make sure I'm all rebuilt here.

1258
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,300
Okay.

1259
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,100
I would think I can't think of any reason why they would be a problem

1260
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:46,800
with that.

1261
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,899
So if I wanted to do that, I just go like this.

1262
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:59,399
Oh, so here's the thing though.

1263
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,399
What we will have to do if we want to access debug features during

1264
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,500
looping is we will have to make it so that the input for the mouse

1265
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:13,399
passes through right which is actually pretty easy for us to do

1266
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,100
because the mouse is separate.

1267
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But if you look

1268
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,200
Right.

1269
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,100
At what happens with the mouse.

1270
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,000
You know, the mouse the new input Mouse stuff happens here, right?

1271
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,200
That's all doing.

1272
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,000
It's a little thing.

1273
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:38,600
But then when we get down here, we do the input playback, it will romp

1274
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,200
over it.

1275
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,600
You know what I'm saying?

1276
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,100
So what we would want to do there is we want to do something like

1277
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,600
this, where we'd say, okay, you know, we want to let the mouse go

1278
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,000
through so that debug editing is not recorded, its it happens,

1279
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,100
At the time always it's not ever played back.

1280
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,900
And so if you wanted to do that, we would have to do something like

1281
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:02,200
this.

1282
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Where we said like game input temp, equals new input.

1283
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:15,000
you know, new input Mouse buttons and if we have a copy struct, so but

1284
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:18,400
Mouse x equals temp mousex

1285
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,200
Y, z, z y.

1286
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,900
And then yeah.

1287
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,700
Here we would just copy that in.

1288
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,100
I don't know if we have a copy.

1289
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,400
We do.

1290
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,900
So we do something like that.

1291
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,900
For now I'll just actually do it.

1292
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,000
I don't really want to deal with the copy situation.

1293
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,500
I really wish she would just let you do it.

1294
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,100
There's I do not understand.

1295
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,400
No idea why they don't let you do that.

1296
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,500
It's the dumbest thing that you can't just do it but of course,

1297
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:56,500
usually can.

1298
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,400
Okay, so if I go ahead and do this, oops,

1299
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,900
And then fix the copy.

1300
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,300
So this has to be, you know,

1301
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,000
something like this.

1302
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,900
For no darn reason.

1303
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,900
So now I think that would allow us to pass the mouse through.

1304
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,300
So, you know, this stuff.

1305
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,600
Now in theory, oops,

1306
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,000
This stuff here in theory.

1307
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,300
And I should do as well.

1308
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,000
Just until we actually do that you I I'd like to make that debug menu

1309
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,200
a little bigger radius.

1310
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,100
400.

1311
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,500
You know what that also should be the square because we're taking the

1312
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,000
length squared and we should compare it against the menus squared.

1313
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,800
But that's that's for tomorrow.

1314
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,900
So there's our actual UI stuff, right?

1315
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,600
Okay, so if I go ahead and get the dude in here and set the looping

1316
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:31,600
So now I'm looping and now I can get the UI happening on top, so I

1317
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,200
think I should be able to do something like if I wanted to change the

1318
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,400
ground checkerboards.

1319
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,500
I think it just works and yeah, there it is.

1320
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,500
So that's fine.

1321
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,200
And I can do whatever else I want.

1322
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,900
So I can, I can make the familiar follow the hero and there he goes,

1323
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,200
right?

1324
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,100
I can.

1325
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:57,700
Change which way were drawn.

1326
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,500
You know.

1327
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,900
So yeah, so that all works.

1328
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,400
You should add an optimization switch to the you.

1329
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:14,200
I at some point, you know, that is a really, really good idea.

1330
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:28,300
So that's such a good idea that I feel like we almost want to make it

1331
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,300
kind of a little more formalized in the sense that like if we switch

1332
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,500
to using the pragma on off method and we got that working, we could

1333
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:41,900
actually have debug switches that turn on and off optimizations in

1334
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:43,400
different parts of the code.

1335
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,700
So when we need to debug something, we just turn off the optimization,

1336
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,200
just on that piece.

1337
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,200
Let's see.

1338
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,900
Wouldn't - oh, to optimize the dead branches out?

1339
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,500
Well, they're not dead though.

1340
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,600
I assume I assume it didn't know that they were dead because they were

1341
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,400
static variables.

1342
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,100
So those variables could have been changed, right?

1343
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,500
I suppose I should have made them volatile.

1344
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,400
That would have been the way to make, make sure it knew it didn't do

1345
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,500
that, I guess but

1346
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,500
Engineer.

1347
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,400
Oh, could you have an option to either recompile or simply toggle?

1348
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,800
If it seems like most of the time you would use the regular.

1349
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,200
If so the changes instantaneous but an extreme cases, you could

1350
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,300
easily, just do the recompile option.

1351
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,900
So I don't know how I would do that is the only problem.

1352
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:20,600
So I think if you wanted to do that, I'm trying to think.

1353
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,800
But I suspect that the only way you could do that is if you use some

1354
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:30,800
kind of a notch, I can't think of how you would make it.

1355
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,600
So you could switch between them like just free free switch.

1356
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:38,400
Right.

1357
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,300
Because so

1358
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,100
You can trap a pound if inside another macro.

1359
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,300
So you're pretty much stuck doing this.

1360
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,300
And so you'd have to do something like this.

1361
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,900
You have to double wrap everything.

1362
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,300
You know.

1363
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
Which seems super sucky.

1364
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,600
So, I can't think of a fun way.

1365
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,800
I can't think if the Seas macro processor was better, you could

1366
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,800
totally do it, but it ain't right.

1367
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500

1375
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:56,500
