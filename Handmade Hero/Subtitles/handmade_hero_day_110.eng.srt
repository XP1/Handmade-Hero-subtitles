00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,000
Start recording.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,300
Hello everyone and welcome to handmade Heroes show where we code a

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,100
complete game live on Twitch know, libraries.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,900
No engines.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,200
It's old-school here.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,300
And again, this is for two reasons.

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
One is educational.

8
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
It's an order to document basically the entire set of things that go

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,100
into running a game.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,200
So that there's a good reference, it just shows are absolutely.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Everything is done, there's no stuff hidden behind an engine layer.

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,900
No stuff hidden behind a library.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,400
Just every last little thing, we've coded and the other reason is

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,900
because it's a lot of fun, and it allows us to

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,500
To play around with stuff in ways that you really can't do.

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
If you don't understand the entire code base and don't have access to

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,900
all of the code.

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,100
So it's kind of interesting thing something that I think everyone

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
should do at least once.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,300
And it really doesn't take that long at the end of the day compared to

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,100
normal programming.

22
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,700
Like I said, a couple times on the stream I suspect that we'll end up

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,000
doing about 600 hours of programming here and 600 hours of programming

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,900
is, you know, it's something like three months or something like that

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,500
total of regular full-time work and that's just not very long in the

26
00:00:59,500 --> 00:00:59,800
life of a

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,300
Programmer, you know, if you write code all day, that's really just

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,700
not a big time investment, so it really doesn't take that long to do.

29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,500
Everything yourself, if you, you know, keep your keep your goals kind

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
of focused and you don't kind of Go off into sprawling territory.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,800
But anyway, all that being said, last time I believe where we left

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
off, as we just finished, kind of getting the concept of pixels out of

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,800
our main game code and putting it all into the renderer.

34
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,900
So the game codec deals almost exclusively with World units and

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is one or two last little places that we wanted to kind of get rid of

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,700
it where we were still using it.

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,200
And so that's what I'd like to take a look at today, is just finishing

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,600
that up.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
Make sure that's all buttoned up nicely so that we can go ahead and

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
assume that from now on the render is the only thing that will ever

41
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
care about pixels.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,300
And again, the reason that we're doing that is just because that makes

43
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,300
it so much more easier.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,700
In fact, it basically makes it free for us to Target multiple

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,100
resolutions because as long as the renderer is, the only thing that

46
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,800
cares about

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
pixels and the game code is all using some kind of independent unit

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,800
then, it doesn't matter what resolution we're under the game.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,699
At the game code doesn't have to change.

50
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,700
Only the renderer has to be aware of that and it can be parameterize

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,100
directly off of the resolution.

52
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,700
So that it doesn't really have to change structurally itself, either.

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,600
So, that's what we're doing.

54
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
If you'd like to follow along at home and you have pre-ordered, the

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,600
game on handmade here at, uh, org it's day 110 today.

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
So go ahead and unzip the source code for day 10 9.

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,100
So that's what I'm starting with.

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,900
And so if you

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
Want to follow along that is what you should be starting with as well.

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,400
Now let's take a look at where we left off.

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,400
I think basically we were pretty much done with making sure that

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,500
resolution independent sort of worked.

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,500
We had kind of gone ahead and prove that if we change the resolution

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,400
between 1920 by 1080 and our half resolution which is something like a

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,200
940 by 540 or something like this.

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,500
Sorry, 910 by 540, I guess it would be right, half resolution.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,700
We were just kind of trying to demonstrate the fact that everything

68
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,000
would work properly in those resolutions and it did.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,600
But like I said, we still got some additional stuff that we want to do

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
specifically with ground buffers.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,800
I believe where they weren't really working properly.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,400
As far as pixels were concerned, right, they were still using the

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,600
concept of pixels in the actual main engine.

74
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,800
So, what I want to do here is just take a look at quickly at the

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,000
places that were still using

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
Seeing pixels to meters, right?

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,100
And you know you can kind of see in fact, we can just do a little

78
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,200
search and see where that is.

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,100
You can see that we have this this notion of the world chunk right.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,500
And that's you know that's still doing a pixels to M thing here and

81
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,700
then we also have the concept of work what the cameras looking at,

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,300
right?

83
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,800
The screen with the meters and the screen height in meters.

84
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,700
And so what I'd like to do is basically get rid of those things

85
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,500
because that's really all that's left in terms of the code on the

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,800
outside.

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Using pixels in anyway.

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,300
And so if we just can excise that entirely, then we'd be back in a

89
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,000
state where we literally didn't ever have pixels being talked about on

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
the outside in any way.

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,100
Okay.

92
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,700
So mmm.

93
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,900
Let's start with the simplest of the two, I think which is the screen

94
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,000
with an m and the screen height in meters, right?

95
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,600
What I'd like to do with.

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,900
That is basically say let's make the renderer be responsible for

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,400
telling us what that is, right?

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,900
Because if we do that, then we can still have it be based on pixels if

99
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,000
we want it to be or we can have it be fixed if you want it to be and

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,900
the renderer can basically decide when it does, the camera transform

101
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,600
for the game.

102
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,800
It can decide whether it wants to use a fixed screen width and height

103
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,000
in

104
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,200
L, or whether it wants to back compute it based on the resolution and

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,000
stuff like that.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,200
So that way the game code just knows that it can ask how big it should

107
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,600
you, what the size basically should be for its culling region and the

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
renderer will return that and it doesn't really have to care whether

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,100
pixels are used or not.

110
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,600
It can just use the independent thing that comes back and that's what

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,100
I would prefer.

112
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,200
Because again I really want the only person to ever think about pixels

113
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:16,800
to be the renderer.

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,000
So we know that it's all in one place and so even if things that side

115
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,200
Add the renderer are actually using things that come from Pixel

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,600
values.

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,500
For some reason, we still just want to make sure that that's never

118
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,400
actually going to be something that the game code knows, it's doing

119
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
the game code should be totally unaware.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,100
It should always think about things in sort of direct units, right?

121
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,300
So what I'd like to do here is just go ahead and introduce a call, we

122
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,400
can get rid of that for now, I'd like to go ahead and introduce a call

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,300
here that will return the information that's being asked for basically

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,900
which is whatever that Dimension is, right.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,600
And so what I think I might do there is use one of those rectangle,

126
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,800
two things, right?

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,000
And what I'd like to do is say, if you ask the render group, right?

128
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
If you ask that render group what it's visible region is it will

129
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,700
return you a rectangle to that is that region, right?

130
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,400
And it could basically be this right now we could basically use

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,200
exactly the same computation we were using but just put it inside the

132
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,600
renderer.

133
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,500
So it's in the right place, you know, the right, the right code is

134
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,400
basically thinking about it and you can kind of see that it's related

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,800
in there.

136
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
So I'm going to put a call in here, to the render Group, which is

137
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,000
going to be like, something like get camera rectangle or something

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,600
like this.

139
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,400
And that'll be what we kind of need to do here, is say, at a

140
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,800
particular Z distance.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Because remember, the camera rectangle, gets bigger or smaller, right?

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,500
Depending on how far away from the camera.

143
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,900
It is.

144
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,000
So we probably want something like, get camera rectangle at Z, which

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,500
will tell us how big the field of view is essentially how big of a

146
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,800
rectangle in 2D.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,800
We're looking at footprint wise at a particular Z depth.

148
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,300
Right?

149
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,000
So if we pass a distance from camera here,

150
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,300
And maybe I'll call that get camera rectangle at distance, right?

151
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
And maybe we'll have another one there, which is like a rectangle to

152
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:31,000
get camera rectangle at at zero or something like this at default.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,300
0.

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm not sure exactly what I want to call that, but basically, the

155
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,100
place where the camera out Target, that's right.

156
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,300
That's basically where the camera is looking, right?

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
The, the point where the

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,900
Cameras trying to look at specifically and that's just so that we can

159
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
basically assume that.

160
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,400
That's that's the place where we're going to be doing most of our

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:50,600
work.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,700
That's like where the player is at any given time, it's that Z depth

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,500
and that's all that's going to do is just be a call that returns

164
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,100
exactly what get camera to distance does, but it passes unknown, a

165
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,100
specific distance in.

166
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Right.

167
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,700
So let's go ahead and put this in here.

168
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,600
There's our group and we'll

169
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,500
I'll have this thing.

170
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Do result.

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,900
Equals get Kim rectangle at distance and it'll be group.

172
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,100
And then what we'll do is group, you know, Target distance, or

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,100
something like that will do return results here.

174
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,300
And then, this guy will be, you know, this sort of thing where we

175
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,200
basically have shoot me.

176
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Something like this.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,200
We've got, you know, we don't really have the draw buffer here.

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
And so we'll have to decide whether we want to pass that in this will

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,500
have to.

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,000
This will basically be where we sort of start to decide whether it's

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,800
something that's back, solved or not, right?

182
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,000
So, if we decided that the camera is always the same and really has

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,800
nothing to do with pixels at all, right.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,600
Then what we could do is we could say that this this function is

185
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,600
actually very specific and how it computes m, which I think is what

186
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm honestly, that's kind of what I'm leaning towards doing and I'll

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
flip over to the Blackboard for a minute just so I can kind of show

188
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,800
you what I'm thinking here.

189
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,400
And again, this is kind of a 3D programmers way of thinking about it.

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,200
I don't know that it's necessarily the way that someone who spent most

191
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
of their days programming 2D stuff with think about it, but this is

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,800
the way I

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,400
I think about it because I'm more of a 3D programmer at the end of the

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,800
day.

195
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
So the way that I'm thinking about this is again, you know, we've kind

196
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,000
of got a world in here, right.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,600
And we've got our camera, which is looking down on that world, right?

198
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Z is pointing up this way.

199
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,700
And essentially, we sort of have this, this, you know, projection

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,800
where as you get further from the camera, right?

201
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,200
The the amount we can see is getting bigger, right?

202
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,700
So, if you're this close to the camera, the

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,700
We can see is only that big, but if we get further away from camera,

204
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,100
it's this big, right?

205
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,200
And so, I think what I'd like to do is just specify exactly what this

206
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,300
is going to be at a certain distance at whatever, our normal depth

207
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,900
distance is specify what that's going to be and use that to drive our

208
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,300
other parameters which will kind of finish out our projection

209
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
equation, how we want it to do.

210
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,200
And that way we can basically just say that, you know, the the view

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,700
this, you know,

212
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,300
What the player sees is a is a known rectangle, and if we want to, we

213
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,100
can make it so that it's unknown width or a known height and the other

214
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,600
side, just expands as necessary or something like that.

215
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,700
We could do that or we can make it so that we put in like black bars

216
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,600
or something, we'd letterbox it if they're not on a 16:9 display or

217
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,300
something like that, that's an artistic decision.

218
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,400
It really doesn't have anything to do with the math.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,200
So what I'd like to do is make sure that the math works by basically

220
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
saying okay at

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Specific distance D, which is our you know, this is our default

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,600
distance.

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,500
You know, this is our our Target distance.

224
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,100
Then at that distance, we want to basically say that we want a certain

225
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,100
number of meters let's say you know up and down maybe right.

226
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
So essentially this is like a field of view.

227
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,700
We talked about this a little bit.

228
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,700
Someone asked a question on a the end of the stream this kind of like

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,800
a field of view in why kind of a thing where we say we want to be able

230
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,200
to see a certain number of meters in Y at a certain distance.

231
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,800
That's right.

232
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:41,700
So at our Target distance, we want to be able to see a certain amount

233
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,300
of Y, okay?

234
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,100
I think that's the way I'd like to do it and then we can basically we

235
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,000
can make sure that all of our stuff works off of that.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,500
And so we kind of know that no matter what happens, we've always got

237
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,700
that and that way pixels just aren't even ever involved.

238
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,800
So it doesn't matter what the resolution of the screen is it?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,400
That matter.

240
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
Even with the aspect ratio of the screen is, we know that we always

241
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,300
see a certain vertical aspect basically.

242
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,500
All right.

243
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,300
So, I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

244
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,100
So let's take a look here, we have one projection function here and we

245
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,600
still haven't pulled it out at all.

246
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,400
It's, it's get render entity basis P.

247
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,800
It's still the thing that does all of our projection for us and what

248
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,700
you can see here is we have a focal length specified.

249
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
And we have a camera distance above Target specified.

250
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
And from that changes me.

251
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,200
Everything else is effectively derived, right?

252
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,800
So we specify those two things and then we produce everything else, we

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,400
need from that.

254
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,500
So what I want to do is I want to go ahead and pull those out, right?

255
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,700
I want to pull those out into the render group itself as basically

256
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,400
camera parameters, right?

257
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,400
So, this right here is like, the camera parameters for our, for our

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
render group, and these are things that you set to control, basically

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,800
what?

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,100
Now you know what kind of a lens are looking through, you know, the

261
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,200
fish eyes, whatever.

262
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,500
As you saw when we were playing these before, you can get very

263
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,600
different results depending on how you set the focal length and how

264
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,200
you move the camera in the world, right?

265
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,700
It basically, it controls that field of view, these two things

266
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
together, control that field of view.

267
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,800
Again, they're just the parameters, which is saying, essentially, how

268
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,400
far away is the Monitor and how far away is the Target, right?

269
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,800
And by setting those 22

270
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Whatever values we want.

271
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,500
We can basically control what that field of view is right?

272
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,300
So, okay.

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,200
So what we'd like to do is say, let's go ahead and make Jimmy

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
Let's go ahead and make these.

275
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Things that are initialized.

276
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,800
Oops.

277
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,400
When we actually initialize the stuff.

278
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,300
So, we'll put in the values that we were using, right result focal

279
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,700
length.

280
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,000
Result camera distance about Target, right?

281
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
And then, if I compile this, I just have to go in here and make sure

282
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,300
that these now come off of the render group instead.

283
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,400
So there's that and there's that focal length.

284
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,600
So and then we have to go ahead and finish up these so get camera

285
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,900
rectangle at Target.

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,300
That's just going to pass in Loops those in there.

287
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,400
That's camera distance above Target.

288
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,100
So there we go.

289
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,400
And let's just go ahead and finish this guy off.

290
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
What is this complaining about?

291
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
For identifier.

292
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Get rectangle.

293
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Oh, so is rectangle to handmade, math rectangle?

294
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,100
Yeah.

295
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,600
Sorry.

296
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,300
I don't know why.

297
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,200
I put the two like that.

298
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,900
I think that might be the way I did it in my previous math.

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So sometimes I get them confused.

300
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,400
Alright, so once we're in here,

301
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,700
We can now actually do these computations presumably fairly well,

302
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,500
right all we would really need to know is what the aspect ratio of the

303
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,400
display is, right?

304
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Because if we want, we can actually figure out using that projection

305
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,900
equation.

306
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,600
We can figure out exactly what the actual bounds of this thing will be

307
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:24,800
right.

308
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,700
If we take a look at what that projected X Y is right, you can

309
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,500
imagine, you know?

310
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
So here's the equation right projected XY.

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,200
It's 1 over distance, 2 pz and

312
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Actually is this this thing right here.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,900
That's the distance from the camera, right?

314
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:41,900
Excuse me.

315
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
So, you can actually see here.

316
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,300
We got camera distance above Target - entity base Z.

317
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,800
That's that's what that guy is, right.

318
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So this is just the total distance from the camera.

319
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
We've already got the focal length, right?

320
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
And so, the projected ex-wife or anything is just going to be whatever

321
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,200
this raw X Y is,

322
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Right?

323
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,900
So what we want to know, if we want to know, what the outside of the

324
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,800
screen is right, if we've got a projection equation, if we want to

325
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,900
know what the outside of the screen is,

326
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,300
and this kind of gets back to, I guess how we want to structure this.

327
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,200
Because, like, I was saying before, normally in here, you know, we've

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
got this m 2 pixels thing, right?

329
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,900
And so normally we kind of have this this sort of open question of how

330
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,100
we're going to specify that still.

331
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,300
We just kind of used it the way we were using it.

332
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,200
But if we want to be able to compute stuff like this,

333
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,600
All we have to do.

334
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Shoot me Mom.

335
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah, all we would have to know is, you know, how big that the monitor

336
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,500
is right?

337
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,200
How big we want the, the concept of this monitor to be.

338
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,800
And then we know that, however, far out we go, it just it basically,

339
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,700
just gets bigger based on this projection equation, right?

340
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,400
And so really, all we need to do for the raw XY is we just have to in.

341
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,400
We would just have to initialize raw, X Y to be the dimensions, you

342
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,099
know, half the dimension of the monitor, right?

343
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:23,900
Basically, like,

344
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,400
Whatever this, you know, half the dimension sizes there, right?

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And that would give us what that expansion is actually going to be,

346
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,400
right?

347
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,600
Because if we're talking about projecting, if we're talking about

348
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,300
figuring out, how the reverse projection is, I'm not explaining this

349
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,700
very well, let me, let me, let me try again, let me try again here.

350
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,100
I'm going to draw the same side view that we were using before for

351
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,000
doing our projection.

352
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
You can tell I've been offered a as things start to get a little

353
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,100
wonky.

354
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,900
Okay, so here's the camera.

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Right here and here is are similar triangles again, right.

356
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
And so what we want to know is the outside of the screen which is the

357
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
projected x y

358
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,100
Right.

359
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,600
This point right here, what we want to know is at some other distance.

360
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,400
So you know, here's here's the monitor distance, right?

361
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,300
This is the monitor distance away, or this is what we were calling it.

362
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
We're calling the focal length, right?

363
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,500
This focal length.

364
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,400
And here's the projected, whatever the coordinate is the projected

365
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,000
coordinate.

366
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,500
We want to figure out what the raw is.

367
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,300
Basically, it's like the inverse of the thing for some other distance,

368
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:41,800
right?

369
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,300
So this is like the hypothetical distance that we put in.

370
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,200
We want to know

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
if we were to put the monitors, you know, the farthest edge of the

372
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,200
monitor,

373
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,500
Into what the projected was, what would the raw come out to be right?

374
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,400
And this is that equation that we have here, right?

375
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,500
And so we want to know the raw XY.

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,600
Assuming that we were to put in a particular projected, X Y, which

377
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,500
would be the corner of the monitor, right?

378
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,700
And so as you can see, it's in the wrong form after that, we just have

379
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,900
to solve this equation, but we can do that really trivially, right?

380
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,400
If we just, we don't have to do it on the Blackboard, right?

381
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,300
Here's the equation.

382
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,800
What we can do is First Steps A alright /, this right?

383
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,600
And of course, you can see.

384
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
This is already a division, so it would literally just turn into a

385
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,500
multiply right multiply both sides by that to get rid of this.

386
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,100
And then you divide by that focal length because the focal length of

387
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
course is with multiplying the Rocks.

388
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,500
Why?

389
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,300
And so then we would end up with this equation which is just the

390
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,500
reverse of our projection, right?

391
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,700
So in other words, if we just reverse that exact equation, we can now

392
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,100
plug in something on the Monitor and get out something out in the

393
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,200
world which is what we want.

394
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,700
So what we can do is we can get, we can really think of this, in fact,

395
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,800
we could even make a function for this right.

396
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:09,600
Which is just like, you know, on Project or something like that, which

397
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,300
undoes whatever that projection is.

398
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,900
And it's just this equation, right?

399
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,400
It just you takes in a projected, x, y and returns.

400
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,300
You like a world, XY, write something like that.

401
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,600
And this is a pretty common thing you would see in a game, right?

402
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,900
It would be a little more complicated than this normally because we're

403
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,600
a little simplified since we're in 2D, but it's basically something

404
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,900
that you would typically want to do.

405
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,700
Pick a point on

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,700
The screen and tell me where that point actually ends up being in the

407
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,200
world at a particular distance.

408
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,700
Right?

409
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,300
And so, we'll just go ahead and say this right here.

410
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,500
In fact, I guess we could take in a 3D, which is basically a projected

411
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,700
x y and a Nazi.

412
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,900
Although, that's a little confusing.

413
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,000
So maybe we'll just say at world z, right?

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So, add a particular Z depth, and that's where this comes in here,

415
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,200
right?

416
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,700
Or I should say,

417
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,700
At distance from camera, I guess is a probably a better thing because

418
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
it's not an absolute World coordinate.

419
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,400
So if I want to know at a particular distance away from the camera,

420
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,100
what would the world xyb of something that was, you know, that far

421
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,400
away and that would give it to me, right?

422
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
So, now I can just do one project.

423
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,300
And I guess I have to pass the group here too so that it knows the

424
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,000
focal length.

425
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,200
Because without the focal length, right?

426
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,000
It can't figure that out.

427
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,700
So that looks like about it.

428
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,200
So when we get camera town at distance, we pass in that distance from

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,800
camera.

430
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,900
We now need to do the unprojected and the unprojected is like, so

431
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:50,900
down.

432
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,400
And now we're back to basically just try to figure out what we would

433
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,200
actually fill in in terms of the projected X Y.

434
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,300
Now in this particular case, right?

435
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,500
The thing that we don't really know is we don't really know how big

436
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,100
We expect that monitor to actually be.

437
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,500
We've got our m 2 pixels here, right.

438
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,200
We've got

439
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,800
Excuse me.

440
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We know that we're essentially doing everything in meters.

441
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,200
So after we do the projection, we expand it out by that pixel amount.

442
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,700
So we know that we don't have to think about pixels in particular

443
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,200
here, but we do have to decide at this point, is how big that monitor

444
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,700
is in terms of width and height either way?

445
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:42,400
Right, we have to figure out essentially, the reverse of this, of this

446
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,100
equation, right?

447
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,800
Because what determines what the corner of the monitor

448
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,500
Here is is however, far you would have to go from the center of the

449
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,100
screen to get to one of the edges of the monitor, right.

450
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,400
Which is going to be, however, many meters.

451
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,700
It would take to cover as many pixels as there are on that display,

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,600
right?

453
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,900
And so that's why again, we still have to use that value and we'll

454
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,600
have to, we can, we can maybe get a little, we can go a little further

455
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,800
than this, but at first, I want to to show this part of it.

456
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,800
So if you imagine going, okay, if we've got the draw, buffer buffer,

457
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,300
Whit, we need to go essentially 1/2 right of the with

458
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,700
We need to go one half of the width and we need to go in, basically.

459
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
We want

460
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,100
We want pixels to M here, right?

461
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,600
We want to turn that into a m value and the same is true of the

462
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,500
height, right?

463
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,200
So, this is how far we would go in m, to get to the corner of the

464
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,400
screen, right?

465
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,600
And if we plug that projected XY into our equation, then we should get

466
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,300
out.

467
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,100
Whatever.

468
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Our raw XY is is again, also, half of the dimension there and in fact,

469
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,800
I guess since we want the full Dimension, we can actually just not

470
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,500
Fly by half and just say, okay, please project out what that actual

471
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,200
value is going to be, although actually that's not quite right?

472
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,500
We still probably want to do it this way because that's the actual,

473
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,100
correct distance.

474
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,600
And then after we do the project out, then I would say, we want to

475
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,400
put, put that in because because we want to do the result wants to be

476
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
a rectangle centre-half.

477
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,900
Tim, write that kind of a thing where we construct a rectangle based

478
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,700
on the center which is just going to be at 0 0 and whatever that that

479
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:29,800
have

480
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,900
If Dimension was.

481
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
So I think that's mostly everything that we needed.

482
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,600
And the problem here is we just are going to need that pixels to M

483
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,200
value right in order to actually figure out what our screen dimension

484
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,500
is.

485
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,300
And in order to do that, that's something we have to set based on the

486
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,100
resolution.

487
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Again, we don't really, why did I delete that?

488
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,500
It doesn't make sense.

489
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,800
Again, we don't really care about this.

490
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,900
We could just fix that meter size.

491
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,300
And maybe that's what we should do.

492
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,500
But if we do that,

493
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,300
we kind of also have to back solve for this.

494
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,200
So let's take it one step at a time.

495
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,300
I'm going to do this.

496
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,400
And then I'm going to go ahead and try to take it one notch further,

497
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,900
just to make it into a more fixed meter size for the screen, right?

498
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,700
I don't know what that still doing in there.

499
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
So let's get rid of that.

500
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,300
So yeah, so when we call get camera rectangle at distance for right

501
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,100
now and right now only, I'm going to go ahead and call pass in that

502
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,500
draw buffer like

503
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,200
And then also the pixels to meters just for a second.

504
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,400
So that will be something that we do temporarily and then we'll remove

505
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,700
them.

506
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,500
Let's see rectangle.

507
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,300
Two results.

508
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
Yes, that is multiple definition.

509
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Get rid of that, centre-half.

510
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:06,200
Tim, do we not have that one rectangle Center just called wrecked.

511
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,100
Yeah.

512
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,400
And yeah, so these guys both have to do that although I guess we could

513
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
well no, okay we'll do it that way.

514
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,800
Okay.

515
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,400
Let's draw, buffer and pixels to M ever again.

516
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,300
Now, what I want to do first is I'm going to go ahead and step in here

517
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,700
and I want to see what we're actually getting in terms of the that

518
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,500
size here, which I guess actually, now that I think about it at the

519
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,100
moment is actually totally erroneous, right?

520
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,800
Like we never updated.

521
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,800
This stuff at all.

522
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,700
So it's basically just wrong when we put it in here.

523
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,200
This this stuff right here just doesn't mean anything anymore, right.

524
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,100
Because since we added in that projection it's no longer the case that

525
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,800
m 2 pixels

526
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,500
Constant in terms of where we're drawing, right?

527
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,700
So this these are actually totally meaningless values at the moment,

528
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
but let's just take a look at what they were.

529
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,400
So we've got screen wit and meters and Screen height in meters.

530
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Oops, looks like we

531
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,500
looks like we've got

532
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
optimization still turned on.

533
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Let's go ahead and turn that off useful.

534
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,700
As those are

535
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Again, okay.

536
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,400
So if we go ahead and look at what those are, it's 22 and 12.

537
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,700
So 22, metres across 12 meters down, which seems reasonable, right?

538
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,500
Seems like a reasonable size for a room roughly.

539
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,600
That's what we were getting.

540
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,000
And so now let's go ahead and try putting in

541
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,800
This new call just so we can step through that and debug that.

542
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,300
Okay?

543
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,800
So what I'm going to do here is say rectangle to camera or just test,

544
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,200
I guess.

545
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,100
And we'll go ahead and call this render group function.

546
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,900
So we'll say, get camera rectangle, at Target, and the target will be

547
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,300
the draw buffer.

548
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,300
Let's see, we've got pixels to meters past in there.

549
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,600
We've got the render group like so.

550
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
And then we've got

551
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,000
Because the distance to camera is given.

552
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,600
It's just the default Target distance.

553
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,000
All right.

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,100
So I just want to see what that actually does when we step in here,

555
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,800
right?

556
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
And let's see what we actually pass.

557
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,000
So distance to camera is 5 meters, which is what we're expecting.

558
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,200
There's everything here.

559
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Looks pretty good.

560
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,000
My mouse is kind of sticky there.

561
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,500
There we go.

562
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,400
So the projected X Y that we initialize it with is 11:6 which again

563
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,700
makes some sense.

564
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,100
Does that make sense?

565
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,600
um,

566
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,700
I need to think about that a little more but we'll leave that for now,

567
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
we take a look at what the Rocks.

568
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Why is comes out rocks?

569
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,800
Why is 9.5 5.3?

570
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,500
So it's a little bit smaller than where the, the default monitor size

571
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,000
and then we have our results here, which should be, you know, double

572
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,800
that essentially in size and it is so that all looks relatively good

573
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,400
and off, we go.

574
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,400
And if we take a look at what it actually runs here,

575
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,800
of course, it's very slow at the moment because it's being built

576
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,500
without optimizations on which is sort of a nightmare, but

577
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,900
I guess now that I think about it, one of the nice things about being

578
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
To reload code live is if I turn on compiler optimizations, we just

579
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
kind of get that for free, I guess, in the middle of running.

580
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,400
And so I think that's about right in terms of meters.

581
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,900
Because again, if a room is 22, M and now we're looking at about 18 of

582
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,900
them, you can see that we kind of have a little bit left of the room

583
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,800
to go from side to side, so that all seems relatively reasonable.

584
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,600
So, let's keep on the march of tightening this down because we're

585
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,900
still not quite there yet, and there's a little bit of wishy-washy.

586
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,200
Watching us, they're in my head.

587
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
A lot of times, I'm just like, yeah, it's not quite right.

588
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,200
I don't like the way we're conceptualizing this or that.

589
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,500
You know what I mean?

590
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,400
So the first thing that I'd also, I guess the first thing I'd like to

591
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,800
do is say alright let's let's try and get back to pushing the monitor

592
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,200
size back to something more sane because again, that monitor size is

593
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,300
ridiculously large.

594
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,900
If you take a look at what we're saying, the monitor is at the focal

595
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,100
length that we're using which just seems kind of weird.

596
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,300
I don't really understand why that would be the case either because it

597
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,600
seems to me, we should be able to reduce the focal length and then

598
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,300
reduce the size of the monitor.

599
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,800
so I think, basically, what we have is we sort of have essentially a

600
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,800
We now have the pixels to M thing is kind of constraining us.

601
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,600
I keep keeping it in there but the problem with that is that it

602
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,700
prevents us from getting out of the business of thinking of pixels

603
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,700
when we're doing the transform which is kind of bothering me, right?

604
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,900
Because if you think about it, if we go to the render group

605
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,300
And we go to get render entity basis, right?

606
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,600
This m, 2 pixels thing.

607
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,400
What that's essentially doing is that's m, 2 pixels on the monitor,

608
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:41,600
right?

609
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
And we kind of mentioned this the other day.

610
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,700
And so what I'd rather do here is say when we are actually figuring

611
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,400
out what that is.

612
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,000
It's not m 2 pixels in the world anymore.

613
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
It's m 2 pixels on the monitor.

614
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,400
So on the monitor, how big should it?

615
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,700
M.

616
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,600
B is basically what we're asking now, right?

617
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,200
And so if you figure you're talking about a normal size Monitor and we

618
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,500
go back to some more same values here.

619
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,700
And in fact, I'm just going to call.

620
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,500
I'm going to I'm going to actually go ahead and actually solidify this

621
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,400
now, because now that I'm actually thinking about a little more

622
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,700
clearly m, 2 pixels on monitor, right?

623
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,600
It's kind of like or I should say monitor, m 2 pixels or I don't know

624
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,000
what you want to call this m.

625
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,000
I guess we can still call it, m 2 pixels.

626
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,700
But say something like, this is the size.

627
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,700
This translates meters on the monitor into pixels on the monitor,

628
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,100
right?

629
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,700
If that makes sense.

630
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,000
So now we could probably start to assume some Center default this m 2

631
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,600
pixels.

632
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,000
What we want to know is essentially for a certain number of meters on

633
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,400
the monitor.

634
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,800
So let's say, you know, it would be something.

635
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,100
Like trying to think of how big a monitor would normally be I guess

636
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,400
let's let's talk about something like gay.

637
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,500
Let's see how many meters.

638
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,700
So you have a 30-inch monitor 30 inches in meters, right?

639
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,500
So that's how many meters that is diagonally, right?

640
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,700
And so, if I wanted to know what that was going to be square, I don't

641
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,700
actually know what they typically are in terms of

642
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,400
What at what a normal monitor is in terms of Dimensions.

643
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Let's just take a look, let's say, like, dimensions of a 30-inch

644
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
monitor, can you tell us what that, what it is?

645
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,300
Dell 30-inch monitor.

646
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,000
Okay, did they have specs?

647
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Tech specs?

648
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Let's see.

649
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,500
Let's see here.

650
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,500
Wait with where's the width and height H inches?

651
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,800
22 inches extended.

652
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,300
That's not really the screen.

653
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,300
The size though, I want to know what the screen size tends to be

654
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,000
course, this isn't 16 by 9.

655
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,199
Unfortunately twenty seven point two, six inches roughly of the

656
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:14,500
monitor.

657
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,400
It's not quite, right?

658
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
So we'll say something.

659
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,000
Let's pretend it's something like 25 inches.

660
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,199
Seems good enough.

661
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,699
So, let's say that we're going to be that many meters across, right?

662
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,300
So, if that's how many meters we are across the monitor, right?

663
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,300
The actual size of the monitor, then we could actually just sort of

664
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,699
say if we wanted to make a good approximation here, we could say that

665
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:47,600
result, m, 2 pixels here is that many times what we expect the

666
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
resolution to be, right?

667
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,699
We want we want 920.

668
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,600
Over a width of Point 635 M, right?

669
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300
That makes sense pretty simple.

670
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,500
This is how many pixels are you know we're sort of thinking about on a

671
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
display let's say and here we go.

672
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:11,100
And now we'll put the to do in here which is need to adjust this based

673
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,700
on

674
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,500
Buffer size.

675
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,900
In fact, I guess what I should say is when we allocate the render

676
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,700
group, we probably want to specify that.

677
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,000
So we want to actually have that pixel size coming in here, probably

678
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,500
loaded, bitmap screen, buffer, or something.

679
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,700
Or we could actually say something like this, which is resolution

680
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:39,100
pixels x and resolution pixels wide, something like that.

681
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,800
And so then we can just say, okay, we know that we want to expand

682
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,400
roughly

683
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,500
Size of a thing out into this many pixels in X, right?

684
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,600
So, if now we have that, then we can go here and make a saner thing,

685
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,100
you know, that our values will now mean something a little bit saner.

686
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,700
I think get

687
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,900
And basis.

688
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,300
So if we actually take out the m 2 pixels.

689
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:09,400
Now from being passed in here, and we say that, it's now going to be

690
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,400
rendered.

691
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,700
Root m, 2 pixels here?

692
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,100
Let's see where else we've got M to pixels there.

693
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,900
That seems standard to me.

694
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
That's just a seems like a better way to go.

695
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,100
Now, I suspect, we can set our focal length of something.

696
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,000
That makes sense.

697
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,000
Instead of being as such a large value, which didn't seem right

698
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,300
because I feel like it should be something like point three or

699
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,900
something like that because it should be however, far a person,

700
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,700
normally sits away from their 30-inch monitor, right?

701
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,600
That should give us a reasonable thing, if we were to plug that in

702
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
there, right?

703
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,200
So let's see here.

704
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
Pixels 2 m.

705
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,100
Where does that actually get past?

706
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:54,100
That gets passed to draw a rectangle slowly and that looks like about

707
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,500
it.

708
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:04,000
So really all we need to do there is say that this is 1 / render group

709
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,800
2 pixels.

710
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,900
Okay.

711
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,200
This no longer gets passed.

712
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,900
So and now when we actually allocate a render group, we kind of have

713
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,100
to tell it what that size actually is going to be which is fine.

714
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Now, foreground chunks, it's a little bit weirder because we, of

715
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,900
course, don't really know exactly what we want to do for that.

716
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
So that's a little that's a little wonky, right?

717
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,200
Look, we don't actually know what we want and that's sort of a, this

718
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,900
is the big to do here that we have to do.

719
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,100
How do we want to control our ground chunk resolution?

720
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,700
Because that's kind of a whole another.

721
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,900
That's a whole another

722
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,800
Ballgame there.

723
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,900
So, for now, I'm going to totally make this up, but but that's going

724
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,300
to be sort of the next thing is to get those ground chunks working and

725
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
we'll take that out.

726
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,100
So when we allocate this render group, we can just pass it.

727
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:11,500
The draw buffer width and height like so.

728
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,300
And I guess actually that's not quite true yet.

729
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,200
There we go.

730
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,000
And so now I suspect our projection should be all messed up like it is

731
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,600
because we actually still haven't gone in and refreshed.

732
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,500
Those values that I just said, we should like the focal length which

733
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,400
is going to be totally messed up at the moment here.

734
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,000
Where is that focal length?

735
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,200
Let's see.

736
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,700
Allocate groups under group

737
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:50,400
Render group and the now we can say yeah, the focal length I think

738
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,600
should be much smaller than that, right?

739
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,300
It should be roughly how far someone sits from a monitor which I guess

740
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,400
I don't actually know.

741
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,100
How big that is.

742
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,800
Let's say that that focal length is what is that focal length?

743
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,300
So I say I would say, I sit about maybe two feet from the monitor two

744
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,500
feet in meters roughly.

745
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,600
So that's point 6 that seems.

746
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,700
Yeah, I'd ballpark about two feet from a monitor that's about that

747
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,200
size.

748
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,900
So something like that.

749
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,200
And that looks pretty good, that looks like roughly.

750
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,100
What we had tuned it to before, in fact, and so I hope you can see

751
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,500
again, this was just kind of me pushing through things until we got to

752
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:41,900
it.

753
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,000
This was really the big thing that we had messed up before, right?

754
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,400
When I said things were wonky, that was the one keenness.

755
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,400
The wonkiness was that m 2 pixels was a totally wrong value.

756
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,300
Because we were on the, at the point that we were using it, we were on

757
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,100
the surface of the Moon.

758
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,600
We had projected things to where we think the monitor surface is.

759
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,600
And at that point, we needed to think about how many pixels should one

760
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
meter be on the monitor, right?

761
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,000
Not in the world, and so, this was actually like a value.

762
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,200
That's, that's almost, I guess in the real world, not in the game

763
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,700
world.

764
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
So it needs to be based on that and now you can see that we've

765
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,900
actually gotten to the point where we're using essentially.

766
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,000
All real world values like the focal length, right?

767
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,700
This is

768
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,400
M, the person is sitting from their monitor, right?

769
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,600
This right here is like a I could specify what this value is, it is

770
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,500
like, with of monitor, right?

771
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,300
so,

772
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,000
horizontal measurement of monitor in meters.

773
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,100
Right.

774
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,600
And now we sort of got a real world scenario with all real world

775
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,100
values.

776
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,300
And now, the only thing that we would play with is just how far above

777
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,200
the target we are.

778
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,500
And we know that for a typical user scenario of a typical person

779
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,800
sitting, in front of a typical gaming PC, they will get something that

780
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,600
looks exactly.

781
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,500
Right.

782
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,900
It actually has the right perspective as if things were that far away

783
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,200
from them behind their monitor screen.

784
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,300
So, it's no longer a

785
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,300
Medical word values, that's what it is.

786
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,700
And again, we can control that Distance by just sort of pushing things

787
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,800
further, or closer from the camera by basically just saying how high

788
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,100
above them.

789
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,200
The camera is.

790
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,700
And so now we just have that one value which is really nice.

791
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,700
I can just kind of set that to that one value to basically Zoom.

792
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,600
As much as I want to zoom, and then we're done right now.

793
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,200
That means I can go ahead as well and get rid of this stuff, which is

794
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,400
good.

795
00:41:59,500 --> 00:41:59,800
Good.

796
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,600
I can say, get camera rectangle at distance, no longer has to take

797
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,000
either of those two things.

798
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:09,500
Because now, I could actually, these are actually being specified

799
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:16,000
directly in that in that code in the, in the draw before group, so we

800
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
can get them out of there.

801
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,000
So I'm going to go ahead and make sure that we store those for our

802
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,100
hypothetical use.

803
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:22,800
Right?

804
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,700
So what I want to do is say we've essentially got, in fact, what I

805
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,600
could do here is almost just store this

806
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,900
In the thing as well.

807
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,600
I could just store what that what that corner value is.

808
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,300
So, maybe in the render group, I could store a something like, a

809
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,200
rectangle to, which is whatever that projected X Y is.

810
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,700
So, this is like half Tim in meters or something like the monitor.

811
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,000
10:30 in meters.

812
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,800
Right.

813
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:57,300
And then monitor half-demon m is that projected x y

814
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,200
So, we'll just store this guy up above somewhere and projected X Y,

815
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,900
will just now pass group, monitor half-demon m.

816
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,600
Okay.

817
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,900
So that is about that and there's a little further.

818
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,300
We might want to go with this, I'm not sure I'd have to think about

819
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,100
it, but if you can just go ahead and do this for now.

820
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:30,700
So this is resolution pixels x and resolution pixels why?

821
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
And then we have

822
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,800
Pixels to meters, which is just 1 over m 2 pixels.

823
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,300
So oops, what did I do?

824
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,500
Group monitor have to in meters distance from camera group?

825
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,600
Cannot convert.

826
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,700
That is not the right kind of value.

827
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,800
We go and this no longer has to take anything.

828
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,500
So there we go.

829
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:03,100
And now we've got all of our stuff in theory anyway, working through

830
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,300
that new function.

831
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,500
So all we have to do now is actually use that value and what we can

832
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,300
do, what I'd like

833
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,400
To do is in fact this is probably a good time to introduce this as

834
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:13,600
well.

835
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,400
We have a little bit of time left on the stream so I think I'm going

836
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,300
to go ahead and do it.

837
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,100
What I'd like to do is say okay, let's switch over to using this

838
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,800
rectangle, this new camera bounds rectangle, right?

839
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,000
So this is the screen bounds, we're getting back.

840
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,600
I want to go ahead and use that so we can get rid of pixels to meters

841
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,000
here.

842
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,100
But if I want to do that, I I want to know if I'm doing it.

843
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,600
Right?

844
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:38,800
Right.

845
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,200
I want to know if this ends up being

846
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,500
Being correct.

847
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,400
And unfortunately I don't actually know any way to do that with what

848
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,700
we've got.

849
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,700
Like I don't have a, I shouldn't say don't know.

850
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Anyway, I don't have a way because let's say, we do this, right?

851
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,500
And one way that we might figure out that that we've done all the math

852
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,300
wrong and it's coming out incorrectly, we're using these camera bounds

853
00:44:59,300 --> 00:44:59,900
to pick

854
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,000
Sim region if the camera bound is much too small then maybe we

855
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,100
wouldn't pull any any entities into the region like we could see that

856
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,300
happen, right?

857
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,900
But it I do here.

858
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,900
Oh right.

859
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,600
Sorry about that, to do this sort of thing.

860
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,800
Rekt min-max.

861
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,100
Like, so, so, let's do that.

862
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:37,900
I guess we could just do the three screen bounds Min and V3 screen lb

863
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,600
Max because they automatically zero extend now, right?

864
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,400
So, there we go.

865
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,400
At least, I thought they did.

866
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,600
Did we not do that?

867
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,200
Do we leave it as 2 V 3.

868
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,600
I thought we did one with the Zeke's and I guess maybe we have to pass

869
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,200
in what we want it to be.

870
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,300
So the zoo or extend is an automatic.

871
00:45:59,400 --> 00:45:59,700
Yeah.

872
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,900
So what I was trying to say here is, all right, so we're getting this

873
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,200
new screen bound back and we weren't using that previously.

874
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,700
So I'm plugging this into camera bouncing M and one thing that might

875
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,600
happen is like, I don't see any entities on the screen.

876
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,100
Like it's just the wrong rectangular something and then I would know

877
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,500
it was broken, right?

878
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,700
And then we can go and fix it and, you know, maybe that happens.

879
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,800
But as you can see, that's not what happened, right?

880
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,600
It's like everything's still working properly, but

881
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,400
Question now is well, I want to start actually, you know, we're

882
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,100
starting to get a little bit further into the type of code where I

883
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,200
want to actually validate that I'm doing things correctly for all.

884
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,300
I know it could be returning, some giant rectangle, that includes

885
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:33,900
everything.

886
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,800
And what I want to do is make sure that it's actually returning the

887
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,300
rectangle that's just the screen size, right?

888
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,000
And so what I'm going to do is I want to draw something in here.

889
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,000
And there's two things I can do here, I'll do the simplest one first

890
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,400
and then I'm going to do a slightly more complicated one.

891
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,500
But what I'm going to do here,

892
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,700
Is I'm going to draw this rectangle that we got back.

893
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I want to draw that rectangle so we can actually see what it what it

894
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,600
actually looks like, right?

895
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,400
Like where it actually is and we should see it pegged to our screen,

896
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
no matter where we go.

897
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,200
It should be exactly.

898
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,600
They're right because we're solving for the exact outline of the

899
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:17,900
screen.

900
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,000
And so if it doesn't look like that, we know, something's weird,

901
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,600
right?

902
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,900
So let's go ahead and draw it first.

903
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,700
Push back that line.

904
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,200
So we know that it's basically at 000, right?

905
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,300
It's just, it's just at the, there's really nothing to that and then

906
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,400
we know that it's the screen bounds is the dimension, right, screen

907
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,300
bounds, and we'll draw that as a nice.

908
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,500
Lovely bright yellow because, you know, I love my bright yellows.

909
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,800
We go, what is the problem, screen bounds to V2?

910
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,800
Can we do, do we have get

911
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,500
Dim of?

912
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Do we have that?

913
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,800
Let's see what we've got.

914
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,400
I want to wait to just get the dimensions of a rectangle, but I don't

915
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,000
know.

916
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,100
You've got Min Corner Max Corner.

917
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,300
We don't actually have get Dimension, right?

918
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,700
We just don't, we don't have a thing that actually gets the dimension.

919
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,600
So I want like a wrecked Max - rectum in that kind of thing, right?

920
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,800
All right.

921
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,300
So you can kind of see now that we're getting the exact right

922
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,700
rectangle for the, for the screen, right?

923
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,700
Which is, which is cool.

924
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:36,000
So now we can like verify, okay, we're actually solving for that

925
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,700
region properly and that's all good.

926
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,600
So we're even though we're going through all the back transform and

927
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,100
all that stuff.

928
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,700
It's now we know exactly how big it was right and so that's pretty

929
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,100
awesome.

930
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:51,500
But there's one more thing that we probably want to do which is like

931
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,500
let's say that we wanted to see when entities were coming in and out

932
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,400
of that active set, right?

933
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,100
And in order to do that I'm going to have to add some entities that

934
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,000
are I guess.

935
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Oh well no I don't I could just make it so that I kind of I can just

936
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,300
walk away from the end of days out here, can't I?

937
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Now I can't because we've got those spaces that will stop me.

938
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,300
So what I'm going to need to do temporarily just to kind of show you

939
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,100
this I want

940
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,900
Make it so that we've got some rooms that we can walk through, right?

941
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,600
I want to be able to walk through some rooms.

942
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,100
So instead of setting door Direction, 23 all the time, just going to

943
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,200
let it do its thing.

944
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:32,900
So that when we start the game, we get an actual sort of a real

945
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,600
situation.

946
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,300
What is this doing here?

947
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,000
This is, this is forcing me to go to go up a, yeah,

948
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,100
There we go.

949
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,500
So, as we walk around here, what I want to do is I want to be able to,

950
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,500
I want to be able to see edit, he's coming in and out of the same

951
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,600
region, right?

952
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,100
But right now, I can't do that, right?

953
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,700
There's no way for me to actually see that information because it's

954
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,400
off the screen, right?

955
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,700
So one way that I could do that is, I could go in, and

956
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
Move the camera out, right?

957
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,900
Like if I wanted to see where everything was, I just go in and move

958
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,200
the camera out, right?

959
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,000
But that's not going to work.

960
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Because if I go in here and change the camera distance above Target to

961
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,200
something else, right?

962
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,800
If I change cameras is about Target to something quite High.

963
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,800
What will happen is now that we're solving for the screen dimensions,

964
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,700
it will make sure that it pulls all of those things in right.

965
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,700
Which is exactly not what we wanted to do.

966
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,800
We want to be able to move out and have it act like the screen is

967
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,000
actually smaller.

968
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,300
Okay, so what I want to do here is I want to introduce the concept of

969
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:57,600
a debug value there which will allow us to set both a camera distance

970
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,800
above the target.

971
00:50:59,300 --> 00:50:59,700
That.

972
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,900
What we want the game to think we're using and it camera distance

973
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,600
above Target.

974
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,700
That's what we will actually use, right?

975
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,600
And so, what we want to do here is basically isolate.

976
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,700
What I'm going to do is I'm going to pull out render group camera.

977
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,500
I'm going to make the thing here for camera.

978
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,300
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull out all of these values

979
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:27,400
that were using to control our transform, write this stuff and I'm

980
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:34,200
going to have a, you know, essentially game camera and debug camera or

981
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,300
or something like this or camera and debug camera, right?

982
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,600
And the debug camera,

983
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,900
The one that will actually use when we're sort of flip to a debug

984
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:49,000
State and the camera is the one that everyone will always use except

985
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,900
for the actual render calls, right?

986
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,100
And so that way, like we can kind of have sort of The Best of Both

987
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:54,900
Worlds there, right?

988
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,400
I might be a little confusing at first but hopefully you'll see what I

989
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,300
mean in a second.

990
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,300
Okay, so when we come in here, I can also eliminate some of these

991
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,600
things like just distance above Target.

992
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:10,400
Like so now, I don't know if we actually need M to pixels and monitor

993
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,800
have Tim.

994
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,400
Now, I think about it.

995
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,400
So I'm going to leave those.

996
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,100
Just temporarily going to leave those out, right?

997
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,100
I'm going to leave those out.

998
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:21,900
And so if we go in here and do a camera dot distance from Target

999
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,800
camera, that focal length right again.

1000
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,100
Camera that focal length camera distance above

1001
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:30,800
Target.

1002
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,600
And then I'm going to also do result, debug camera, angles result

1003
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,000
camera.

1004
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,300
So it's just going to be the same camera only.

1005
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,700
Then I'm going to go ahead and set its distance to be much higher,

1006
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,600
like I was saying, and then here again, camera focal length.

1007
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,400
And see here camera distance about Target, right?

1008
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,900
So now I've changed absolutely nothing but we're working off of those

1009
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,600
trucks now.

1010
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,100
And now what I want to do is be able to say hey when you go to do the

1011
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:07,900
rendering I want you to essentially use, you know, whatever.

1012
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,000
The in fact I guess debug camera is probably the wrong one.

1013
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,200
This will just be game camera and render camera.

1014
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,000
Let's do it that way.

1015
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,900
It seems a little bit better, so render camera.

1016
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:25,300
So let's keep going under camera that.

1017
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,000
So this is render camera.

1018
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,000
Render camera, it's good that wrong.

1019
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,100
This is actually.

1020
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,100
All right.

1021
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,100
Go and this is always game camera.

1022
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,500
And kincannon, okay.

1023
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,200
All right.

1024
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So what I would like to do now.

1025
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,800
Well, actually, yes, you can.

1026
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
See it, since they're set to different sizes, you can now see exactly

1027
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,800
what's going on in the world at a much more zoomed out level, right,

1028
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,800
and you can see things coming in and out of the same region.

1029
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,200
Now, what's kind of interesting, when you look at this, we can kind of

1030
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,000
already see that.

1031
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,500
We have a potential bug here.

1032
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,900
Things seem to be moving in and out of the same region based on our X

1033
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,400
location.

1034
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,100
Just fine.

1035
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,000
But they don't seem to be moving in and out of the same region based

1036
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,100
on our Y at all, right?

1037
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,600
And you can see, again, it's pretty cool.

1038
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,200
The way this works.

1039
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,800
We can see that yellow region shows us exactly where it thinks the

1040
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,400
camera is but already just doing that simple.

1041
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,600
Having that simple difference between a debug camera and the regular

1042
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
camera allows us to spot errors.

1043
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,000
Very, very simply in our routines, right?

1044
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,200
It allows us this really, really convenient way to very simply, you

1045
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,800
know, sort of call out that error, right?

1046
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,400
And so that, basically, now it's

1047
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,000
Free for us to set those two things separately between render camera

1048
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,900
and debug camera.

1049
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,600
And I don't know, we probably don't have very much time here because

1050
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,600
you got three minutes we could go try to look to see what's going on

1051
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,300
with that particular bug.

1052
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,300
In terms of Y, the x is working but the why is not working.

1053
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,400
So I could sort of try to take a look at that.

1054
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,100
Let's, let's take a quick look here.

1055
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,500
Screen bounds.

1056
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,100
I got back.

1057
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,000
That, that thing will be.

1058
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,300
We produce the camera, balance and M.

1059
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,200
We expand the Z.

1060
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:33,400
And then what do we do with that camera bounds in M?

1061
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,400
Expand that Z.

1062
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,100
We then map that into the trunk space.

1063
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,400
Let's see.

1064
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,100
That's four grand buffers so we don't really care about that soon

1065
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,200
bounds expansion.

1066
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,900
It should expand 15 meters in both X and Y ad radius to some bounds

1067
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:54,400
expansion camera bands and M and then we pass.

1068
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:55,600
What do we actually do?

1069
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,900
We pass in bounds into the Sim region.

1070
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,500
And off we go, let's take a look.

1071
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,700
Let me just take a look quickly and make sure add Radius 2 is not

1072
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:10,600
busted Adam radius to doesn't look busted.

1073
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,000
Wait, that's the wrong one though.

1074
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,100
There is that Radius 2 minus the radius.

1075
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,800
A Max Plus looks pretty reasonable and made some region.

1076
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,700
See here begins Sam.

1077
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,300
Update.

1078
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,600
Safety margin.

1079
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,300
Add videos to soon as the max entity radius looks like it's still

1080
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,400
handling all of those bounds properly.

1081
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,700
So I feel like what we should probably do is just draw this as well,

1082
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,700
right, just to see why we're getting that kind of different Behavior

1083
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,600
happening there.

1084
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,600
So, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to, I'm going to have the

1085
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,900
same region bound since it's stored, right?

1086
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
The bounds are stored in here.

1087
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,800
I'm going to go ahead

1088
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:03,700
And when we push, when we do that, push rectangle outline.

1089
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,300
I'm going to just push all of these, right?

1090
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,800
So we'll do the screen bounds will do the camera bound and M camera

1091
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,200
bounds and M 60 and we'll draw that one.

1092
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,100
I guess it's white.

1093
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:21,400
Let's say let me go ahead down here to where we do the rest of these

1094
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,800
guys.

1095
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,400
There we go.

1096
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:29,800
And then we'll also do see the Sim bounds and the update.

1097
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,100
It'll bounce or sorry, the bounds.

1098
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:36,900
So let's see.

1099
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,400
This guy, I'll be magenta.

1100
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,100
The scabby cyan.

1101
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,200
All right.

1102
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,100
Too many rectangles.

1103
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,700
Too many wrecks, too many wrecks, too many wrecks.

1104
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,800
Too many wrecks.

1105
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,400
Too many wrecks, too many wrecks, too many wrecks.

1106
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,600
So these are actually 3D.

1107
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:13,500
So we want to do xy's on those and then we need that get dim call to

1108
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,200
work on both.

1109
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
We're out of time.

1110
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,700
So this will be the last thing I do on the

1111
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,600
Looks like tangle free so get Max corner.

1112
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,300
Here we go.

1113
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,400
and,

1114
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:34,600
Okay.

1115
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,600
so it looks like we don't have a bug, it looks like it's just that we

1116
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:46,000
can see a little bit further I guess maybe, although

1117
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't know.

1118
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,400
I don't know about that.

1119
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,600
I'm not entirely certain.

1120
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,400
It looks like we don't necessarily have a bug but what, what is the

1121
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,700
cyan bound?

1122
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:03,800
What is r?

1123
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,700
Sy and EM.

1124
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:05,400
Hold on a second.

1125
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,500
I just want to say sorry.

1126
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,200
We'll go to Q&A in just a second camera bounds and M camera bounds in

1127
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,800
meters.

1128
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,100
Oops.

1129
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:29,100
Yeah, yeah, so that one we really don't need to draw because it's

1130
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,000
always just ins.

1131
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,900
He's the only thing that it changes really so we can turn that one

1132
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,200
off.

1133
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,200
The cyan one is the Sim bonds.

1134
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,800
And then the simmer region bounds.

1135
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,200
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

1136
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,400
It seems like it's pulling things in

1137
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,400
It's pulling things in I guess.

1138
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Maybe that's what it's supposed to do.

1139
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,700
We have to take a look at that tomorrow, maybe that's be something we

1140
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,900
look at as you can kind of see it's pulling things in only up to the

1141
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:06,800
Not to the that outer, the actual bounds, that it expanded to.

1142
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,300
But I'm not actually sure why.

1143
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,600
That would be a thought, it was supposed to do all of them essentially

1144
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,100
so because it's actually iterating over the Sim region bounds but the

1145
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:16,800
same region bands that were drawing.

1146
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,300
It doesn't seem to actually pull the stuff in there, and I guess, is

1147
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:27,400
that because we only, we only actually use the updatable bounds to

1148
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,300
pull stuff in.

1149
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,400
I'm not sure,

1150
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,400
I think we basically got, we've got some bugginess in here.

1151
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,000
Is I guess what?

1152
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,400
I would say, let's see what Adam 2D does.

1153
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,200
It does add into the overlap restaurant.

1154
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,400
Updatable bounds.

1155
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,800
It pulls it in if it's updatable but it pulls it in either way.

1156
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:53,100
So I feel like I just feel like something is afoot.

1157
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:57,200
They're Sim Collision total volume.

1158
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,000
That's

1159
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,100
That's what is this?

1160
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,800
What?

1161
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,700
Total volume Sim region bounds if entity overlaps rectangle.

1162
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,800
Overlaps rectangle.

1163
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,500
Let's see.

1164
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:20,000
Add radius to volume D dim.

1165
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,100
and then,

1166
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,800
He's in rectangle P grown.

1167
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,500
Volume to offset p.

1168
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,300
Huh, it just feels, it feels like that's a bug.

1169
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,800
So I want to take a look at that battle.

1170
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,500
I guess we will start with tomorrow although maybe we shouldn't bother

1171
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,600
playing with this stuff right now because we don't really need to but

1172
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,200
it might be nice.

1173
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,700
I mean when you find a bug you should fix it.

1174
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:52,900
That's my general opinion.

1175
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:57,400
so,

1176
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,800
Any overlaps rectangle.

1177
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:05,600
I just feel like there's a little bit of a bug situation going on

1178
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,300
there, because it feels to me, like, it should be extending all the

1179
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:12,800
way out to the purple region and it's not.

1180
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,400
Now it could be, you know what, it could be.

1181
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,000
It could be that we're too high up.

1182
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,700
It's that because those are on the lower level, I guess maybe that's

1183
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,300
what it is.

1184
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,500
That's a little closer.

1185
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:29,400
Although I'm its now, I'm on that level and we're still not really

1186
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,000
extending.

1187
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,800
So,

1188
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,400
Yeah.

1189
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,800
I mean it could be right but it just feels it.

1190
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,500
Just feels a little off to me.

1191
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,500
So we'll have to we'll have to see what's going on there.

1192
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,300
It's close to right, but it's not quite right.

1193
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,300
All right, so let me go ahead and close this down.

1194
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,200
We'll go ahead over to the Q&A.

1195
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,600
Let me check out our M to pixel situation here or rather I should

1196
01:02:59,600 --> 01:02:59,800
start.

1197
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,800
Whole situation.

1198
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:07,300
So now we're literally only doing this for, you know, for some of, for

1199
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,300
just this world chunk situation.

1200
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,500
That's about it.

1201
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,000
There's really nothing else going on with it and.

1202
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:17,900
Yeah.

1203
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:21,200
So we're getting real close to having this be pretty clean.

1204
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,300
We're not quite there yet, but we're getting close.

1205
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:28,200
So, let's go ahead to the Q&A, like so, there we go.

1206
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,700
so, if you have a question,

1207
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,100
You should type it in now with q:.

1208
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,000
Let's see.

1209
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,900
Will the too many wrecked song be on the soundtrack album?

1210
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,800
I do not suspect so because I suspect that would be some copyright

1211
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,900
infringement since.

1212
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,200
I don't know if you know this, but I did not come up with that

1213
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,200
particular Melody.

1214
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,200
Robot chocolate Dino.

1215
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,700
Should the m 2 pixels value?

1216
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:16,100
Take the pixel density of the monitor into account.

1217
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:22,200
So it is taking the pixel density of the monitor into account, right?

1218
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,200
I think maybe what you meant to ask was, should it take the actual

1219
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,300
physical size of the monitor into account?

1220
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,700
And the answer there is not really because unless we actually know how

1221
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,000
far the person with sitting, well, I'll explain this.

1222
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,300
I'll explain this in detail because it's a reasonable question.

1223
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,100
I want to make sure that it's clear to everyone.

1224
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,900
Why it's happening the way that it's happening.

1225
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,900
So let's take a look at what these how these values are set here,

1226
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,500
right?

1227
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,100
No.

1228
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:56,500
Yeah.

1229
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,800
So here's how we're parameterizing things at the moment, right?

1230
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,500
Here is some slice of the world, right?

1231
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,500
This is world.

1232
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
Here's the camera, like we drew before.

1233
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:15,600
so,

1234
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,600
And here's the screen, right?

1235
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:20,500
This is the monitor.

1236
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,800
Now, what we need to be able to do is set up a typical size for this

1237
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,200
thing.

1238
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,100
Meaning how far away is the camera from the monitor, meaning the, I

1239
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,600
essentially the viewer and how big is the monitor.

1240
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,600
Now, it doesn't matter if that is any particular.

1241
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,400
Set up that a user might actually do it only matters that it is

1242
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,500
reasonable, right?

1243
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,700
It matters that it is something like what?

1244
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:50,500
The user might do.

1245
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,000
Because there's multiple ways that the user might actually view this,

1246
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:54,400
right?

1247
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,400
They might be sitting in their living room, looking at a giant, you

1248
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,800
know, maybe they're looking at some 90 inch plasma TV.

1249
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,700
Right.

1250
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,400
And so they're over here, you know, this is where they're sitting so

1251
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,200
they're basically, you know, the right size for this thing would be I

1252
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,900
don't know how big these things are across.

1253
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,600
I don't know, something like 70 inches or something like this.

1254
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,400
The right sizes for these things, maybe 70 inches across and they're

1255
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,900
sitting like you know six feet away or something right.

1256
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,600
That might be one valid set of parameters but another one might be

1257
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,500
there like at a desk, right?

1258
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,800
Which is what I was thinking more like and so it's like 25 inches

1259
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
across and there.

1260
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,900
Like right up next to it, right?

1261
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:35,100
So this distance is only like you know, half a foot or two feet.

1262
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,700
I think is what I said, right stuff like this.

1263
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,900
Now, the idea is as long as you pick one that's an actual fairly

1264
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,400
typical setup, the setups for how people might view, things don't

1265
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,400
really change that much, they just scale up or down, right?

1266
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,400
But this is basically the same as this just with a bunch of scale put

1267
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,300
in it, right?

1268
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,800
It's scaled up this distance and it scaled up the size, right?

1269
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,400
The same is true as if they were looking at a tablet that they were

1270
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,500
holding in their hands, right?

1271
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,700
The tablet is smaller but the distance is smaller.

1272
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,600
And so, basically, as long as we just set up something reasonable, our

1273
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,300
perspective will be close enough to what the user is probably doing

1274
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,300
with the size of their device and where they are, that it'll be okay,

1275
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,200
right?

1276
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,400
Because again, all it does is control the amount of perspective

1277
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,700
foreshortening that we have.

1278
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,100
So we're just trying to make sure that we come from real-world value

1279
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,300
so that they're not completely ridiculous, right?

1280
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,200
So, what we are, parameterizing it on again is just saying, how many

1281
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,300
pixels across would?

1282
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,200
We be, you know, how much, how many pixels across are?

1283
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,500
We in our current resolution and we're assuming essentially,

1284
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,300
That whatever that's going to be.

1285
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,200
We want that to come out to be

1286
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:52,800
It was like a trance.

1287
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,600
What was I saying there?

1288
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,200
I totally forgot.

1289
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,700
We want that to come out to be something reasonable, right?

1290
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,200
So that's how that works, but what we don't actually have yet, right?

1291
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:15,800
Is we don't actually have this, this width of monitor notion I suppose

1292
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,000
coming from any place real, right.

1293
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,100
We don't actually have any way that that's actually being specified.

1294
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:28,100
And so, what we will want to do, you know, I guess what we'll want to

1295
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,000
do is to try to

1296
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:34,800
You I don't know bake that out into a value so that we don't have to

1297
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,700
worry about it anymore or something like that.

1298
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,300
I mean, I guess I'm not sure.

1299
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:46,500
I mean, I guess what I'm saying is I just kind of picked values that I

1300
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,200
thought would be reasonable because they control the perspective

1301
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:52,500
foreshortening and I don't, I guess I'm trying things, I don't really,

1302
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:56,399
I'm not really trying to capture what the actual width and resolution

1303
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,399
of the, or with the actual width of the monitor is in the actual real

1304
01:08:59,399 --> 01:08:59,700
world.

1305
01:08:59,700 --> 01:08:59,800
I'm

1306
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,100
Using a typical one.

1307
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:08,300
And so what will happen is, you know, ideally if the resolution of the

1308
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:15,899
pixels goes up right, then what happens is, we end up, we end up doing

1309
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:18,000
a wider projection, right?

1310
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,500
But that's what we want.

1311
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,899
And so the question you are asking is what happens when the monitor

1312
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:24,200
resolution is denser.

1313
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,200
That is exactly what this value is.

1314
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,899
Supposed to handle, right?

1315
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,899
So if you look at what it comes out to be,

1316
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,399
at the moment and I guess let me go ahead and make it so that our

1317
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,000
render camera and our debug camera, the same at the moment,

1318
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,300
So if you look at what this looks like, we can fit one screen on.

1319
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:42,899
Right.

1320
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,800
And ideally, if I haven't totally messed something up, which I may,

1321
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,800
well, have, if we want to, we can go in and change.

1322
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,400
Whatever the resolution is Hoops, that the calling code is asking us

1323
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,200
to provide, right?

1324
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,000
And that should not change things at all.

1325
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,600
44, is that, okay?

1326
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,500
So if I change up to 1920 by 1080, at least, hopefully we still get

1327
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:06,700
rough.

1328
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,300
Same thing, right?

1329
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,900
And you can see that it it's the same exact screen, right?

1330
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,000
And the reason again for that it's not quite exactly right?

1331
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,500
Because it's a little too wide at the moment that 1920 by 1080, a

1332
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:22,800
little bit too big.

1333
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,200
But it's almost exactly correct, right?

1334
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,500
If that makes sense.

1335
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,700
So anyway, what I'm just what I'm trying to get across there is the

1336
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:38,200
change in resolution is automatically sort of handled by the way, that

1337
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,600
we've structured, those equations.

1338
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,200
Because words are M pixels here.

1339
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:54,400
Because as the resolution increases, we will increase, it will control

1340
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,400
how proportionally we increase the size of the things we project, so

1341
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,300
we don't want to, if what you were asking is, why don't we correct for

1342
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:02,600
that here?

1343
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,200
We don't want to correct for increases in resolution of the monitor.

1344
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,900
We want to allow increases resolution.

1345
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,800
The monitor to expand the size of the things that we draw on the

1346
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,600
screen because that's what keeps us resolution independent.

1347
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,500
So that's why with of Monitor and and

1348
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,900
Go length, right?

1349
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,600
I mean, you can basically think of focal length and width of monitor.

1350
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,500
In fact, I'll put them right next to each other.

1351
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,500
You can think of the width of the Monitor and the focal length as

1352
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,600
being the two things that we're sort of picking from a typical

1353
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,800
real-world scenario.

1354
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,900
And they create a universal ratio that divides out into just what we

1355
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,400
use for our projection in such a way that we know now, no longer care,

1356
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,800
how big the actual monitor is, or how far away the actual user is

1357
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,400
sitting from,

1358
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,000
MIT.

1359
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,900
It will always give us the same perspective foreshortening, right?

1360
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:57,800
It's fixing the perspective, foreshortening of the game to a typical

1361
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,400
scenario.

1362
01:11:59,500 --> 01:11:59,800
and so,

1363
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,800
We don't want to do is then re correct it based on the pixel density

1364
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,700
because if we were to correct it based on a pixel density, then we

1365
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,200
would no longer be resolution independent.

1366
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,500
So we want to let the pixel density, increase the size of the

1367
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:17,500
projected things on the screen because that's exactly what we want to

1368
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:17,900
happen.

1369
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,200
When we have more density, is to just get more pixels for the same

1370
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,500
size thing in the world, right?

1371
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,300
That was a really bad explanation, but hopefully, eventually it kind

1372
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,400
of made some sense.

1373
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,900
Are you sure the camera should be

1374
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,400
Looking down perpendicular to the levels wouldn't the perspective art

1375
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:32,900
work out better.

1376
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,500
If you said the camera was at an angle?

1377
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,800
No, because II don't want the user to.

1378
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,100
I want this to be a game where the user can count on Motion in the 2D

1379
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:48,800
plane to look 2D and not have their be like distant movement in the

1380
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,000
distance moves, less horizontally than in the foreground, right.

1381
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,600
I don't want them to to do that back projection.

1382
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,700
Can you please toss u and v into V 2?

1383
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,000
Sure.

1384
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,200
You're just, you just wants.

1385
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,700
This sort of thing.

1386
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:20,600
We can definitely do that and we could also if you wanted and here too

1387
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:25,300
we could just go ahead and do you DW like that?

1388
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,100
And and similarly we could make those buv.

1389
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,700
Do it like this.

1390
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,900
Ew, there you go.

1391
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,300
That helps

1392
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,600
Garland of Zoom, we will know exactly how far away they are sitting.

1393
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,000
If they have properly purchased their handmade hero branded Microsoft

1394
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,500
registered trademark hololens.

1395
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,900
That's a very good point.

1396
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,600
As, you know, handmade hero is all about co-marketing opportunities,

1397
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:01,900
right?

1398
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,900
We're not at all about education or trying to do a good thing.

1399
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,200
We are about trying to make as much money as possible.

1400
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,000
So, selling out to Microsoft like certain people do, who will remain

1401
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,100
nameless is exactly what we're going to.

1402
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:21,500
Do as soon as we get the opportunity and the hololens is a perfect

1403
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,800
opportunity for us to do that.

1404
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,100
Now, of course that's all joking.

1405
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:34,600
The actual truth though, there's actually a non joke, important thing

1406
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,900
kind of encoded in that and I don't know if this is why Matthew ask

1407
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,400
this question or not, but it's a good point.

1408
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,400
So I'm going to go ahead and address it.

1409
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,000
Which is to say that.

1410
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:53,600
It's a very good it's now that you've seen me work through it, right?

1411
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,800
And you've seen me go okay, in order to figure out what these

1412
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,400
parameters should be, if we were really basing them on physical

1413
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,800
things.

1414
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,600
Right?

1415
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,100
We should know stuff like how far you are from the camera, right?

1416
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,800
In all that stuff.

1417
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,600
When you want to create a name, truly immersive 3D experience, like a

1418
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,000
VR Helmet or an AR helmet tries to do, right?

1419
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,600
And everything has to be right.

1420
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,100
It has to look binocular.

1421
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,800
It has to when you turn around, it has to move properly.

1422
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,700
It's all got to look correct or you will vomit.

1423
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Suddenly you need all of these values to be accurate, right?

1424
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,100
You need all of these things to be correct.

1425
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:35,800
And so one of the big kind of failures of the way.

1426
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,300
Modern devices work is they don't report any of these values to you.

1427
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,300
There is no calibration when a user sets up their workstation that

1428
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,700
says, how far away from the monitor they are.

1429
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:49,900
So we can't do accurate transforms that look comfortable to them, from

1430
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:50,600
where they're sitting.

1431
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:51,300
It's a bummer.

1432
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,600
But with 3D headsets and stuff they have had

1433
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,400
Start to do this.

1434
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,300
And so one of the things you'll see if you crack open.

1435
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:03,100
An SDK that's designed for use with 3D head-mounted displays, you will

1436
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,600
get all of this information.

1437
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,400
You will know, exactly how far away the lenses are from the eye.

1438
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,500
You will know how far the screen is away from the lens.

1439
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,000
You will know how much Distortion there is.

1440
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,400
You will know the binocular, offset, all of that stuff is actually

1441
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,400
told to you and then, you can feed them into equations.

1442
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:23,200
Just like the one we were doing to actually create an exactly correct

1443
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,500
projection that works.

1444
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,000
With the head-mounted display.

1445
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
So that's pretty cool.

1446
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,800
And it's worth thinking about the fact that what we just did and the

1447
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,900
fact that we were using real world units there that actually becomes

1448
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:38,000
something you do directly with something, like a 3D head-mounted

1449
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,400
display SDK because you need to get all these things.

1450
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,000
Correct.

1451
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,300
You can't fudge them anymore.

1452
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,400
They've got to be exact and that is what you will see when you crack

1453
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
open one of those sdks

1454
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,700
Water lime on is real 32 ambiguous because it could either be floating

1455
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,900
point or fixed point.

1456
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,900
It is ambiguous a very much so it's a 32-bit real.

1457
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,800
But actually, we don't care so much whether it's floating point or

1458
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,000
fixed.

1459
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,100
Point is the way I might say real 32 is what I use in my code to talk

1460
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,800
about the case where I just want to represent a 32-bit value as a real

1461
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:15,700
right?

1462
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:19,000
And actually I don't care how it's being represented.

1463
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,700
So if for some reason and as you know, some underlying

1464
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:26,000
Being wanted to swap out something other than IEEE floating-point

1465
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,700
that's actually.

1466
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,200
Okay.

1467
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:28,700
That makes sense.

1468
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,000
So ambiguities actually fine.

1469
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,600
Is the non smooth movement at higher Zoom levels due to not being

1470
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,900
optimized or some sort of issue with sub-pixel smooth as it's not

1471
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,700
being optimized?

1472
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,100
That's, that's pretty much.

1473
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,300
It's just because it has film or pixels and we don't we're not fast

1474
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,200
enough per pixel right now.

1475
01:17:59,200 --> 01:17:59,800
Because we're really

1476
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
They really, really really optimized in that renderer.

1477
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:11,400
Would it look different if you scale with of Monitor and focal lengths

1478
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,100
together?

1479
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,000
Constrain to the same ratio?

1480
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:14,700
Well,

1481
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:20,000
I'm tempted to leave that as an exercise for the reader because

1482
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,900
here is your similar triangle right here is the focal length.

1483
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Here is the width.

1484
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,600
So you tell me if I was to scale them up by the same ratio.

1485
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,100
Would that change the projection?

1486
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:49,900
Right.

1487
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,400
We'll leave that as an exercise.

1488
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,900
You can you can kind of see how this would go, right?

1489
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,100
I'll walk you through it a little bit.

1490
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,600
So the width of the monitor, right?

1491
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,300
If we assume that the resolution pixels x is constant.

1492
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,600
So we're saying for a, for a given size Monitor and we say that we've

1493
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:16,100
got the, the with of monitor that were actually scaling it up, right?

1494
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:25,100
So if we were to say that we are essentially increasing the focal

1495
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:30,100
length but also increasing the size proportional to it.

1496
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,800
Then how would that affect the ratio of how far we project things on

1497
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,000
here, right?

1498
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,000
And hopefully you can see that it's not going to change that line,

1499
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,000
right?

1500
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:48,800
But again I'll leave that, I leave that sort of as an exercise for you

1501
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:49,800
to go work out.

1502
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,400
Could you put a slider for the user to change their distance to the

1503
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,500
camera at the start of the game?

1504
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,100
Like some games?

1505
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:01,900
Do with gamma?

1506
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,000
Yes you could.

1507
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:09,200
And in fact, I've made programs that work this way before I won't talk

1508
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:13,500
too much about those because I may actually ship them someday, but

1509
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,900
basically they're like I have done stuff before which actually has a

1510
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:18,500
calibration.

1511
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,000
That's like how far away are you sitting?

1512
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,000
And I do a bunch of stuff.

1513
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:27,400
I actually look at the real size of the Monitor and figure out some

1514
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:33,200
stuff like how big Tech should be on the screen based on how much our

1515
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,400
kit should subtend, in your view for Optimal Reading and stuff like

1516
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:35,800
that.

1517
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,600
All right, so it looks like we're about done.

1518
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't see any more cues.

1519
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:56,500
I don't see any more cues so I think we are done.

1520
01:20:57,900 --> 01:20:59,800
All right, let's go ahead and see.

1521
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:00,700
Eve.

1522
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:14,700
Go ahead and save, leave that in there so that we can play with that

1523
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:19,100
tomorrow and see if I want to see if maybe there's some explanation

1524
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:22,400
for that sort of weird.

1525
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,400
Situation there.

1526
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,600
It's kind of fun further.

1527
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,100
I mean it's going to get to one of these.

1528
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,500
It's going to get to a bad point.

1529
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,600
I think not for a little while.

1530
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,300
Like you know, I think we probably got another month or two where it's

1531
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,400
fine but eventually we're gonna get to the point where I'm enjoying

1532
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,400
like moving the guy around and fighting and stuff and then it's going

1533
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,100
to be really annoying because everyone's going to be watching the

1534
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,100
stream and being like,

1535
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,900
Stop just running.

1536
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,300
You're the dude around and playing the game like go back to

1537
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,800
programming or whenever you get this done and I'm going to have to

1538
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,400
worry about that.

1539
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,600
But anyway anyway, I'm gonna leave it like that.

1540
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:02,100
That's a good place to leave it.

1541
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,200
Pick it back up tomorrow.

1542
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,100
Okay everyone.

1543
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,500
Thank you so much for joining me for another episode of handmade hero

1544
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,400
is a pleasure coding with you.

1545
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:12,100
As always, it feels good to have our projection nail down a little bit

1546
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:15,600
more into be based off real world values and we kind of got everything

1547
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,300
into a much more comfortable place.

1548
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,600
I think tomorrow, it's probably time to tackle ground chunks because

1549
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,400
that's our last place where we're kind of not really thinking through

1550
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,000
how big things should be pixel wise and M wise and stuff like this.

1551
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,200
So, and that'll also, I think that'll probably give us a chance to

1552
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,000
expand ours.

1553
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:38,400
Handling out, one more level so that we can actually start to now have

1554
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,300
ground that is properly cashed at different heights, and all these

1555
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,000
sorts of stuff.

1556
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,600
So I think that's the next obvious thing to do.

1557
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,700
It's a good thing to do, and we should do it.

1558
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,200
So that's what we'll do tomorrow.

1559
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,800
I hope you'll come back and join me.

1560
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,600
Same time, same place, 5 p.m.

1561
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Pacific Standard time tomorrow on Twitch.

1562
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,900
I hope to see you all here.

1563
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,000
In the meantime, if you would like to follow along at home, we do have

1564
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,000
a pre-order on the handmade here at org website, if you preorder

1565
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:05,600
Order the game.

1566
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,800
You get the source every day after I finish coding.

1567
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,100
So you can play around with it at home, which is great way to learn

1568
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:10,300
from it.

1569
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,500
If you want to check that out.

1570
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,100
We also have a patreon page, want to support the video series.

1571
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,200
You can always subscribe to that.

1572
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,600
It's very much appreciated.

1573
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,100
We also have a forum site where you can go to ask questions and

1574
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:21,400
there's some stuff on there like pork to Linux and mac and anti-that

1575
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,900
pisode guy just good stuff.

1576
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,500
If you're interested and finally we have a tweak, but tweets, whatever

1577
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:29,100
the days scheduled start time is if you want to catch the stream live,

1578
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,200
that's the way to do it.

1579
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,800
Just check out, check out the tweetbot either.

1580
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,900
Subscribe to it or just check it periodically to see.

1581
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,100
What the schedule is.

1582
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:37,800
