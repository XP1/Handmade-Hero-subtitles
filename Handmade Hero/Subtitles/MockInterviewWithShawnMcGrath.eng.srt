1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Okay.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,700
And welcome to a special edition of handmade hero today.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,900
My my very special guest is Sean McGrath who many of you already know

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,600
because he does programming streams as well.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,800
That you've probably watched essentially what we're doing today is a

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,200
while, back on handmade hero.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,900
And I to be honest, have completely forgotten, the reason, it

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,600
initially came up because it I think it came up even before,

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,700
potentially we did the the career story straight.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,800
So my temptation is to say it was part of the career story stream but

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,800
in reality I think it came up before that I was talking about how the

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,900
interview process at tech companies, is not something that I

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,700
particularly agree with personally, and I was trying to explain how a

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,100
fellow named Chris Hecker, who is actually the primary developer on

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,300
game, called spy party which you may have heard of.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,600
But he's had he's been in the industry.

18
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,600
A long time, he worked at Microsoft did win, G back in the day.

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,900
And he did the the animation system and the creature, morphology

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,400
system for Spore, which is pretty awesome Tech if you've never seen

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,600
it.

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,600
So he actually has an interview process that he taught me and that I

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,500
think is is really, really good.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,900
You know, I can't say one way or another, what the perfect interview

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,900
process is but it certainly struck me as an interview process, that is

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,600
dramatically better than what, you know, people tend to use today.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,900
When you see, how Tech interviews are conducted and how sort of, like

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,000
companies like Google, or Facebook, or this Microsoft conduct their

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,500
interviews.

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,000
And so what I wanted to sort of get across, was how that interview

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,100
process worked and on the stream.

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,000
Sean actually said, hey if you want to do it I'll just pretend to be

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,600
an interviewee and you can pretend to be the interviewer and you can

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,600
do the interview and so people can see how it's done and that's like

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
that sounds awesome.

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,600
Now unfortunately.

37
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
You know, I'm not Chris.

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:10,699
So I'm probably not as good at it as, you know, as patient zero but I

39
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,300
probably good enough at it, that you should be able to see how it goes

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,300
and kind of see.

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,500
Oh, okay, I get it, I get how to do this and it does require a little

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,900
bit of practice on the part of the interviewer, but that's how it

43
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,200
goes.

44
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,700
So first of all, Shawn, thanks so much for being with us, bro.

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,500
You have said you've got a sore throat today.

46
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,200
So I apologize for for, for

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
That we're putting putting extra strain on your voice, but this is,

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
this has been a months-long struggle, so, it's okay.

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,700
It's the wintertime, right?

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,800
That's, that's how that is in Canada, in Canada, in Canada.

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,500
How deep into Canada?

52
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,100
Are you Sean?

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,500
I don't know.

54
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,400
I've sent Toronto.

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,100
It's not that, okay?

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
So you're not that deep.

57
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,900
I remember further south than you are, but it's way colder.

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,200
Okay.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Yeah, because we've got the weird temperature inversion here, or

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
whatever nonsense you've got the Pacific Ocean.

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,600
Okay, well, so let me just say a quick thing about the interview and

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,800
then we'll sort of pretend to

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Started.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm going to try and start at about 11:30.

65
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,900
So, the idea behind this interview is sort of to correct some of the

66
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,200
problems with the standard interview process that you see in Tech.

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,200
And one of the things that you typically see in Tech interviews is

68
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,500
programmers, are given like a programming problem of some kind, or a

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,200
tech problem of some kind, or a brain, teaser of some kind.

70
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,200
And you've probably seen this sort of thing, mentioned a lot,

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,100
discussed a lot online.

72
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,000
There are books now that you know, purport to train you or

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or, or show you the kinds of programming puzzles that you might face

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,200
if you are going to try to get a programming job.

75
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,600
And that's very endemic to have the programming industry at large.

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,500
Kind of does these sorts of interviews and just personally and also I

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,600
think other people probably can attest to who've gone through these

78
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,000
interview process has a really big problem with this is that it has

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,100
nothing to do with the act of programming.

80
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,800
And you know you may say well it's a programming problem.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,300
Really has some into the act of programming.

82
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,400
But what I mean to say is the fundamental construct of coming into

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,600
someone's office that you've never met before being presented, a

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,500
relatively potentially depending on the, on the circumstance or

85
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,200
potentially tricky, programming puzzle.

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,399
And being asked to solve it on the spot is nobody's job in Tech,

87
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,000
right?

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,200
That is not something that you ever do day-to-day.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,200
A programmers job is a marathon, not a Sprint.

90
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,800
You spend many hours programming.

91
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,600
The most problems of any non-trivial nature.

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,500
You will spend many hours, acquainting yourself with first becoming

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,700
comfortable with the concepts reading about what other people have

94
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,000
done in that area, forming opinions about what might be the right ways

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,200
to approach it experimenting with the code and whether or not a

96
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,400
particular programmer, can solve a puzzle in 30 minutes is kind of

97
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
irrelevant to whether they'll do a good job on a programming problem

98
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,100
given a week or two which is what you actually care about in the job.

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,800
And so the big

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
Problem with the way that programming interviews are conducted, is

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,700
they focus very much on this and it's inherently kind of an

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
adversarial process.

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,700
You're giving someone a puzzle you know the answer.

104
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,500
They don't you are forcing them in an already pressure or situation to

105
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,000
perform Under Pressure pressure that will not be there in their actual

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,300
job they will not have you hovering over them when they're attempting

107
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,700
to solve a programming problem.

108
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,800
They may be someone who's very nervous by nature and this may make it

109
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
very difficult for them to concentrate.

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:29,800
They may

111
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,000
may be self-conscious about their own programming ability, even though

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
they may be very good, they may still be self-conscious and this will

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,400
affect their ability to solve the problem in the search situation

114
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,100
where they feel like they're being tested.

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,800
So there's all of these things that kind of conspire to really, I

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,300
think produce unfair results in the process and that's not just a

117
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,700
problem.

118
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,100
For the person interviewing, who will get unfairly potentially

119
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,500
rejected from a job even though they might have been the best person

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,300
for that job.

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,900
But it also hurts the hiring side because you may be turning away.

122
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,400
Lots of people who would have been great at your company and very good

123
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,600
at what you needed them to do, simply because their personality, or

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
their mental state.

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,800
At the time is not up to the task of solving, these pinpoint pressure

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,000
kind of problems.

127
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,700
And so, what this interview is designed to do is to sort of get past

128
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,300
that as the Central Way at this essential turning point of a

129
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
Job interview and try to turn it into something more friendly and

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
comfortable.

131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,100
So that the programmer isn't constantly aware of this pressure and to

132
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
maybe get them out of that head space so that they can behave more

133
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,200
like they would in the real work environment which is, I think a

134
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,700
fairer test of their ability.

135
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,900
So that's all I wanted to say is the preamble.

136
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
And I also, again, apologize.

137
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,400
If I don't do the best job on this maybe someday Chris, Hecker will

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,300
demonstrate it on History, he streams occasionally, maybe he would

139
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,900
stream one where he would interview somebody.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,600
And he can correct any mistakes that I make here.

141
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,000
But there we go.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,500
So,

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Without further Ado, let's we're going to pretend that Sean and I

144
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,900
don't know each other even though we do and we're also going to

145
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,400
pretend that I haven't ever seen him stream code.

146
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,600
So I'm going to pretend I don't have any knowledge of anything that

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,300
he's done and I'm going to have to get all of that information out of

148
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,800
the interview myself.

149
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,100
Alright Sean you ready?

150
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,500
Let's do it.

151
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,100
Okay.

152
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,700
So, hey Sean, thanks for coming in today.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,500
How how, how you been how's it going?

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,700
I have been great other than my sore throat.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,800
How are you?

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm pretty good.

157
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm pretty good.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,300
I feel like for whatever reason Saturdays, I sometimes have trouble

159
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,500
getting up in the morning at the time that I should.

160
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,800
So, I've got some coffee here, I hope it's going to kick in.

161
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,100
If I seem a little bit Dopey, that's not representative or a company

162
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,500
that's representative of the earliness.

163
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
So I apologize up front for that.

164
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,300
Are same because I stayed up until 6:00 in the morning playing DOTA.

165
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,100
So, how often do you like Toda?

166
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh yeah.

167
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,600
I mean, I assume if you stayed up till 66 playing it.

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,200
Oh, yeah.

169
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
Well, six of the morning my time that's only like, 3 or X.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,200
So, so do you are you like a fan of online games in general or mobas

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,700
in general?

172
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,500
Or do you like is that?

173
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,400
Is that like an anomaly?

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Because sometimes Dota or League of Legends like an outlier for

175
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,600
people.

176
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,400
Yeah.

177
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,300
I know I'm a big fan of Esports, I followed the Korean esport scene

178
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,500
since the late.

179
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,400
90s.

180
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,900
Oh wow.

181
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,200
And I've just sort of been enthralled by that but by the idea of the

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,799
sort of they're not really games at that level, like they're no longer

183
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,600
a breakdown, the video game part of it and become like this, almost

184
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,000
like mental chess with crazy reflect sort of like one-on-one

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
experience that I really enjoy watching.

186
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,300
So I've been a fan of that and I think DOTA is currently although

187
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,000
Starcraft.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,100
Good work has come back, thankfully in Korea, but I think DOTA is sort

189
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
of the Pinnacle of that at the moment.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,900
What the, what got you into Korean Esports that early because I feel

191
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,300
like, you know, a lot of people probably work.

192
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,900
Well, you know, in the late 90s, I think a lot of people probably

193
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,700
weren't aware of that scene at all, or, you know, kind of what even

194
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,400
the gaming scene was like, in Korea, if they weren't from, you know,

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that country or thereabouts?

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, I don't know.

197
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I've always been a competitive person, so I

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,100
I played lots of sports when I was a kid.

199
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,500
And then when I was 12 or 13, I got an approach when I was 12 or 13.

200
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,000
I got into programming and I started making video games and that's

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,800
what sort of got me into video games.

202
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,300
And I just, I didn't have time for sports anymore because all I was

203
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,100
doing this programming.

204
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,100
So I had to get like something or playing games and programming.

205
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,200
So I had to get like some sort of competitiveness out, so I started

206
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,600
playing video games competitively and at the time Warcraft 2 was sort

207
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
of the most viably.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Viably competitive game and then Starcraft came out.

209
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,100
So I was playing that.

210
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,100
And then I found out about, I found out that some shoe company was

211
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,900
making Starcraft shoes in Korea, no way.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like in like, 1998 or 1999 and like now that doesn't seem like a big

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,800
deal but like 20 years ago.

214
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,900
Yeah, video game branded shoes, that's crazy.

215
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,100
That would never happen here.

216
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,700
So I was like in Korea, there they go, crazy for this.

217
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,400
This is interesting, right?

218
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,800
So start doing a little bit of research on Korea and Esports and that

219
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
was when French

220
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:37,300
Canadian player named XDS GE GE are are moved from Quebec to Korea to

221
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,300
compete.

222
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,000
And I was like, oh my God, this is crazy.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
So I was like, this is what I want to do.

224
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,200
So then when Warcraft 3 came out.

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,100
I played it so much that I was top 100 in u.s.

226
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,500
East.

227
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,200
Are you thirsty?

228
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,900
Yeah, I was yeah.

229
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,000
So I just, I don't know.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,100
I've just always found.

231
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm really competitive and I really like, I don't really like video

232
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,800
games anymore, but I used to really like video,

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,300
Games and I like programming.

234
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,100
So it's sort of, you know, it's a natural sort of thing.

235
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,900
So, tell me a little bit about that because, like, this is, this is

236
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,900
something that I've never for whatever reason, like, Competitive

237
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Gaming.

238
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
I've almost never gotten into.

239
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,100
I don't that just because I maybe I'm just bad at it.

240
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,400
So I don't like, I'm not as interested in doing because I don't think

241
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,800
I'll be good.

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,500
I'm not sure though.

243
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
I just I've never quite done it.

244
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,300
So like do you generally like, is I feel like looking at your resume

245
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:29,600
here?

246
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Like you

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,700
It doesn't look like you've ever really worked on Esports kind of

248
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
titles is that?

249
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,000
Because you like to keep that separate like you like to kind of have

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,600
Esports as as your recreational activity and you'd rather work on like

251
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,700
single player games or stuff like that.

252
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,200
As the as, you know, the job or is that just circumstantial?

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,100
Like it's like, hey, you know, I I never really had the opportunity to

254
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,200
go work on a Esports title, I was crazy about.

255
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,900
So I didn't and someday.

256
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,500
I'd really like to or like, you know what I mean?

257
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,000
Like, how does that fit in for you?

258
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,800
Yeah, I've sort of like, all the

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,800
I have video games like playing video games is basically gone for me I

260
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,100
don't enjoy certain to do more than I'd like to admit I suppose.

261
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Well it's just like we would need make them for so long.

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,400
Right.

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,000
You see how the sausage is made whenever you play it?

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,100
Whenever I play game all I just see is like 100 suffering people,

265
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,600
right?

266
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,800
So it's kind of like I kind of don't get joy in playing video games

267
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,300
anymore, but I find that the technology and then the technology

268
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,000
requirements and the sort of

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Of.

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,900
Programming ethos that exists in video games is the only one that I'm

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,100
interested in anymore and I still find really interesting problems

272
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,600
that are more or less only available in video games and like the

273
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
programming style that I like is more or less only appropriate to

274
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,600
video game.

275
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,500
So I still really enjoy the technical problems of video games and

276
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
solving those problems but actually playing them.

277
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
That's kind of that's long gone.

278
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,500
So what kind of technical problems are we talking about here?

279
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,000
When you say like the ones in video games versus you know, some other

280
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Kind of kind of thing.

281
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,600
Right?

282
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Like what's an example just so I just just to frame I mean I think I

283
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
can guess but I don't want to put words in your mouth, right?

284
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Like I mean you probably have a very more specific idea of what you

285
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,600
consider.

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,700
An interesting technical problem.

287
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,700
Yeah, I don't know.

288
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,600
It's just like anything that's like, you know, where we actually care

289
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,800
about the resources of the system, and we want to do, take maximum

290
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
advantage of them to, to a point, right?

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like there's, there's crazy optimization stuff that I find

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
interesting, but I'm not

293
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,700
It's not like practical to do that on a wide scale basis, but like,

294
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,800
just generally, like, okay, we have, this is what our Hardware is.

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
How many triangles can be good on the screen.

296
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
How many times can we overdraw pixels on the screen?

297
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,900
How much transparency can we have?

298
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,100
What sort of things can we do in this space?

299
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,900
Like how should we partition our geometry?

300
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,300
How should we tessellate things?

301
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,900
All of these things?

302
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,600
All of these questions are how to maximize, what result we have,

303
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
whatever, we want that result to be, and it's not like, I know like

304
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,200
Facebook or whatever, they're going to be like, well, we can get 1%

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,100
more and of hip-hop video.

306
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,200
Amber whatever, right?

307
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Or and it's like that's just not as interesting of a problem when the

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,700
solution can be just go build a Data Center and he planted up another

309
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,200
degree wherein wherein program where in games it's like no you have

310
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,600
this one x64 thing.

311
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Make a photo realistic screen happen or make a photo realistic image

312
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,900
happen on the screen 90 times a second, right?

313
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,700
Like how do you do that?

314
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,200
Right.

315
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,200
And in that there are tons of little interesting little technical

316
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
problems that I enjoy solving.

317
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:41,900
So, which it looks like you did two major games here, dyad + + + + +.

318
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,900
Yeah, we're there are others that that you enjoy doing those were?

319
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
I mean, did you like those projects?

320
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,500
I guess, I should say like, how did you feel about them?

321
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah.

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,100
Other projects that you that you preferred to those.

323
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,600
That maybe I'm not aware of.

324
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes.

325
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Oh, I've done.

326
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,800
I did the sound effect.

327
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
System for Sound Shapes, as well for the Vita.

328
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,500
And the PS3, I did the backend and part of a scripting language,

329
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,600
implementation and rendering implementation in Flash for an MMO back

330
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
in 2005 or 2006.

331
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,800
So, did the entire back-end for that some of the renderer scripting

332
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,400
language things?

333
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,000
I've done that I've done contract on small contract work like, hey, we

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,100
need to make this load in less than four hours, right?

335
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,800
Stuff like that.

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,800
Door handle.

337
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
We split this geometry upset as faster.

338
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,000
I've had a little contract jobs like that on various projects but

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,700
yeah, the biggest ones are dyad.

340
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,600
I did everything myself.

341
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,300
Except the music which is a lot of work like all the design, all the

342
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,600
art, all about, okay.

343
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,700
Publishing stuff like everything and then n plus plus I just did the

344
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,900
programming so but only on the PS4 version not the PC version which of

345
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,000
those projects was your favorite or it's you did you have a clear

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,400
favorite or did you just kind of like I mean getting some perspective

347
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,700
on them.

348
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Daya

349
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,500
I put I was so burnt out after finishing diet that I didn't play for

350
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,300
three years and then when I did play it, I wish I had like tears about

351
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,600
how much I love about how much I love the game.

352
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,800
It's like my favorite game.

353
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,400
So I love everything about it and I assumed that I was going to hate

354
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,800
it at the end of it because it was such a traumatic experience, right?

355
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,400
And then but when I played it three years later, I was like this is

356
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
the best game I've ever played in my life.

357
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
So I felt really good about that.

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,800
So did

359
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,100
You did you feel like that project is your favorite from a game

360
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,800
playing standpoint and also a technical standpoint or did you feel

361
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
like technically other projects were more interesting and dyad was

362
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,100
more?

363
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,300
Just the end product was, was your favorite?

364
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,200
Like which was your favorite to have done the work for versus to play?

365
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I guess it does that excite?

366
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,900
Say the question?

367
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah, I think one of the so there's a couple of interesting things

368
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,000
that I did in both of those two games will talk about the two games.

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,700
Because the ones that was primarily it all the programming for both of

370
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:58,900
them.

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah.

372
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,800
So

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Dyad it loads about 100 megabytes of text textures and about.

374
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,700
I can't remember 130 megabytes of sound on the PS3 with no load times.

375
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,300
So that was a lot of asset pre-processing and just mapping everything

376
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,000
out into chunks that you just mem copy.

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,900
Basically and then just set the pointers up and what refresh my memory

378
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,200
because well and actually, I shouldn't say refresh my memory.

379
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,700
I never actually ship something for the PS3.

380
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,800
So what

381
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,600
I don't actually know if the PS3, what kind of constraints were on the

382
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,300
load times there?

383
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,500
I mean that's it was this loading from a disk or downloadable it was

384
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,600
downloadable but like it's the harder of super super slow.

385
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Okay.

386
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,900
And it was segmented memory, it will not segmented like the old ways

387
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,600
but it wasn't unified memory where the GPU could access CPU memory.

388
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,100
So there are two separate things but we ran, I ran over the budget on

389
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,600
the, on the CPU side of things.

390
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,800
So I had to chunk some of the sound onto the GPU memory and

391
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
The spu's can read to both.

392
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,000
So there was a lot of, but I choose you talking like eight years ago

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,600
at this point, right?

394
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,300
So but yeah, so there was a lot of that that was interesting, kind of

395
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,900
like

396
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,800
It's kind of dumb work.

397
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,900
Like it's like, oh my God, this is such a stupid constraint, how do we

398
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,900
solve this thing?

399
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
But at the same time it's also like this is kind of an interesting

400
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,800
solution.

401
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,300
Right.

402
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,100
I guess it's kind of an interesting problem of like how do we get this

403
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,300
thing to not have to load?

404
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,100
Okay, so it's a big endian machine.

405
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,200
So you got to put everything you have to do an asset pre-process on

406
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
everything to put it all into big endian.

407
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,600
What if we you know, try different texture compression things.

408
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,700
It's like well, what if instead of texture compressing we just used

409
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
for channels of uncompressed texture and then apply the color to eat

410
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,400
And also, essentially each channel is used as an alpha mask.

411
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
So that was the way I Des texture compression.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,700
So that there was no artifacts around anything.

413
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
So, hold on a second because there's a bunch of stuff in there.

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
I just try to make sure I understand.

415
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,900
So let's starting with the with the loading stuff so basically like

416
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,900
you have to it sounded like you had maybe around 250 megabytes of of

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,500
asset footprint sounded like, you know, it's a little bit more and

418
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,300
more like 300.

419
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,500
Yeah.

420
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,200
Somebody hundred and that it has 512 Megs on the machine.

421
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,700
So yeah.

422
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,200
Is that like the uncompressed footprint doors that the footprint,

423
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
there was no compression, okay, okay.

424
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
So the uncompressed footprint is 300 megabytes.

425
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,600
So once the 300 megabytes is in there were good, but again, we've got

426
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,000
to get it off the hard drive, which is going to take probably at least

427
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
20 30 seconds.

428
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,600
Probably.

429
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't remember what the speed of the hard drive was, but it wasn't

430
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,200
that long, but it was, it was over 10 seconds over 10 seconds.

431
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,800
So, so what was your approach to that?

432
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Tell me like, did you just try to load everything?

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,400
With the background screaming like to get gimme.

434
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
Gimme some idea of what what the approach was.

435
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,100
I mean, so I know it's probably hard to remember, but just so I, yeah.

436
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,500
But basically, it was like, because the lovely levels were fairly

437
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,100
linear.

438
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,000
Yeah, it was.

439
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,100
And there was a lot of assets.

440
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
This was all done manually.

441
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,200
There was a lot of assets that were duplicated across multiple levels,

442
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,400
so they just always stayed loaded, right?

443
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,300
So but that was like a hundred and something MB, okay?

444
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,300
And then there was another 130 another 300 on top of that, okay?

445
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,400
So those three hundred because they were

446
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,700
Linear at the start of the level, or sort of the levels were linear at

447
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
the start of the levels.

448
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,000
You would need, you know, we could figure out what assets, you needed,

449
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
right at the start and we stuck the everything was there were two

450
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:23,900
files.

451
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,300
There was a GPU file to go into the GPU memory and the CPU filed ago,

452
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,600
in the CPU memory, and they were just ordered, like things that you

453
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
needed at the start were used at the start and then there was a thread

454
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
that was just mem, copying everything.

455
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,500
And hopefully, by the time, a pointer needed to be there.

456
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,300
The memory was there, okay?

457
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,700
So tell me a little

458
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
A bit more about this then.

459
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,100
All right.

460
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,800
So so I'm going into well it looks like the start of the startup of

461
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,300
the game needs.

462
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:51,900
I guess.

463
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,300
It sounds like a hundred megabytes or something of 150 megabytes of

464
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,000
startup data.

465
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,300
It sounds like you were sort of saying, how does that get in there or

466
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,800
is that just that happens?

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,900
Bring the save game.

468
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,700
Because on consoles the savegame API, I read this article about etw

469
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,300
being the worst API ever made, and I don't necessarily, but it's not.

470
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,100
Is that what you're saying?

471
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,300
Not its console savegame apis for the worst apis ever made.

472
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,000
Okay, tell me.

473
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,300
Tell me why I, oh, I can't just like the number of asynchronous

474
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,500
things, you have to keep track of and like the number of states that

475
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,800
can just suddenly change and the number of trc's that

476
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,400
Related to save games is just absolutely ridiculous.

477
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,700
Got it.

478
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,700
And you have to mount and unmount things and there's no like there's

479
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,900
no like file replaced, where it automatically makes a backup copy.

480
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,500
So you have to do that manually, okay, then it's okay it's just a it's

481
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,000
an absolute nightmare, right?

482
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,300
And just mounting a savegame like Mount point because I guess they're

483
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,000
chroot adore.

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,600
So I don't know how it works internally.

485
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,900
But like mounting a savegame mount point is like a three-second API

486
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,400
call.

487
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
And then on mounting it

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,800
Have to overlap it because yeah, you can't just sit there for three

489
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,400
seconds going.

490
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Like, hey, do you felt here?

491
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,400
She's immediately?

492
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,600
Right.

493
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Because I think you have like half a second or something where you

494
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,900
screen, doesn't refresh.

495
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,200
Ok.

496
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,900
So it's just awful right?

497
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:18,100
And there's no there's no good like the AP, the asynchronous apis at

498
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
least on the PS3 weren't good.

499
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,600
If I remember like the file IO apis.

500
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay.

501
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,600
There were, there were, yeah, but I never use them.

502
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,700
I just made a thread and did everything manually in a separate thread,

503
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:28,900
right?

504
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,800
So it wasn't like,

505
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,500
Like those like file reading Windows where you pass it the overlap

506
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,600
thing and then just let the OS take care of it.

507
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,800
You manually did the threading.

508
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,600
So it was just like a bunch of dumb stuff.

509
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,700
You always do that at the very end, which makes things extra

510
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,200
frustrating.

511
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,700
So while that was happening, the savegame stuff was happening.

512
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,000
We were able to easily load the hundred Meg's that you would need for

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,600
the whole game.

514
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,500
So because you can save you and I, oh, like you could issue I owe for

515
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,300
the, for the, for the data that you needed and it would be able to

516
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,800
complete in

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Time it took to wait for the savegame Tomato.

518
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,400
Laughs.

519
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,500
Okay.

520
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,400
Yeah, Steve game is like 12 bytes or something like that and it still

521
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,200
took, it took longer to load those 12 B than it did to load, 100

522
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,700
whatever was 96, or 100 Meg's or something like that.

523
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay, so that comes into memory and you've just got it is what you're

524
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,200
saying and I guess is that partitioned as well, you kind of were

525
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,800
talking about the being partitioned between CPU and GPU.

526
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,500
Or how does that work?

527
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,700
It's all CPU memory.

528
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,000
Okay.

529
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,800
So partner Prince Ivan textures, but they're small.

530
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:36,800
All, but then now I go to start playing a level and I'm sort of going

531
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,900
through this level and you said, you've got a background thread going

532
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,700
and you said something about, hopefully the pointers there.

533
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,300
So tell me a little bit.

534
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,100
What is this thread do?

535
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,200
Like it, give me the web.

536
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,100
So if I remember correctly most of the most of the the data was sound

537
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,300
and if you're into jokes because you seemed to be having a good time,

538
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,100
we one of the marketing things that we did for dyad was uncompressed

539
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,300
audio right?

540
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,500
And because

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Files think that he thinks that the cat.

542
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,800
So, all right so we'll let you were like, hey look guys.

543
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,500
Hey look, no compression.

544
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
No audio compression know everything digital artifacts here.

545
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Well, I'll get to that.

546
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,100
All right, we didn't have audio compression only because it loaded

547
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,800
faster, right?

548
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,300
And because all of our sounds we, there were no, there's no music in

549
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,800
diet.

550
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,300
Everything was the stem of all the songs and then I wrote a dynamic

551
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,900
mixer, right?

552
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
So be playing like 30 or 40 Loops at a

553
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,500
Time and like any event that you do in the game with dynamically

554
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,400
change everything right?

555
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,700
Okay.

556
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,500
And so chord changes and stuff like that, we're all manual.

557
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,300
Like we would just swap where what sounds were playing, right?

558
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,600
Okay.

559
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,500
So it was complicated as hell but in order to do that in order to get

560
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,800
the decompression because there's an overhead of decompression with

561
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,500
Agra files when you first start it up, if I remember correctly and

562
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,100
then we couldn't use MP3 because we had to there was a royalty thing

563
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,700
at the time.

564
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,400
Anyway so cool.

565
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
Patent it up until like last year I think yeah.

566
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,500
Stop handed.

567
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,400
So that was a nightmare.

568
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,700
So we were just like screw it screw it.

569
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,200
We can just do it all with just raw PCM data.

570
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,900
So when we were marketing the game we were like hey raw PCM data.

571
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,600
But the sound the original samples that we used were like, 32k MP3s

572
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,500
like they were just terrible, right?

573
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
But like, we uncompressed them for Speed purposes and just told

574
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
everybody it was uncompressed audio, which was totally true.

575
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
So we did all of it, okay?

576
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,000
And people like, on forms were like, man, the audio is uncompressed.

577
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,700
This is so good.

578
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,800
And we're just like a laughing because it's like, yeah, it's Uncle.

579
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,000
Pressed from compressed.

580
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Oh man.

581
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,600
So anyway, so what we would do is at the start of each level, there

582
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,900
would be like a list of, you know, 60 or 70 wav files that we would

583
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,100
use and the memory offset to where they were and we would line them

584
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,500
all up.

585
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,600
So that the first chunk of the memory was music that you needed at the

586
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,500
very start of the game, like the first.

587
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,400
Because like I said, like there were all the cord like we'd have,

588
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
like, seven sounds in a song and there'd be like five chords from

589
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,700
right as this 35.

590
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,900
35 sounds, but we know that we're starting on C major.

591
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
So we put C major first and then we put all the sound effects that are

592
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,100
for C major.

593
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,800
And then we, you know, maybe it goes down A fifth or something like

594
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:09,900
that.

595
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,800
We put that as the next chord, right?

596
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,600
That's just how it all worked, okay?

597
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,000
So we put the first score that you needed first.

598
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,100
And the second chord that you needed first, because the levels were

599
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,600
linear.

600
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:19,900
Yeah.

601
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,400
And then the header of the file was the B offsets to all of the all

602
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,400
the sounds that we needed.

603
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:26,800
Okay.

604
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
And we would just hope that by the time you got to

605
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,400
That part of the song that part of the level that loaded, otherwise,

606
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,700
you hear noise, and it never happened.

607
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,200
So we knew it was fast enough.

608
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,600
So basically you have this table that says, here are the B offsets and

609
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,100
we're going to jump to wherever that supposed to be and I'm going to

610
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,300
start playing that WAV file.

611
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Whatever it is, now, hopefully, the thread.

612
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,500
The background thread has loaded that in by now but maybe it hasn't so

613
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
does the background thread loading in chunks or how is that working?

614
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,800
It was just a mem copy, or it was like a loop.

615
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Them copies over, I don't remember a megabyte, like was a 96.

616
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't remember exactly how it worked, but it was like a loop of mem

617
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,300
copies, would just keep doing it that way would update a progress

618
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,200
indicator of when when something was done.

619
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,300
So, we would know if we ever missed these, we do like mem copy because

620
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,900
it's coming from a hard drive, isn't it?

621
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,900
Yeah you just map the file and then copy.

622
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Oh okay so it's using a memory mapped I/O not like an F, read sort of

623
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,000
style or right.

624
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,400
Right.

625
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Okay.

626
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,800
And I would not, it would go MB out.

627
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,300
A time because I found that to be faster.

628
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,400
Just experimental e.

629
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
Like I do, like, do we map for MB?

630
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,600
We mapped the whole file.

631
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Like, how do we do it?

632
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,900
And then what ended up being fastest?

633
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,400
If I remember correctly, was one megabyte.

634
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,600
But now I'm thinking, I might have been two megabytes whatever it was.

635
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,700
It was, I did a bunch of tests about how much we want to map.

636
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,200
What if we just map the whole file?

637
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,000
And then just do offsets, but that didn't work.

638
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,600
Because the OS scheduler, couldn't predict what it needed in memory

639
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,300
correctly.

640
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,500
If we were jumping around a lot.

641
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,900
So we just member, I just met my map.

642
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,600
What I needed.

643
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,800
I mapped a small chunk of what I need.

644
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,300
And then we just continuously map different parts of the file and then

645
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,200
mem copy it into a fixed chunk of memory.

646
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,900
I see, so basically your original approach was just a memory map, the

647
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,700
file and say, hey, we can just play right out of that, but it was too

648
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,000
much.

649
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,600
Just in time, like, you'd hit it and need it, and the OS wouldn't have

650
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,400
had time to go get it right.

651
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,400
And we, yeah, and like, the OS it's not, it doesn't solve all your

652
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,000
problems, right?

653
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,700
So it doesn't know, it didn't know what we would need it, but we

654
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,100
wouldn't know what we would need.

655
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,500
So we would be able to figure it out, got it?

656
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,300
Okay.

657
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,600
Yeah, like if I could have just memory about the file that would have

658
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,100
been amazing.

659
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Would have been less work.

660
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,000
So.

661
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,000
All right.

662
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,200
So I guess going back to the original question there.

663
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,900
So technically speaking, which of the projects did you think was the

664
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,100
most fun, right?

665
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,400
Was was a diet, everything plus plus you haven't mention a Superman +

666
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,300
+ + + + had a lot of fun, fun things about it.

667
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,000
Regarding the tech that I don't really want to get into, especially on

668
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,400
stream.

669
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,500
But there was an interest, there was a couple of interesting.

670
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,400
There's one interesting thing about the on plus plus Tech which is how

671
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,900
the anti Alias or worked.

672
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,300
Okay.

673
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,800
How do we like to work?

674
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,300
It's a well, it's a line art game, so, because it's a line art game.

675
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,900
We're like, wow, there's a lot of pixels on a screen.

676
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,600
Let's make them as pretty as possible, right?

677
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,900
Because it's just lineart, okay?

678
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,200
But how the anti-alias our work is a little bit of a

679
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,700
It's a little bit insane, okay?

680
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,500
It's every pixel that you every line that's drawn is drawn as either.

681
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,800
It's signed distance field of either a circle Arc or a straight line,

682
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,100
right?

683
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,800
Everything is a circle Arc or straight line.

684
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
So we would draw.

685
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,200
I'm going to do a little Milton business here, good?

686
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah, be great.

687
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,700
All right, so what do we got screen to see?

688
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,700
Okay.

689
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,800
so basically what we were writing Shader that and what you would pass,

690
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,400
The Shader is, you know, P0 and P1, and there's a CPU side, I try to

691
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,100
Geometry Shader, don't you jump at your shaders?

692
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,500
I tried.

693
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,700
So I did this on the CPU side.

694
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,800
We're basically I'd say, I want to draw a line between here and here.

695
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay.

696
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,100
And it would generate a triangle strip, you know, with points like

697
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,700
this or whatever.

698
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,000
Right.

699
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,300
So we generate you know your your six points I tried.

700
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,900
Protects indices to but it was faster to just draw six points.

701
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,300
So it would so you know there was a function that was like draw a line

702
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,400
between here and here, right?

703
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,300
So would draw.

704
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,600
So it figure out what these six points are and draw it, right?

705
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,800
And it would figure these out by two parameters thickness of the line,

706
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,000
right?

707
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,700
So that, you know, you thickness of your line is this, maybe right?

708
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,400
So you want to draw a line that's maybe this thick and everything is a

709
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,600
capsule, not aligned technically rights because it's the signed

710
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,900
distance field so we're going to get in by that to explain what you

711
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,400
mean by signed distance field.

712
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
So signed distance feel well at this

713
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,000
Field is basically a field like a 2d plane or 2D.

714
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:04,900
I guess it could be 3D surface where every point on the surface is a

715
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,500
function.

716
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
That is a distance to something.

717
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,500
So if you have to understand can I mean yeah that dried out here.

718
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:12,800
That's.

719
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,500
So let's do it.

720
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,400
We have this square, right?

721
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,400
This is our field will call this our field.

722
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,100
So you have a circle a circle in the middle, okay?

723
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Each point on this rather than it being whatever you envision a point

724
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,700
to be, it is a function that is a value.

725
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,900
It's a function that you can evaluate each point at to be.

726
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,100
How far am I from this circle, right?

727
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,700
So you could say from this point, the value of this point here, the

728
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,900
value of this field is the distance from here to the the point of this

729
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,800
wouldn't be a circle.

730
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,300
Technically, we just be a point, right?

731
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,900
You have a point at the center so this value here is whatever this

732
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,500
distance here is

733
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,000
Right.

734
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,700
Okay, so this is like a mathematical function.

735
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, it's a function.

736
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,800
What, where is it?

737
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
So what is the function for that?

738
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Look like that you draw on there if you can you know what action for

739
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,800
this?

740
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

741
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,200
Like what's the actual function that we're talking about here?

742
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:11,300
Just so I understand call each of these points Q then we'll call the

743
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,900
your point P, okay?

744
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,200
It would be P minus q and then the length of that which is like p.x.

745
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
Askew dot X.

746
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,100
Squared, the Pythagorean theorem, you know, okis know why.

747
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:33,600
It's basically it's um, yeah, it's just the that's not what it is at

748
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,700
all.

749
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,500
But you know what it is?

750
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,100
Well guys.

751
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,800
I just want to make sure I get it like so so okay.

752
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,300
Yeah.

753
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,500
Can you just write out the function?

754
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,300
So I can see it and that way, when you're talking about the capsule,

755
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,100
one I can look back at it, if that makes sense and no, make the is

756
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,400
equal to P minus Q, which is the vector of that, okay?

757
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,900
And so V Dot V and then the square root of V Dot.

758
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,800
V is

759
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
Give you while you don't actually need the square root.

760
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,100
So V Dot V is going to give you the squared distance from here to here

761
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,000
which is the value of the function, right?

762
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,600
So why why don't you need the square root?

763
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,800
It's just an extra square root that you don't have to calculate like

764
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,300
why evaluate square root if you don't necessarily need it, right?

765
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:30,200
Well I just sorry I just meant like so if I've got this V Dot V and I

766
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,600
and I met just gives you the square so that gives you the squared

767
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
distances if you have 0 squared fall off, right?

768
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,800
So instead of having a linear like if you were to look at the distance

769
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,200
fall-off from the farthest point of the nearest point, right?

770
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,300
If you don't take the square, if you take the square root, you get a

771
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,800
linear.

772
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,200
If you do let's try it this way.

773
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,600
If you do take the square, if you don't take the square root, you get

774
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,900
like a function that looks like this.

775
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
So you technically do need to take the square root, okay?

776
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Because you want to get a linear fall-off, right?

777
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,300
If you're doing I'm gonna explain why hold on.

778
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,400
Let me see if I can explain why.

779
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,600
So the reason why you do this, so if you were to take this and just

780
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,800
look at the function, right?

781
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,100
I'm gonna open Photoshop here.

782
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,800
So in Photoshop, if you were to take

783
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,199
Cake.

784
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,699
Come on, Phil.

785
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Photoshop crashed.

786
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay, that's all right.

787
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,400
So, if you were to take a look at, just what the function look like,

788
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,300
yeah, you'd get something like

789
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,100
Something like that.

790
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,199
So that's going to be what your distance field looks like.

791
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,400
Actually, I guess it would be inverted.

792
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,500
So that's going to be what your distance field looks like, right?

793
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:45,699
So out here in like so like out here, you have a distance of say one

794
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:48,000
because you're going to normalize it, over the area of the thing.

795
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,100
And here you're going to have a distance of zero, right?

796
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:54,699
So using the to normalize it over the area or normalize it over the

797
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,200
half width of the of the square, right?

798
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,800
So if you have a square here and it's this is 512 pixels.

799
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,600
You know that brawl this is going to be square root of 5 12 + 5, 12

800
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,100
squared.

801
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,100
So whatever this distance you, well we'll just use 512 for example,

802
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,200
right?

803
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
Because we're going to treat this as a circle, right?

804
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,900
So if we do that photoshop is not cooperating.

805
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,400
So let's just say, for example, we'll pretend that I drew the

806
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:20,900
centered.

807
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,400
and,

808
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:33,700
and it's stroke to it's in black and I want it in Red, so we'll do

809
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,600
this.

810
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,500
How about cornflower blue?

811
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Well, cornflower blue and some blue here is that corn flour enough for

812
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:43,600
you?

813
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,900
Yeah, it's got to be corporate.

814
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,900
Okay, well, whatever that is, that's what it is, right?

815
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,800
So we're drawing a circle, we're just going to we're going to say that

816
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,500
for sake of argument that this is 512, this is

817
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,500
and 12 pixels.

818
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,600
This is 500.

819
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Can I get the proper?

820
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,400
Button.

821
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,400
All right, so we're going to say this is 512 pixels, right?

822
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay so you would draw a square that's exactly Jesus.

823
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,200
That's exactly 512 pixels.

824
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,500
And then at each point on the Square you compute the distance to say

825
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,000
the center point, right?

826
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,100
So right here and then you divide it by 512 so that you have a

827
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,300
normalized value between 0 and 1, right?

828
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,200
So at this point here, the farthest point on the circle is going to be

829
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,800
distance of 1 and your closest point is going to be a distance is

830
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,700
zero, right?

831
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Doesn't make sense, okay.

832
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,200
Yeah, could you do that on the equation?

833
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,800
You had back on the other page.

834
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,900
They're just so I make sure we got it.

835
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,800
How do I operate this program?

836
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
That's a very good option.

837
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
Okay, so what are we doing?

838
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,500
What do you want to know?

839
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,500
I just want to see.

840
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,400
So you said, like normalize it to the thing but I wasn't sure.

841
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I just wanted to know, like what is that?

842
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
Khloe is going on math wise here.

843
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
So I could own understanding of that.

844
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,400
So we draw our Square here.

845
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,900
Right.

846
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,300
Yeah.

847
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,500
And we're going to and then we're going to use in the pixel Shader.

848
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,100
We going to evaluate the distance from wherever point we are, right?

849
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,800
So into the pixel Shader, we pass our PC which is going to be this

850
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,400
point here which is our position center, okay?

851
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,700
And then and then

852
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,600
We are going to know our pixel position at each of these right?

853
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Because this is just going to be are transformed position out of the

854
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,100
vertex Shader and then so we know will say that for sake of argument

855
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,300
that this is 1010, okay.

856
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,200
And we're going to say the first pixel here, we know that that's going

857
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,100
to be let's just say well let's switch this to 100 100.

858
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,200
So we're going to say that this is going to be 50 on X and we'll say

859
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,700
150 on why this is going to be 150.

860
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,900
Jesus is not.

861
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,900
150, 150.

862
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,100
This is going to be 150, 50.

863
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,000
And this is going to be 5050 to do that, right?

864
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,600
So at each one of these pixels, right.

865
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,900
So we know that this is a hundred across a hundred across, right?

866
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,700
So, we take any point at every single Pixel in the pixel Shader that

867
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,200
we draw.

868
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
We can take say this point here of 150.

869
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
150.

870
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,200
We subtract it from the center point, which we pass is like, a uniform

871
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,000
or something.

872
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,400
Yeah, it wouldn't be preferred text Data would be pretty.

873
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,900
Actually would be per vertex data because we will match our draw

874
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,100
calls.

875
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:33,800
But so we have in the in the vertex Shader, we have the center point.

876
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,200
So we take 50 50 - 100

877
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,900
100 and we get a vector, that's 50.

878
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,500
50.

879
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:42,700
Okay.

880
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,500
So which of those two points there, you've got one 50/50.

881
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,000
This is PC and this is p Just P PC being the center point of me being

882
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:51,500
p.

883
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And then, so you subtract these two points and you get 50 50, okay?

884
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,800
And then the length of that is just the Pythagorean theorem, right?

885
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,900
50 well 50 squared plus 50 squared square root, right?

886
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,800
Okay which is twenty, five hundred twenty-five thousand square root of

887
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,400
five thousand some big number.

888
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay?

889
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So why did you subtract P from PC instead of the other way around?

890
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,800
Doesn't matter.

891
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:19,300
Okay.

892
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:19,900
Why doesn't it?

893
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,700
Why doesn't it matter is?

894
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,000
Once you once you square it, the negatives go away anyways and because

895
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,300
it's just a distance it's just an absolute value right?

896
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,900
So if you were to, if you were to take this point and this point

897
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,300
Point.

898
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,900
You're going to get the exact same distance regardless, right signs,

899
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,600
don't matter at that point because the square removes, the sign got

900
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,200
it, okay.

901
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,100
So now you were saying before the sort of started on this, you were

902
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,500
saying that you didn't need to do the square root.

903
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,000
So, I've got the square root here.

904
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,700
So okay.

905
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:46,900
Okay.

906
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,000
So tell me that part.

907
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,100
You do need a number, the square root.

908
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,400
Yeah.

909
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,100
Because so, the reason is,

910
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,400
So how the anti-aliasing works?

911
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,100
It's important for how the anti-alias.

912
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,200
Okay, so sorry, I interrupted you before I guess, tell me, tell me

913
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,900
that part then, yeah, so sometimes you need the square root, sometimes

914
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,200
you don't.

915
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,000
It depends on how much you're anti-aliasing, okay?

916
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,500
And how wide across your anti-aliasing.

917
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,300
Okay, so what we do normally is, by the way, this isn't the equations

918
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,500
that we used and I'm not going to remember what the equations that we

919
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,800
used our because I didn't derive them Krister Erickson did, they're

920
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
all in real-time Collision detection, right?

921
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:23,700
Okay.

922
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,500
Very simple primitive distance to Circle Arc distance triangle.

923
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,900
I could do it but I'll be here for hours.

924
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,200
Okay, yeah, yeah.

925
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,800
I understand, I just want to get a cursory understanding, right?

926
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,600
So this is, this is the to a point, right?

927
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,600
But you're actually doing to, you know, two points in the closest 22

928
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,200
points or closest to a circle Arc, which is are much more complicated.

929
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay, by much more.

930
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,200
I mean, they're like eight lines of code but like I can't remember

931
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:48,300
them.

932
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,800
Exactly.

933
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
Okay, so basically, so what you would do is a very simple thing, would

934
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,900
be like, if this point if this here, right?

935
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,700
So we're going to call this going to try to draw

936
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,400
We're going to call this D, right?

937
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,600
So you compute D, which is distance, right?

938
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,100
And you do that at every point in the pixel Shader and you say, if D

939
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,900
is greater than the radius, then this pixels Alpha value is 0.

940
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,200
If D is less than the radius, then this pixel off of value is 1,

941
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:14,900
right?

942
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,300
That's going to get you.

943
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,100
You don't actually do the if you do step, which is an opengl function,

944
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,300
that just steps between a range.

945
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,700
And if it's higher than this it gives you a number of is lower in this

946
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,700
against your number, right?

947
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,100
Okay.

948
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,500
So it's like a threshold in operator.

949
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,900
Yes, it's exactly what it is and that will give you no anti-aliasing

950
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,500
and a very hard Edge, right.

951
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,100
And if you do that, you can just Square the distance that you want to

952
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,900
be and then save yourself the square root.

953
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,500
Now, why is that the case?

954
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,400
Algebra.

955
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,200
What do you mean?

956
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,500
Why is it?

957
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,000
Well, well because I've got this value, and if I square rooted, I'm

958
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,700
going to have one thing.

959
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,700
And if I don't square rooted, I'm gonna have another thing.

960
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
So why can I feed this?

961
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
So let's so let's say you're let's say you want your evaluation

962
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,300
Radius to be 10.

963
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,400
Okay, so you do your square root here and you get the square root of.

964
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,500
Yeah, this is this is square root of five thousand, right?

965
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,000
So that's going to be 77 or something.

966
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:17,100
So you take, you can take the square root of 56 square, root of 5, or

967
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,300
a 5000, and then check it versus 10.

968
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,000
Or you can take 5000 and check in verses 10 squared, right?

969
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,800
It's just algebra like are less than or equal to

970
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:41,600
The square root of will call it T minus V where a math p- be, right?

971
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,200
So you could do that or you could do this in this implies that.

972
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,100
There's a square root in here right because it's that's this formula

973
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,500
here.

974
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,700
So because this implies a square root, you can just take, you can skip

975
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:59,800
the square root and you can get PX, minus py or PX minus p.

976
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:12,000
CX squared plus p, y- p, Cy squared and then you normally have a

977
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
square root, right?

978
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,700
But you can take the square root off of here and then just Square the

979
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,900
other side of the equation.

980
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,700
And then you get, it's the square root which okay used to really

981
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,000
matter.

982
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,300
But now it still matters, but it's not like the end of the world.

983
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:29,800
But anyway, so you could save the square root if you don't need any

984
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,400
and if you don't need a linear gradient in the in the in the vector

985
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,000
field got it.

986
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,900
But now you're saying, okay, so for the anti-aliasing part which are

987
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,400
about to explain you're saying maybe you do still need the square

988
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:40,900
root.

989
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
It depends on how much you're anti-aliasing by, right?

990
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,100
Because like I said originally, when you generate the triangle strip

991
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,000
around the line that you want to draw your either, using your passing

992
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,300
two, extra parameters, the thickness of the line and some sort of fall

993
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,600
off, which is how blurry the line gets right, and that's what your

994
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,000
anti-aliasing, it's right.

995
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,500
Okay.

996
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,600
So if you pass one pixel as how thick you want the line, probably

997
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,000
can't tell.

998
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,300
But if you want the line to be, if you're on a 4K display, we're

999
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,700
anti-aliasing is really, really tight.

1000
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,800
You're going to want to pixels of anti-aliasing because it looks a

1001
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,400
little bit better.

1002
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,200
Especially so our test for this was we took a black background which

1003
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,400
is a white one pixel line and spun.

1004
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,600
It very very, very slowly and and look at that and we're like, okay

1005
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,200
where's the highest amount of artifact and then and then tweaked our

1006
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,300
through.

1007
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Hold value for how much we wanted to blur it out based on the worst

1008
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
case scenario in that situation.

1009
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,300
And that's what we got the anti-aliasing.

1010
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,500
Now.

1011
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,400
Can you show a little bit of an understanding here because I'm not

1012
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:39,600
sure.

1013
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,200
I totally understand.

1014
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,400
When you say how much anti-aliasing, you want, what, how, what do you

1015
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,200
really mean?

1016
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
Like, can you draw that good?

1017
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Maybe, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Go back to that.

1019
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,700
Try to get to that.

1020
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,200
Okay, sorry.

1021
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
So so yeah.

1022
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:51,900
Okay.

1023
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,400
So

1024
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,000
If you look at and I'm going to delete all this, you don't need this

1025
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,400
anymore.

1026
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,100
No, I've got it.

1027
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,200
That made perfect sense.

1028
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,500
Thank you.

1029
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,800
Okay.

1030
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,700
So when you draw a straight line, I'm going to do this in Photoshop

1031
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,500
because I'm more familiar with that program and I think it does.

1032
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,000
Okay, so when you draw a straight line in Photoshop, right?

1033
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,700
Put on different layer for a second.

1034
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,600
Do you draw a straight line in Photoshop?

1035
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,100
There's absolutely no anti-aliasing on it, right?

1036
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,900
If use the pencil tool.

1037
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,200
So this is exactly perfect one pixel line, right?

1038
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:28,600
Okay.

1039
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,300
If you take this line, you rotate it.

1040
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I some number.

1041
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,500
That's not nice.

1042
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,300
Yeah,

1043
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,000
You can get screwed, right?

1044
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,500
Okay.

1045
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,100
However, if you take the exact same line, right?

1046
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,300
And then you do well, you just, you know, you can maybe the best way

1047
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:49,800
of doing this.

1048
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,100
The best way of doing this is

1049
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,500
here.

1050
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,200
And then we can wear it.

1051
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,300
So if you blur the line you sort of get anti aliasing effect and then

1052
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,900
you adjust the levels of we little bit here.

1053
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,800
So, now what you have is you have exactly what we would have

1054
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,600
implemented.

1055
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,200
This is an exact to pixel fall off.

1056
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,000
So the, the amount of anti-aliasing for this line is exactly two

1057
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,800
pixels, right?

1058
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,300
Also, if you look in close, you got your one solid pixel in the

1059
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,700
middle.

1060
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,100
And then you got some, some amount of this is all Alpha.

1061
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,500
By the way, there's no color in this.

1062
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,300
So you got some amount that your Alpha value, step down, one pixel

1063
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,700
away, and some about the alphabet you step down to pixels away, right?

1064
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,200
So now, when you take this,

1065
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:42,700
This line and you put it back here and you rotate it and weird number.

1066
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,800
It looks way better, right?

1067
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,400
And that's because you got this amount of anti-aliasing happening,

1068
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:49,700
right?

1069
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:49,900
Okay.

1070
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:53,500
And if you were to take, sorry, so correct me if I'm wrong here but

1071
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,400
just from just trying to understand that part.

1072
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,300
So in some sense you're not really talking about anti-aliasing your

1073
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,800
more just talking about radial fall off because an anti aliased line

1074
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:12,400
would only have one at most one pixel of non one alpha.

1075
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah.

1076
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,600
If you're talking about what that matrix, definition of like you're

1077
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,700
doing triangle like FXAA or you doing Maltese amply anti-aliasing like

1078
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,300
a moderate coverage base.

1079
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,600
If that?

1080
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,900
Yeah, if you don't come over, just like that.

1081
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,400
Sort of an it.

1082
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,000
No, it's not.

1083
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,500
That this is a very different type of anti-aliasing.

1084
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,200
Interesting.

1085
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,400
Okay.

1086
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,500
So tell me a little bit about that.

1087
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,000
So, how did you decide or why was that the approach that was taken on

1088
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:35,200
this?

1089
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,200
As opposed to maybe the more traditional concept of anti-aliasing,

1090
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,300
which is just to figure out how thing is touch the screen pixels,

1091
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,100
right?

1092
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,600
So the idea was

1093
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,200
Does when you start moving these lines.

1094
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,500
And if you take a line and you stretch it out, or you take a line and

1095
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,300
then you bend it, you get it looks better in.

1096
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,200
And when you start moving these lines, we did tests, it actually looks

1097
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,900
better, this looks better for high.

1098
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,100
Trust lineart.

1099
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,600
Then simply then simply doing FXAA or something like that.

1100
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,200
I mean, if we were to do like 16 by 16 multi sample, or something like

1101
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
that, where we maybe then it would look good.

1102
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,800
But that's just prohibitively expensive.

1103
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,200
So I think 4x4 is what the PS4 supports natively.

1104
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,400
I don't remember.

1105
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,900
Whatever it is, like, I think it's for.

1106
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,000
I think you can take 16 samples per pixel on a PS4.

1107
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:24,600
Okay.

1108
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,200
It doesn't look as good.

1109
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,500
All right, so I guess I get it now.

1110
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,800
So, back to the original thing, so that was what we were.

1111
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,700
Trying to implement was this fall off?

1112
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,600
Yes.

1113
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,000
Okay.

1114
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,700
And we did it through the side distance field thing.

1115
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,400
Okay, so now go back to the thing before and just give me the the

1116
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,300
square root versus non square root thing.

1117
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,900
So, okay, so when you do the square root, that's fine for when you

1118
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,300
don't want it.

1119
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,500
When you just want a hard step it, I think, I think maybe there's too

1120
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,400
much emphasis placed in the square root thing because I never

1121
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,200
actually, I was just like, oh, we could say the square root but never

1122
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,200
actually did because who cares, okay, but you know, it's worth talking

1123
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,700
about, I guess.

1124
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,300
So when when you do this, you have some sort of you have well do I

1125
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,000
still have that image here?

1126
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,800
Nope, that's something completely different.

1127
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,100
Let's not look at that.

1128
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,400
When you actually just look at the values of the signed distance

1129
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,000
field, right?

1130
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,800
You get like, I drew before

1131
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,100
You get this right and see if to take well you get this.

1132
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,100
So this is like this is the 120, right?

1133
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,100
Vector.

1134
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,100
It's just a simple Vector gradient, right?

1135
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:32,300
Yeah.

1136
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:38,200
So what you have to do is say, you want your circle to be, you know,

1137
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,400
maybe this big, right?

1138
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,700
Yeah.

1139
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:45,200
So, if you want your circle to be this big, then you have to figure

1140
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,500
out how to map from this gradient to this, right?

1141
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,800
Oh, there's ways, you know, like I said, the first example that I gave

1142
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,300
you was the step example, right?

1143
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,400
Another example is there's smooth step, which is actually what we

1144
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,500
used, which is a cubic hermite spline.

1145
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,500
Do I need to go into that?

1146
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,900
Yeah, cubic hermite spline.

1147
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:11,700
Okay.

1148
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,100
I don't know the actual definition of her might slide, but cubic

1149
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,700
function is, you know, a mathematical function.

1150
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,100
You know, Y is equal to

1151
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:26,200
I guess we don't use Y in math, we go, you know, FX is what is it a

1152
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,200
I'll use T because T is sort of the traditional F at T is equal to you

1153
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:40,000
know, 80 Cube because it's cubic be t squared c t+ d, right?

1154
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,600
So any any function that has this property has to guess the called

1155
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,700
inflection points has to inflection points in it, where

1156
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,600
So the curve might look like let me see if I can get the as we want

1157
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,700
the curve to be like that.

1158
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,100
So

1159
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,700
You know, we'll have a curve.

1160
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
This is cubic Point cubic function, right?

1161
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,400
So you have an inflection point here and an inflection point here,

1162
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:03,900
right?

1163
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,300
And this is going to be monotonically.

1164
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,900
Decreasing here monotonically decreasing here are monotonically

1165
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,900
increasing here, right?

1166
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,200
Okay.

1167
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:09,900
It could be flipped.

1168
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,700
It could be flipped, right?

1169
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,800
Because I have three monitors up monotonic sections, right?

1170
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,200
Okay.

1171
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,000
With two inflection points, right?

1172
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,600
So I believe that if a nation of a cubic hermite spline is f at T.

1173
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,600
I don't know if this is the correct technical definition but this is

1174
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:24,800
good enough.

1175
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,500
So you're going to have F at T or sorry, not if it to you going to

1176
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,800
have F at 0.

1177
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
Crow is going to be equal to 0.

1178
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
F at 1 is going to be equal to 1.

1179
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,000
F.

1180
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,900
The first derivative of F at 0 is going to be 0.

1181
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,600
And the first derivative of F at 1 is also going to be 0, right?

1182
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,500
So that just means that, you know, it's completely flat here.

1183
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,600
It's completely flat here, right?

1184
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay.

1185
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,800
Which is going to be at all inflection points, right?

1186
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,000
But the point is that it goes from 0 to 1, right?

1187
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,800
So at this point here, so this is f of t on the

1188
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,000
You know, this axis here, this is 0 and then you come across here on

1189
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,700
this axis here, this is 1, right?

1190
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:05,900
Okay.

1191
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:12,300
And then if you solve for all this soon as you go f at 0 so you said

1192
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,800
all these 20 so that knocks at zero that knocks out the D parameter

1193
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:20,200
because D has to be 0 and then when you do F Prime at 0, right?

1194
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,500
So your F Prime function is going to be what is it?

1195
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,900
380 squared plus 2 BT.

1196
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500
Plus C.

1197
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,400
So if F Prime at 0 is also 0 that means that this is 0 and this is 0.

1198
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:41,800
So C is also equal to zero and then you can do like a, you just set it

1199
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,200
up as a linear systems of equations, do you know, gauss-jordan,

1200
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:51,600
elimination solve it, and then I think you get minus 2T cubed plus 3T

1201
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,500
squared, so that's your function.

1202
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,800
Is this cubic hermite spline has essentially, no parameters.

1203
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,100
It's, it's hard coded to be just this one little

1204
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:00,900
Lump.

1205
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,200
Yes, it's this.

1206
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,100
This is the function.

1207
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,200
Okay, this is not it.

1208
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,200
So, it takes all of this and that's how it takes this normal camera

1209
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,200
function applies, these parameters, what f is 0 what?

1210
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,200
F Prime of 0 has to be, you fill it all in.

1211
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,000
You get yourself systems of equations of what these two things have to

1212
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,900
be 0 because you at this point, you only have two unknowns.

1213
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,400
So it's got to be solvable and you get this function, I think.

1214
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,000
Okay, pretty sure that's what it is.

1215
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:28,300
All right?

1216
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,100
That's what's that's what smooth step.

1217
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,800
It does, right?

1218
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,000
Okay?

1219
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,200
So what you do is you take, that's not what we wanted, where is

1220
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,900
Photoshop.

1221
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,600
So basically what it does is it takes this gradient that we have here,

1222
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,500
which is going to be a linear gradient, which is so, if you look at

1223
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,900
the fall off, it's going to be like that.

1224
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,900
And it takes it.

1225
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,500
And if you put all of the parameters in it Maps it to be.

1226
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,200
Let's use blue, it Maps it to look.

1227
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,600
Something like that, right?

1228
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,800
And that's going to be this part of the high C, cute.

1229
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:06,700
So this here is where we do is how we determine the coverage of each

1230
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,200
pixel.

1231
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,800
So instead of just doing a linear fall-off where we, you know, we do a

1232
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,500
fall off and we say if it's greater than this, if if it's greater than

1233
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:21,000
this one, if it's less than this 0 by a smooth step to it, and you

1234
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,300
sort of clamp the range and you get some sort of a gradient fall off,

1235
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,600
where it's probably equivalent to, I don't know.

1236
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,000
Let's see if we were to

1237
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,200
Use Photoshop to all of its Glory.

1238
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,300
You get something that's not really exaggerated.

1239
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,000
Yeah, this is a really exaggerated fall off, but you get this right

1240
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,600
that effect that you get, got it.

1241
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,100
Okay, so I have one more question just because we're it's almost time

1242
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,800
for me to let you go to the next interview here.

1243
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,300
So one more question I had is just going back to something.

1244
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,100
You said earlier, you were like, oh, the the functions we use for the

1245
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,700
distance field, we use.

1246
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,800
Christopher eriksson's, derivations for something and and I didn't

1247
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,800
quite have a chance at that.

1248
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,900
Don't ask you, sorry.

1249
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,500
What is this something again?

1250
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,200
What are the actual Primitives that you were talking about that?

1251
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,500
I think you said two points or an arc or what were those what was that

1252
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,500
second line segment?

1253
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,900
Which is just two points and a circle Arc?

1254
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,500
Which is a guest who to radians?

1255
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,600
Like how far around each point of the circle?

1256
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,000
It is.

1257
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But before, wasn't it?

1258
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,500
Tell me the line segment once it's to show me that they're that again.

1259
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,400
I know that you were saying that you didn't derive these two.

1260
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,900
I'm not trying to ask that and I just meant like tell me a little bit

1261
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,600
about that process.

1262
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,700
So I get I kind of get that.

1263
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,400
Part.

1264
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:30,800
Okay.

1265
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,200
So we'd have a pixel shit.

1266
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,900
We'd have a Shader.

1267
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,000
Actually there's another interesting part of this that I hope we have

1268
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,300
time to get to which is double coverage pixels, which was the real,

1269
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,100
which is the actual problem with this algorithm.

1270
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,900
That was the, that was the hard part.

1271
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,700
You may not have time to get to it, but we could.

1272
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,200
But let's just to tell me this part first and then we can.

1273
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:51,300
Okay, so basically you pass to a pixel Shader, you would pass two

1274
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,600
points, P0 will call them P0 P1.

1275
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,700
And then, instead of doing the point to like,

1276
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,500
In the previous example, right?

1277
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:07,100
We had a PC and we had all of the points in the Square.

1278
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,000
So we would generate the same square here and instead of doing

1279
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,600
distance to point, we did distance two line segments and then the line

1280
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,400
segments are defined by these two points.

1281
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,600
And in order to draw the couple hundred thousand things that we did

1282
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,700
per frame, that we're all computed on the CPU, all of this stuff was

1283
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,800
done in a single draw call.

1284
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:28,700
So

1285
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,100
we bash it up in a draw call.

1286
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,400
So each vertex actually had a lot of redundant data, okay?

1287
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:39,600
Because each vertex sent the P0 in the P1 because you couldn't do like

1288
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,500
now you can inject like variables and then do weird draw call stuff

1289
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:48,400
with modern opengl but you couldn't do that in on the PS4.

1290
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,600
So basically it was a lot of redundant data built into the into the

1291
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,800
vertebrae into the vertices.

1292
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,800
So taking so you have to find because I understood the part about

1293
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,700
finding the distance to a

1294
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,400
That we were talking about before.

1295
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,000
So if I want to talk about the distance, this line segment I suppose,

1296
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,400
so is that something I can do with a single equation?

1297
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,300
Or no.

1298
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,400
So how does that work?

1299
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,300
Kind of, I mean, to the extent that you can tell me, how does it work?

1300
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,800
My guess is.

1301
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,400
And I haven't looked at it, but my guess is, let's say we have this

1302
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,300
point, okay?

1303
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,200
We can get the distance between these two.

1304
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:29,500
I don't know.

1305
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,700
We could draw a triangle.

1306
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,600
We can get the area of the the signed area of the triangle.

1307
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,200
Because okay, so this is PC or PQ, I guess query Point.

1308
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,000
Okay, so if you make two vectors V 0 PQ, this, I'm just making this

1309
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,200
up, I hope it's correct P0.

1310
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,900
Yeah, I mean, I'm just like when I said like, this is just, I

1311
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,800
understand the fact that you're saying that use other ones.

1312
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,900
So I'm not, I don't expect you to even know what I was just curious.

1313
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,200
I'm just interested to see.

1314
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,100
All right, so we can get these two vectors and if you take

1315
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:05,800
The you know V zero x v 0, V 0, y V1, X V1 y.

1316
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,500
You take the determinant of that which is that correct?

1317
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Yeah so it's V 0 x times V 1 y minus minus plus plus v, zero, y dot,

1318
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:27,000
V1 X, that gives you the area.

1319
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:31,300
One of the parallelogram half of that area, will give you the signed

1320
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:31,700
distance.

1321
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,000
So you take the determinant of that over 2 will give you the signed

1322
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,800
distance of that and a triangles find different of what.

1323
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:38,300
Sorry.

1324
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,700
Sorry it gives you this the signed area of the triangle.

1325
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,200
Okay, so gives you the energy of the triangle the area of the

1326
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,600
triangle, right?

1327
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,100
Because the determined determinant of this vector and this Vector

1328
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,900
divided, we back into the area of the parallelogram and then over to

1329
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,100
gives you the area of that.

1330
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,400
And then

1331
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,800
Yeah, formula for triangle is one half.

1332
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,500
BH right base times height.

1333
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,200
So if we treat this Vector here we can get the length of that pretty

1334
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:04,700
easily.

1335
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,200
We can't get the height.

1336
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,500
So height would be our distance, right?

1337
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:17,300
So we know what that area what base is so half of Base which we know

1338
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,500
height is equal to.

1339
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:26,000
Well, the determinant of V 0 V 1 over 2 we can multiply those out.

1340
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,700
And then take the height is equal to that determinant over over or

1341
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,700
sorry the base.

1342
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,900
But we know what the bait, the length of the base is.

1343
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,400
So if we take the height, is that over the base?

1344
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,700
And we get the height, which I guess is the distance to that, but that

1345
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,400
would only work if that is constrained within this region here.

1346
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,900
So maybe there has to be an F to be.

1347
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:53,100
Like, if that's if this, the query point is outside of that range and

1348
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:53,800
I owe you, okay?

1349
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,100
Yeah.

1350
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,000
So wait, I think that makes some sense.

1351
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,500
So maybe it.

1352
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Can you scroll down a little bit?

1353
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,600
Here are it's an ethical question.

1354
00:59:59,600 --> 00:59:59,800
How

1355
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,700
We do that.

1356
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:05,600
So let's say we had just that line segment and we wanted to go like

1357
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,800
okay is PQ in inside that region.

1358
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,000
Oh God let me do that.

1359
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,600
That's a Verona region or could be used barycentric, coordinates for

1360
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:16,800
that?

1361
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,100
I don't know.

1362
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,700
I'd have to look it up, I don't know, I don't know.

1363
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,800
Off the top of my head, I'm sure well, there is a Verona, I region

1364
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,200
formula for it because we can tell, if it's in which slab, it's going

1365
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,000
to be in.

1366
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,800
But off the top of my head, my eyes,

1367
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,600
Geometry knowledge would see me struggle greatly to solve this and

1368
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,000
this is something that I would just Google.

1369
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,800
Okay, well so that well I guess the way you do it there, right?

1370
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,400
You've got kind of line, you sort of, you sort of make pretty.

1371
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,100
Is that a is?

1372
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:45,600
What is that?

1373
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,400
That's perpendicular.

1374
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,300
I guess those lines that you drew their, to the the line.

1375
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,100
So, yeah.

1376
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,600
So we could

1377
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,500
because you could generate a triangle here and then

1378
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:05,700
If you.this with, you can figure out which one do you do another?

1379
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,100
Because, yeah, because you could do this generate, this triangle

1380
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,000
figure out the winding order with the determinant to figure out if

1381
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,000
it's inside of this side and then do it again on that side.

1382
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,700
But there's no way that's how it works because that's way too much way

1383
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,100
simpler.

1384
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,700
It was wave simpler than that.

1385
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,000
So you could like, you could, you could figure out this triangle

1386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,600
right?

1387
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,300
And then figure out the winding order to tell.

1388
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,000
If this point is here, this point is here and then you could do it

1389
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,300
with

1390
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:34,200
This triangle here and then do I have to do have to go over.

1391
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,300
What?

1392
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,100
No, no, I totally got actually got okay.

1393
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,500
So yeah, so you could do that, but that's not how it was done.

1394
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,800
It was way simpler than that and I don't remember how it was done.

1395
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,300
All right.

1396
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:45,100
Well I don't want to take up any more of your time here because we are

1397
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,400
we are out of interview.

1398
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,700
I got a you're going to need time to walk to the next office basically

1399
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:53,200
but thanks so much for explaining all that that was that was awesome.

1400
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,300
And yeah, it was great meeting you.

1401
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,200
All right.

1402
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Well thank you very much.

1403
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:57,800
Thank you.

1404
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,000
All right.

1405
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,800
That that concludes the interview process.

1406
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,600
How did it feel?

1407
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,900
Sean, does that with that reasonable or not?

1408
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:06,900
Yeah.

1409
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,400
I mean I don't know how my answers were.

1410
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,800
That's what I'm sort of curious about.

1411
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,100
Right?

1412
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,900
Because I'm, I don't know.

1413
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,300
Well, like it seemed fine but like, I don't know how like it seems

1414
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,700
like the questions were all reasonable and it was sort of like just

1415
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,200
explain this to me, but like I know that, you know, this stuff.

1416
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,600
So I'm like, ah, fuck why is he asked me to explain this, right?

1417
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,900
Well, that's the part that we can't get around for this.

1418
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:29,200
This.

1419
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,400
So I was going to mention that is like so normally you know just

1420
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,400
unpacking the the interview process, right?

1421
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,800
First of all that was perfect like that was exactly what I would have

1422
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,200
wanted and it tells me like everything I need to know about the the

1423
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:42,800
person, right?

1424
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:50,500
Because, you know, you can see how basically we essentially did all

1425
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,200
the sorts of stuff that you might expect to do in a programming

1426
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,900
problem style interview, but it was all stuff.

1427
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,800
You already had been familiar with

1428
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,700
so,

1429
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,100
You didn't have to like come in cold and you could in so much as was

1430
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,800
possible, given that you already know me.

1431
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,400
I'm at a bit of a disadvantage, but you get to be in the authoritative

1432
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,300
position, which is the really important part, right?

1433
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:18,800
You're telling me how this thing works, not me asking you a problem

1434
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,200
that I know the answer to and you don't, you know what I'm saying,

1435
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,100
right?

1436
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,700
And, you know, yeah.

1437
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,900
And so the problem is, you know, I know all the stuff I was playing

1438
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,900
dumb about which makes it harder because you're

1439
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,900
Credulous when I say stuff like why don't you need the square root?

1440
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,500
Normally an interviewer might just think I'm that dumb right?

1441
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:38,900
Like, they don't know.

1442
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:42,300
Yeah, that question actually threw me off because I was like, yeah.

1443
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,000
What do you?

1444
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,700
What do you mean?

1445
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,200
Of course, right.

1446
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,800
Living in Hawaii but you know, when they're just walking in here, I

1447
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,900
could just be some idiot.

1448
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,200
Right?

1449
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,900
And that's so, that's okay, you know, maybe it's not my area of

1450
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:52,600
expertise.

1451
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,500
So, right.

1452
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,200
So, you know that is a little, that was certainly going to be harder

1453
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,800
for you, because you knew, I knew it already, but that's how you have

1454
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,900
to do those kinds of

1455
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,400
Because I need to see how comfortable you are with this stuff and it's

1456
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,100
obvious, right?

1457
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,700
Mean you are able to explain it all and be very clear about it and

1458
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,600
whatever is so that's exactly what you want to see but you can

1459
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,500
understand how a lot of people.

1460
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,700
Maybe they looked up some stuff that Krista Erickson wrote and just

1461
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,900
typed it in and have no capability of explaining to me like what

1462
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,000
smooth step is or why you would use it or any of that stuff, right?

1463
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
And so what you're trying to do is like pull that stuff out and see to

1464
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,800
what extent does this person really understand what they've done.

1465
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,900
Done, right?

1466
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,300
And it becomes very clear very quickly, right?

1467
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,500
Either it ends up looking basically, like what you did, where you get

1468
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:37,400
pretty excited about it.

1469
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,500
And you're showing me some diagrams and you're like, see this works

1470
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,200
like this and this is how this works and like, oh, okay, here you

1471
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,000
didn't understand that.

1472
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,700
Let me show you this other way of looking at it.

1473
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,000
It quickly either goes that direction or I'm not sure like whatever I

1474
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
really don't know, right.

1475
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,700
You know what I'm saying?

1476
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:52,500
Yeah.

1477
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,000
And what I find interesting is I thought you were like I didn't know

1478
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,200
much about what this process was beforehand so I thought you were

1479
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,800
like, dude.

1480
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,900
It is, I thought you were going to be like, no, right?

1481
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,400
That linear.

1482
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,600
Write the two equations that are needed and do and solve the linear

1483
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,800
system of equations to get.

1484
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,400
The termites, is that the hermite spline function?

1485
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,100
Is that what that means?

1486
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:14,300
I don't even know Matt terms, I don't know.

1487
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
I have no idea.

1488
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,700
I always read arrived on my curves every time so I have no idea what

1489
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,000
the names for the various because you know all cubic curves are cubic

1490
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,300
curve.

1491
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:23,500
Right.

1492
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,500
They already think.

1493
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:27,400
So everyone just wanted their name attached to some so it's you know

1494
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,600
or is it did busy I get his name on this one.

1495
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:29,800
I do

1496
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,200
No.

1497
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,100
So I have no idea which one it is.

1498
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:32,400
Yeah.

1499
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,200
And I don't care.

1500
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,700
All again in the interview, the only thing I cared about was that you

1501
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,800
could show me that right?

1502
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,700
Because then it's clear.

1503
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,000
It's like yes, I don't, I don't even care if you solve it correctly on

1504
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,600
the Whiteboard because I'm horrible at that kind of math.

1505
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,200
I would probably make a mistake.

1506
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,500
So I'm not even looking what I'm looking for.

1507
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,000
Is your confidence in the process and what the thing is mean, and so

1508
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,500
as long as I've got that, I just assumed that if given three hours to

1509
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,700
solve for a her mites,

1510
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,500
You would be able to because, you know, it's unlikely that you

1511
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,600
couldn't open Mathematica if you needed to or something, right?

1512
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,600
If you were that bad at solving or something and get the correct

1513
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,300
answer or like you said, Google it, right?

1514
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,000
So I just want to see that your brain is capable of putting all these

1515
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,400
things together, understands the picture and knows what's going on

1516
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,600
your ability to solve.

1517
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,100
The math is not so interesting because again that's not something that

1518
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:26,000
you do in programming that often with no assistance and especially not

1519
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
in a limited amount of time, right, right.

1520
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,300
Yeah.

1521
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:29,800
And that's the other thing.

1522
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,400
Is like, for almost all of, for almost all of the answers that I've

1523
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,100
seen in, like this is what the Whiteboard questions are, right?

1524
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,000
It's just like I would just use Google like yeah, right?

1525
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,100
What data structure should I use in this situation?

1526
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,000
I don't know.

1527
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,900
At some sort of a tree all, I'll just Google it right?

1528
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:50,000
Like the answer is almost always.

1529
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,900
Why would I even have this information in my head?

1530
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,300
Well, that's why again, I like this style of interview it's because

1531
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,800
you have some process that you've gone through to do.

1532
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,100
Ramming, right?

1533
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,100
And you know, a lot research is an important part of programming, you

1534
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:08,700
know, you don't typically want someone who's going to re-derive

1535
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,600
everything from scratch every time without looking to see what other

1536
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,600
people have already done.

1537
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:12,900
Right.

1538
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:16,200
That's, that's not right, a particularly great approach to programming

1539
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,500
because there's a lot of smart people out there and they've looked at

1540
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,200
this problem and you want to know what they thought.

1541
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,700
So, one of the big reasons that I like this style is you've done that

1542
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,500
process, whatever your process is for this problem.

1543
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,400
Right?

1544
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:36,400
And now I'm asking you to explain back to me what you figured out and

1545
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,800
if Googling someone else's work on, it was part of the process that

1546
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,600
doesn't matter to me.

1547
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:45,600
What matters to me, is that you understood afterwards, what happened?

1548
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,800
And how that fit into what you were doing, why?

1549
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,600
It was the right decision or whatever, like all those sorts of things

1550
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,500
and I can tell that when you're talking about something you've already

1551
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:59,700
done when I'm giving you a problem, cold you never

1552
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,600
Chance to go through your standard process.

1553
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,100
So, who cares what you do at that point, you're not doing what you

1554
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,800
would normally do, right?

1555
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:07,600
Right.

1556
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,700
So by the way, if you can see it, that's the actual form.

1557
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,200
I actually already know how to do off the top of your head.

1558
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:14,700
Yeah.

1559
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,300
How do you know how to do it off the top of your head?

1560
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,300
Well, so looking at it, right?

1561
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,800
I mean, this is, the thing is, I spent all that time doing gjk and

1562
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
that's the second case in gjk.

1563
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,500
Okay, right.

1564
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:26,600
Yeah.

1565
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,300
Because I have like, no, I haven't actually implemented.

1566
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:29,800
So that

1567
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:34,899
the dot product of the vector of the P0 P1 Vector is pointing in the

1568
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:35,500
direction.

1569
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:39,500
You need to dot product against to test, which region you're in of the

1570
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,300
three regions, okay?

1571
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,100
You know, because it is the it is the Verona region.

1572
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,899
So once you get that dot product, you know what region you're in, if

1573
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:49,500
you're in either of the two end cap regions, you just need the

1574
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,300
distance to the point, right?

1575
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,000
Which we already have, it's just a fallback.

1576
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,300
If you're inside the region, then it's just a perpendicular.

1577
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,800
Which hey, is the cross product.

1578
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,800
The length of the cross product is

1579
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
To be the distance from the line segment out.

1580
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,000
That's all you need 3D though.

1581
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,600
Interval.

1582
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:08,000
It's an all-day so you just do a perpendicular dot product.

1583
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,399
YES, Prep.

1584
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,100
.O K.

1585
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,500
Perp out.

1586
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,200
Okay, okay.

1587
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,399
All right.

1588
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,600
Well shit, they all D.

1589
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,800
It's not in Aldie you need.

1590
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,399
The, what is it?

1591
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,100
The wedge product.

1592
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,100
You need the the 4D correct.

1593
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,100
One to go out.

1594
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:25,300
But yeah, I knew how to do it but this is this again like so.

1595
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,399
So looking at that process, right?

1596
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,899
And kind of going back to it.

1597
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:29,800
I'm packing it now for

1598
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,100
People who are watching and again, like I said, this is this entire

1599
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,899
stream, is it designed to instruct the interviewer, not the

1600
01:09:36,899 --> 01:09:37,800
interviewee, right?

1601
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:41,500
The stream has nothing to do with then, like, I'm looking at the code

1602
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,000
now with my answers dumb, this is not a good way, to determine to

1603
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,300
determine the distance, right?

1604
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:48,600
Right.

1605
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,800
Well, so again, so it's okay.

1606
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,000
So let's, let's unpack the whole interview if you want to talk about

1607
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,899
the whole interview, right?

1608
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,300
So you can see how I structured interview, right?

1609
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,700
The first part of it was just talking to you to establish some kind of

1610
01:09:59,700 --> 01:09:59,900
relationship.

1611
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,900
Or so that the person doesn't feel like they're being slapped with

1612
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,700
tech right off the bat, right?

1613
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,000
So, just trying to talk, you know, it was.

1614
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,400
I thought that was really interesting to it.

1615
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,700
Also, it was interesting personal perspective to that.

1616
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,000
Just happened to come out.

1617
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,700
I wasn't necessarily going for that, but it was neat.

1618
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,100
I learned about, you know, you said you enjoyed competitive things

1619
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,900
that you liked Esports and here's why.

1620
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,400
And you didn't really love playing games as much anymore, which is so

1621
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:22,800
I got to learn something about you, which is great to write.

1622
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,600
If, you know, if, if the person is forthcoming about certain aspects

1623
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,100
of that, that's a really nice thing to know, too.

1624
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,800
Because now you just have a better connection with

1625
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,700
That person you're going to have an easier time, interviewing them

1626
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,200
certainly.

1627
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,600
And you know, something about them that maybe is relevant to their

1628
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:35,800
job.

1629
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,700
Maybe not, who knows?

1630
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,000
Right?

1631
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,600
That's a hard thing to say, but so that part is kind of irrelevant to

1632
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,100
the tech side.

1633
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,200
It's just a time to get things warmed up and then from there you can

1634
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:49,100
kind of see I went through about a 10-minute process and this part is

1635
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,700
very important to get, right?

1636
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:56,100
I'm a little rusty at it but hopefully I did, okay, which is trying to

1637
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,700
get you into position to start talking with me about tech specifics.

1638
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,900
So you saw me kind of get you down towards a specific, technical area

1639
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:09,400
that I could kind of just start asking questions about and it did not

1640
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,000
matter to me.

1641
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,800
Where that was right.

1642
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,600
I just needed you to be somewhere.

1643
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,200
You felt interested in explaining something to me.

1644
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,800
And so you saw me kind of I poked around that with the assets

1645
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,600
dreaming, a little, it didn't seem like there was really maybe that

1646
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,800
much there to really explain.

1647
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,100
So I kind of I pushed around a little bit more, the diet then came up

1648
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:27,900
and you start to talk about the NSA seemed like you were interested in

1649
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,000
it.

1650
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,800
So I was like, okay, this we can get

1651
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,700
The I can get all the tech stuff I need out of this.

1652
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,200
So let's just go there, right?

1653
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,800
So then I asked you a bunch of stuff to explain to me throughout the

1654
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,700
course of that.

1655
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,900
And basically like I noticed that, you know, most things you felt very

1656
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:43,000
comfortable, explaining the distance one.

1657
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,200
You didn't that the two-point distance one.

1658
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,400
You didn't want to explain, right?

1659
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,100
You got it all because you didn't drive it, right?

1660
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,600
So what I did is I push that one to the end because I wanted to spend

1661
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,200
most of the time on stuff you were comfortable with because that's the

1662
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,200
most important stuff.

1663
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,800
And then at the end, I was just like

1664
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,400
I'm pretty confident.

1665
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,700
This person knows what they're doing, right?

1666
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,600
I liked everything I heard right.

1667
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:06,800
You know.

1668
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,800
Like I was like he explained it very eloquently.

1669
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,600
He drew diagrams that I understood he was patient with me, right?

1670
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,400
You didn't get annoyed that I was asking these questions which again

1671
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,600
in this circumstances even doubly good because you know, I know the

1672
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,600
answer to a lot of these things.

1673
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,200
So you getting impatient with me is even more on the table, right?

1674
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,000
But you didn't you took the time to explain it which is great.

1675
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,800
And so at the end, what I wanted

1676
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,700
To do was just go.

1677
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:34,300
Okay, let me since I'm very confident that I've gotten, you know, good

1678
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,100
answers on a test.

1679
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,600
Let me just see what happens if I just throw something at him that I

1680
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,600
know he's uncomfortable with just to see where he goes.

1681
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,000
And so that was all.

1682
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,500
That was just was to see that.

1683
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,300
If I had had more time at the end, I may have pushed you down to

1684
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:52,600
actually trying to solve it but you know, I wasn't super interested in

1685
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:52,800
that.

1686
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,200
So I didn't prioritize that in terms of time.

1687
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,500
Well that's a question, I would actually work.

1688
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,400
It's just terrible.

1689
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,900
Actually, but that's okay.

1690
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:04,500
Because a lot of times, the first solution is terrible, right?

1691
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,700
A lot of times, my first solution to any programming.

1692
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,900
Problem is terrible and I expect yours is too.

1693
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,200
All I wanted to see was how you were thinking about the problem.

1694
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,000
What do your attack skills look like Etc?

1695
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,500
Right?

1696
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,500
And so that was it.

1697
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:19,800
So if we'd had more time and it, or if I really wasn't sure because

1698
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,300
based on all the answers you were giving me.

1699
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,400
It seemed like you were capable of working through these things.

1700
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,100
So I wasn't super concerned about that.

1701
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,500
Maybe if I had been more concerned about that, we spent more time at

1702
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,800
but I just at the end I was like let's just

1703
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,400
To see what it looks like when he attacks the problem.

1704
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,700
You know, that, that was all that was

1705
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:36,700
It was good.

1706
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:41,100
I thought you were going to go deeper like I thought I thought the

1707
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,900
whole point of the interview originally before I knew what it was

1708
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,100
would have been like no you have to solve this, right?

1709
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,400
And I would have thought that for the hermite spline know you have to

1710
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,600
because I just I knew it was minus 2T cubed plus 3T squared, right?

1711
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:56,900
I just I remember that, right?

1712
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,100
I thought you going to be like, no, dude, the take take your four

1713
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,900
formulas, cut them all out, figure it out but I guess I mean, you

1714
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,000
know, from my perspective

1715
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,500
If I do that's you could cut and paste what you just told me into

1716
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,000
Mathematica, it would produce the answer.

1717
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,300
What I wanted to hear.

1718
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:16,900
There was okay, here, I understand the concept of a cubic equation.

1719
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,500
I understand the concept that if I constrain enough points of it, then

1720
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,000
it will solve down to a fixed answer.

1721
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,900
That's the important part.

1722
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:31,100
I don't care if like we have computers that will solve that for you,

1723
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:32,300
after, you know, that, right?

1724
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,900
So me wasting your and my time on a

1725
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,500
White board solving a cubic equation that's like a High School, AP

1726
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,800
Calculus class thing at best, right?

1727
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,200
I mean, if for some reason you couldn't do that, we could teach you to

1728
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,100
do that on the job.

1729
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,100
I that's like wrote skills, right?

1730
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,100
So yeah, yeah, it's just doesn't matter.

1731
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:53,500
It's not the thing that's going to determine whether you're going to

1732
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,600
be an asset to a team.

1733
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:59,300
And so I feel like interviews that focus on you doing a rope process,

1734
01:14:59,300 --> 01:14:59,800
that we know,

1735
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,000
How to do.

1736
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And that computers can do just doesn't make sense.

1737
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,700
Hearing you understand how a hermite spline comes about?

1738
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,600
That's crucial, if you were just like, I don't know, here's the

1739
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,900
formula and you just wrote the formula up, then I would have pushed to

1740
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,400
go.

1741
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:13,800
Okay?

1742
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,200
How did you get that right?

1743
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:18,000
But you told me, you had already told me about the time, you wrote it

1744
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,400
out.

1745
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,200
You'd already told me how to generate it, which is exactly what I

1746
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,300
wanted to hear, right?

1747
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,700
Like you told me exactly what I wanted to hear before.

1748
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:28,100
I didn't even have to ask a question, right?

1749
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:29,800
Okay, you see.

1750
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,600
What I'm saying?

1751
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,900
Yeah, there was another one where I was like, do you want me to

1752
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,800
explain this and you were like, no, what was that?

1753
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,500
Do you remember?

1754
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,600
Because there's something else that I was like, this is something that

1755
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,000
I think you'd want me to explain.

1756
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,900
I'm not sure sorry, I don't know because again, almost all of the

1757
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,700
questions that you often times, would go ahead and work out an

1758
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,100
equation on the board, which may because you thought I want to or

1759
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,100
whatever, but you'll notice, almost all the questions I asked.

1760
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:59,800
Were I just wanted an explanation and

1761
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:03,800
I wanted that explanation to be clear to me that you understood the

1762
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,200
reason.

1763
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,100
So, for example, you notice, I asked a bunch of times about Square

1764
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:08,400
Root versus non square root.

1765
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,200
Yeah.

1766
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:13,100
But which threw me off because it was like a not an issue at all.

1767
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,200
It was just like, oh, if you're only stepping, you don't need to waste

1768
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,400
your time with the square root, right?

1769
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:16,600
Right.

1770
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,500
It's like only thing.

1771
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,500
It was such a minor issue that you kept asking about.

1772
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,200
I was like, what is going on, but you can see why, right?

1773
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,600
It's because I wanted to make sure that I heard the answer like which

1774
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,800
is which is essentially oh okay.

1775
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,800
There is a

1776
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:35,000
Insha pin signed distance field between the iso value, right?

1777
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,800
The radius which you have therefore the thing and the equation on the

1778
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:45,600
other side because all I care about is that relationship right being

1779
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,400
equal to a particular value.

1780
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:51,800
It's free for me to square both sides of this thing and I don't have

1781
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:56,800
to worry but until I heard the square of the radius I couldn't be sure

1782
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,500
that you actually have thought it all the way through, right?

1783
01:16:59,500 --> 01:16:59,800
Right.

1784
01:16:59,800 --> 01:16:59,800
So

1785
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,500
When I when I answer that question I went through, like okay I drew

1786
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,300
the whole equation out and I put our and I was like, you take the, did

1787
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:07,100
I did you want that?

1788
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,900
Or we could you just be like a square, the radius.

1789
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,300
Like what do, what was it as acceptable answer for you?

1790
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,600
Well, again it's Nick and this is crucial.

1791
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,000
The, the whole point about this kind of interview style is it's not an

1792
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
answer, it's a me.

1793
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:25,200
Get making sure I've heard enough so that I know that it's 100% solid

1794
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,500
in your head, right?

1795
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,000
And like I said, in a lot of these cases because I already know you, I

1796
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,200
know it's already solid in your head but right.

1797
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,700
I potentially only know the answer, but in order to show the interview

1798
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,600
process properly, I tried as hard as I could to go assume

1799
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:45,500
Sean doesn't actually know or might not know and let me actually do

1800
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,900
what I need to do to demonstrate to myself that he does because that's

1801
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,300
the point of demonstrate the interview process.

1802
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:51,800
Right.

1803
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,400
Right right.

1804
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,300
And again we have to assume that you know someone coming in the door,

1805
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,600
doesn't necessarily know these things.

1806
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,700
A lot of people a lot of

1807
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,400
Hammers would fail to be able to really lucidly.

1808
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,500
Explain a lot of the stuff you just explained.

1809
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:07,900
That's just true, right?

1810
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,200
You know, we take it for granted because a lot of times we're talking

1811
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,200
about very good programmers.

1812
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,200
When we talk about it, you know, like a lot of people mentioned on

1813
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,700
these streams, you know, you or Sean or Fabi under John Blow of course

1814
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,200
they know this stuff and of course they can explain it.

1815
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,600
That's not the common case, right?

1816
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,200
And when you're interviewing for these things, you know, and you're

1817
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,900
looking to see if someone's really technically competent, it's

1818
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,700
Not at all a given that someone's going to be able to explain those

1819
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:33,700
things in that way.

1820
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,500
So I'm not looking for an answer, right?

1821
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,000
I'm not looking for you to say Square.

1822
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,700
The radius I'm looking for you to say enough stuff so that I can see

1823
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,600
that in your brain.

1824
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,200
It's all worked out the right way and that sometimes may be as simple

1825
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,600
as a few quick sentences.

1826
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm like okay, he obviously has it other times, for whatever reason,

1827
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,500
maybe I haven't quite heard enough yet and I just want to be sure and

1828
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,700
then that's where I need to drill down.

1829
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:57,200
So it's that's all it is.

1830
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,700
And there isn't like none of the things I asked you had.

1831
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,600
Correct answers to me at all.

1832
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:05,300
They were just let me see how this person thinks about the problem.

1833
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,700
And once I see that it's fully formed, I can I'm satisfied, right?

1834
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:10,400
Does that make sense?

1835
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,700
Oh yeah, yeah I think I think if I ever had a job interview that would

1836
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,300
be this would be fine.

1837
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:17,600
Yeah.

1838
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,900
And hopefully, like I said, barring the fact that a lot of things were

1839
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,200
weird for you because you didn't understand why, I didn't understand

1840
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:24,800
them or why.

1841
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,000
I was asking you something that you knew that I already knew you put

1842
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,500
doubt in my head.

1843
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,300
I was like, am I explaining this like an idiot?

1844
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,800
No, and so I apologize for that part, but that again, hopefully

1845
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,300
wouldn't be a problem in a normal interview process because you

1846
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,800
wouldn't know the other person was an expert on 3D or something,

1847
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,100
right.

1848
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:41,400
Weight.

1849
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,800
And that actually, that would be, that would actually be a difficult

1850
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,800
thing is like, if I don't know who's interviewing me, is it like an HR

1851
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,100
person?

1852
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,700
Because if it's an HR person like, oh my God, what am I doing?

1853
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,300
Well, they're not going to know how to do to be able to do that you in

1854
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,300
that way, they're not going to know how to interrogate those.

1855
01:19:56,300 --> 01:20:00,900
Those kind of technical problems is an HR person would be lost because

1856
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,100
you notice my questions to you were always based on things.

1857
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,400
You had just told me if you can't follow a technical discussion.

1858
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,700
There's no way to conduct an interview, so it has to be a programmer

1859
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,500
and, as to be a programmer, who's relatively good?

1860
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,200
Ideally, the programmer does know all these things, but maybe they

1861
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,300
don't know them.

1862
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,900
You know, maybe they don't really know that much about signed distance

1863
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:25,900
field again, that's okay because what you're trying to do as you do

1864
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:29,500
assume that the interviewer is a smart technical person just because

1865
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,500
they don't know science field that's all the more reason that that's a

1866
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,400
good way to go about this interview because if you can't explain it to

1867
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,000
me if I'm a relatively smart programmer and you can't explain it to

1868
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,200
me, that's a problem, right?

1869
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,700
Because if you understand really understand the material, you should

1870
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,400
be able to explain it to me slowly easily.

1871
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,200
Li as long as I'm not asking too big, right?

1872
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,100
And so you know either way I think it works.

1873
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,800
If the person doing the interviewing doesn't know that discipline but

1874
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,800
is a relative smart person, that's okay because Dennis

1875
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,100
It's literally, like, you're just my teacher, I'm just treating you as

1876
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:07,800
my teacher for 30 minutes and seeing how much I feel like I really got

1877
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,500
the understanding, the material, the end of it.

1878
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,700
And that to me is a really good style for the interview.

1879
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,500
Much better than programming puzzle.

1880
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:16,400
Yeah.

1881
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:16,900
Program puzzle.

1882
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,500
Doesn't sound good?

1883
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,000
This seems this seemed reasonable.

1884
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:23,600
Like if I ever applied for a job which know and these days right.

1885
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,600
It's not so relevant.

1886
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,100
But yeah.

1887
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,600
Yeah no, I just don't want.

1888
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah.

1889
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,900
But like if that ever happened and like I had to interview,

1890
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,400
You like this?

1891
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,500
I'd be like, all right this is somewhere where they at least are

1892
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:33,900
trying.

1893
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:34,800
Maybe I'd want to work here.

1894
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
Like this is much better than then.

1895
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,900
Like what was the one that got invert?

1896
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:43,000
This tree invert like an AVL tree or something like that on a

1897
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,600
whiteboard?

1898
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,100
It's just like I'm just know my answer to that.

1899
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,900
Question is no I heard it either.

1900
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,900
Another programmer interview was design, a lock for EQ on a whiteboard

1901
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,700
know, right?

1902
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,400
All of those things are to me.

1903
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,400
They tell you a lot about

1904
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:04,600
What the sort of criteria is for working at that company and it, you

1905
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,500
know, it would make me nervous about the kind of people that I might

1906
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,500
be working with at that point.

1907
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,200
Because if I know that the general criteria for becoming a part of

1908
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,600
this company is there people who have to perform relatively well under

1909
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:21,600
pressure like that that to me is not the criteria the filtering

1910
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,400
criteria that I really want right II.

1911
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,700
Don't really know who I'm going to be working with.

1912
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,600
At that point I don't have confidence that the

1913
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,300
I'm that I'm going to be working with has been screened in a way that

1914
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,700
actually produces high quality people on the other side.

1915
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:41,200
It's screening for something totally unrelated to that that, you know,

1916
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,500
I don't know if it's going to be a good programming team.

1917
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,200
You know, I have no idea at that point.

1918
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:48,200
And furthermore, one of the things about this interview process, this

1919
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,900
nice to is it means that in general, you're going to select for people

1920
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:55,100
who can explain things to their co-workers.

1921
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,600
Who don't get frustrated with people who don't understand stuff,

1922
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,800
because they've had to go through an interview.

1923
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
You process where basically, they were the expert and they were

1924
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,100
telling someone something about what they did and that's a valuable

1925
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,400
skill day-to-day, right?

1926
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,100
I never thought about.

1927
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,400
I never thought about it from that perspective and yeah, that's like

1928
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,100
that's like the most important thing.

1929
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:17,000
A programming puzzle is not a skill, you will ever use.

1930
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,400
Again, that's not something you're going to ever do again.

1931
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,900
In that way, right?

1932
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,100
You're never going to be presented with a isolated high pressure,

1933
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,600
time-limited thing.

1934
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,300
What you are going to have to do?

1935
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,800
Oftentimes is someone pops

1936
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,400
Your office.

1937
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,100
I don't understand the anti Alias or and I got to fix this bug.

1938
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,100
Can you just tell me a little bit about how it works?

1939
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,100
Oh, yeah.

1940
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:36,800
You sure.

1941
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,800
Casey here's like, you draw the thing up here, in up.

1942
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,100
Like you said, I don't really remember how we did the to sign just as

1943
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:42,500
feel thing.

1944
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,400
But was Christopher eriksson's, you can go look on the web.

1945
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,700
What you gave me was exactly what I needed to know, to go fix the anti

1946
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,000
Alias or something was broken.

1947
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,200
That's a real situation that will come update a day.

1948
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,200
So right?

1949
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,300
Also in addition to, I think it being a good interview process, it

1950
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,000
also actually does

1951
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,600
Are resemblance to something you will do day to day, which I think is

1952
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:04,200
important.

1953
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,000
You know, that's what the interview should be built around.

1954
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,300
Not something you won't do, right?

1955
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,100
Yeah, that's it.

1956
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,800
This is definitely much better than yes.

1957
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,500
We're going to be thanks Checker.

1958
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,500
Thank you, Chris.

1959
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,400
Thank you for for and I don't know, maybe he didn't come up with it.

1960
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,500
All I know is I learned it from him.

1961
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:23,300
So you'll have to tell, I don't maybe someday you can stream and say

1962
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,200
how it came about, because I actually have no idea where it comes from

1963
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,800
or why, why it comes from, but,

1964
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,400
That's it.

1965
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,500
So I guess we can probably wrap it up and you can give your voice some

1966
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,000
much-needed.

1967
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,800
Rest, thank you so much for for interviewing doing the mock interview.

1968
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,600
Hopefully yes.

1969
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,900
Thanks for explaining all the scientists feel stuff.

1970
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,300
Everyone on the stream probably now knows well but everyone watching

1971
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:50,600
don't do this.

1972
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:55,600
Don't do this too but like it's important to know that the the vertex

1973
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,300
winding thing I guess but like don't do this to figure out the

1974
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,800
distance to a line segment go.

1975
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,600
Get rid of.

1976
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:04,600
That was one tiny little part that all the government was was, you

1977
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,100
know, signed distance feels 101 education course which is useful to

1978
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,500
people.

1979
01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:11,900
Go get, go get real-time Collision detection.

1980
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:13,000
It'll answer all your questions.

1981
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,400
All right, maybe I'll have to order a copy.

1982
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,400
You don't have it.

1983
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,700
I don't know you probably well, and it's just basically, I have it for

1984
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,300
all the distance functions, it's just like, yeah, but here they are.

1985
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,900
Yeah, here they are, he's like, okay great.

1986
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,600
I have them now.

1987
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,800
I never have to think about it.

1988
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,400
Yeah.

1989
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,300
All right, well thanks so much John I will I will hang up the Hang Ups

1990
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:36,800
now.

1991
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,700
Okay, are you streaming today?

1992
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,900
Are you streaming when you stream in?

1993
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,900
Next I was going to say I you know, probably in half an hour, I guess

1994
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,300
I will.

1995
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,200
All right, well, there you go.

1996
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,700
So if you if you want more Sean will be streamed in half an hour.

1997
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:48,100
You're not.

1998
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,200
You're doing him in here, are you?

1999
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:49,700
No, no.

2000
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:50,600
That's it for today.

2001
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,100
Okay.

2002
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,400
What's your Twitch handle SSS McGrath?

2003
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,300
It's SSS.

2004
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:56,500
McGrath, yeah.

2005
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,200
I always have to check the number of s's

2006
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,900
Because sometimes I trust asses until it wasn't taken.

2007
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,600
How come you don't do McGrath?

2008
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,100
How come it would send that?

2009
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,500
Do not all right?

2010
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:09,400
No, I don't remember.

2011
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,300
All right, all right, thanks so much John and thank you.

2012
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:12,800
That was great.

2013
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:13,600
Take it easy, man.

2014
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,500
Okay.

2015
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,100
Well, so if you if you want here we can takes a few quick questions if

2016
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,800
there's any questions from people watching on the stream.

2017
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:35,000
I don't know if that was a reasonable enough, sort of illustration of

2018
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:35,600
the process.

2019
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,400
I hope that it was that went what I thought very well.

2020
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,200
That's exactly how you would like a good interview to go.

2021
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,100
I think it for me, if I was actually interviewing Sean I feel like I

2022
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:46,900
would have had all the information.

2023
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:53,200
I needed but I, you know, I don't actually know.

2024
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,000
What would have happened?

2025
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,400
You know, he knows all that stuff and very good explaining it.

2026
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:04,000
It might have been sort of thing where it would be interesting to, to

2027
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,800
see what happens on someone who doesn't really know stuff.

2028
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,400
But I don't want to put anyone in that position on the stream, so we

2029
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:14,000
can't I don't feel comfortable demonstrating the no higher, right?

2030
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Sean's kind of an example of this is someone interviewing who you are

2031
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
going to hire, right?

2032
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:25,400
And so you know, demonstrating the, the obvious part of sorry, the

2033
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:28,500
Counterpoint to that which is what it looks like.

2034
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,900
When someone doesn't do well in the interview,

2035
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,200
You and probably, you know, this is something you shouldn't hire.

2036
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:36,400
I don't really feel like demonstrating that is is okay because I don't

2037
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,500
want someone to look bad on stream, right?

2038
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:43,800
And so, you'll just have to take my word for the fact that when

2039
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:48,100
someone doesn't have a really tight grasp on the material, as you

2040
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:53,400
drill down into it, like we did their answers will fall apart and they

2041
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,800
can't really explain anything to you and they don't really know what's

2042
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,500
going on and that's typically what happens.

2043
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:06,700
So you know, yeah, like I said I don't feel comfortable demonstrating

2044
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:10,100
that but you can sort of take my word for it.

2045
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,400
That it does it does work.

2046
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:16,000
Or you can try yourself and see how your how are your mileage is on

2047
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,100
it, okay.

2048
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:21,000
Sergio says, I believe I'm good at these kinds of interviews, but

2049
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,500
often my main problem is just getting my foot in the door.

2050
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,800
What advice could you give to make it more likely for me to actually

2051
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,400
an interview?

2052
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:28,900
So I think

2053
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:35,400
The thing that I wanted to say there and oh, my my goodness, my head

2054
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:36,400
is actually missing.

2055
01:28:36,700 --> 01:28:37,500
I don't know why.

2056
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,500
I don't know why my head is missing from the stream.

2057
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,300
That's interesting.

2058
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,900
The webcam is supposedly there.

2059
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:48,600
Right there is webcam, but you know,

2060
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,500
I'm not visible.

2061
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,400
I don't know why.

2062
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,600
well, there's that

2063
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:10,300
You know what?

2064
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:11,300
I'm not going to try and fix that.

2065
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,300
I'm just going to be a disembodied voice for the moment because I

2066
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:14,700
don't know.

2067
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:19,900
It looks like honestly, it looks like my my webcam is not even on.

2068
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,700
Which doesn't really make any sense.

2069
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:27,300
I wonder if because we were just seeing it on the Hangouts, so I

2070
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,700
wonder if like, it got shut off for some reason.

2071
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:41,900
Yeah, I don't know what happened there.

2072
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,900
That's a that's a very good question.

2073
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:47,900
Hold on one second.

2074
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,600
I'll see if there's anything that can be done about that.

2075
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,600
I apologize for that.

2076
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:58,400
But, you know, that's, that's just some reliable Computing going on

2077
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:58,700
there.

2078
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:12,700
It may have been caused to Applications were trying to access the

2079
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,100
webcam for all I know.

2080
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:20,200
And I'm not sure if that's like kind of thing that they can not really

2081
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:20,600
handle.

2082
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,800
Particularly well, I wish there was some way to reinitialize, the

2083
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:29,400
webcam, but I don't actually see any particular way of making that

2084
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,000
happen, right?

2085
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:37,200
Like, I kind of need to tell OBS like, hey man, can you go ahead and

2086
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,700
Andre sort

2087
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,800
Initialize yourself and I don't think it's going to want to do that.

2088
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:45,100
Without I could probably like shut it off and turn it back on again,

2089
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:49,700
but then the stream would have to go down which is less useful.

2090
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,100
So, I don't really know any other way of getting this.

2091
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,900
This sausage gentlemen, here to do that.

2092
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,100
So you'll have to deal with the disembodied head for our disembodied

2093
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:00,800
voice rather.

2094
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,900
So what?

2095
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:09,300
Let me go ahead and and sort of answer these questions a little bit.

2096
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,500
Let's see here.

2097
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:17,700
So Sergio, I wanted to answer your question of any advice you can give

2098
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,300
to make it more likely to get interview.

2099
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,200
So I just want to make clear this stream is strictly for interviewers,

2100
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:23,800
right?

2101
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,500
This dream was just a sort of demonstrate.

2102
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
Hey, if you're interviewing in Tech,

2103
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,000
here's another way to interview that I think is a lot better than the

2104
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
high-pressure program puzzle.

2105
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,300
Kind of wave interviewing, maybe consider doing it because a, I think

2106
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:42,100
you get better hires out of it and be I think that it takes some of

2107
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:46,600
the adversarial nature and the unpleasantness out of the interview

2108
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:51,700
process that currently is going on at a lot of tech companies.

2109
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:52,600
And so that was it.

2110
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,700
I have no advice for interviewees.

2111
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:55,900
I have none.

2112
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't know anything about that.

2113
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,000
Process.

2114
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:04,700
I do not know anything about how to increase your chances of getting

2115
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:09,100
an interview or how to pass HR screens or any of that stuff.

2116
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,400
So I have no advice to give their.

2117
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:17,700
I'm I was just trying to illustrate for the other side.

2118
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,800
Hey, here's here's how it goes, right.

2119
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:37,800
Midler says, Sean was great obviously, but I think that interviewees

2120
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:42,400
could also maybe do with having a bit of a plan as to which rat-holes

2121
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,000
they'd be prepared to go down.

2122
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,000
So to a certain degree.

2123
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,400
Yes.

2124
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:53,600
And to a certain degree, no one of the goals of this interview process

2125
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,700
and I knew that it would be relatively easy on Sean, because he was

2126
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,800
not familiar with the interview process.

2127
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,200
Begin with one of the goals is to push the person into the area that

2128
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,400
you have picked and not really let them dictate the area too much,

2129
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,900
because yes, they may have started like rehearsing for programming.

2130
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:16,800
And who's in that way you want to try as much as possible to keep them

2131
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,700
explaining things that maybe they weren't necessarily expecting to

2132
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,700
explain ahead of time in so much as you can.

2133
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,300
So, you know, take that for whatever it's worth.

2134
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:27,800
But

2135
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,100
Mr.

2136
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,400
First Dimension, I am curious how you would move forward with the

2137
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,200
interview if someone doesn't have a lot of interesting past projects

2138
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,700
that they are excited to talk about.

2139
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,400
Does this just assume you're hiring experienced people?

2140
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:46,100
Well, it depends what you mean by that.

2141
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,900
So, no, it doesn't.

2142
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,900
It doesn't assume.

2143
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:51,100
You're hiring experienced people in the industry.

2144
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:54,100
It does assume that you're hiring people with programming experience,

2145
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:54,600
right?

2146
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,000
If you are hiring, literally for people who don't know how to program

2147
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,700
than, yeah, right.

2148
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,700
It's not for that but I don't know anybody in the industry who hires

2149
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:08,000
people who don't know how to program.

2150
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,300
Maybe there are some who have like boot camps and stuff that try to

2151
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,500
just take smart people and train them be programmers.

2152
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:16,300
But assuming that you're talking about someone knows how to program.

2153
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,600
You just don't know how to program in C.

2154
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:23,300
If you haven't programmed for many many, many, many hours, right?

2155
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:26,500
That's just a fact, right?

2156
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,500
So if this person is going to be at all qualified for the job in any

2157
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:31,600
way,

2158
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,500
They have at least done a bunch of programming in school or in their

2159
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,600
spare time or something because otherwise, they just don't not a

2160
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,300
program yet in which case you definitely don't want them, right?

2161
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,600
So they don't have to have done any past projects on the scale of what

2162
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,400
Sean has done.

2163
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:48,400
For example, whole games, but they must have done something.

2164
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,200
They must have done, you know, if this person hasn't done 5,000 hours

2165
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,300
of C programming or something, right?

2166
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,000
Then I don't know why I would be interviewing them at all even for an

2167
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,900
entry level position.

2168
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,700
They're just not going to be good enough at Sea to really be part of a

2169
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:04,500
team, right?

2170
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,500
So you'd you know, under that limit where you don't have anything in

2171
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,200
their past, that you can talk about that person is really not a

2172
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,300
programmer yet in my mind, right?

2173
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:18,700
So Sean obviously makes it look maybe a little more grandiose because

2174
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:21,600
we're talking about entire projects in tired games.

2175
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,800
He shipped and we're drilling down on those, but that thing that you

2176
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,100
start drilling down, it could be anything.

2177
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,300
You can be a school project, a particular class that they took that

2178
01:35:29,300 --> 01:35:31,200
they liked and what about it?

2179
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,900
They liked and to explain things that they learned in it, right?

2180
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,600
So you don't have to have the kind of breath that Sean was presenting.

2181
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,700
You just have to have enough hours to actually be a competent

2182
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:43,200
programmer.

2183
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,700
But if that's happened, there's going to be stuff you can drill down

2184
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:49,100
on and so that's really all you need there.

2185
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,900
I think I got all the questions.

2186
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,200
Do you think streaming yourself online?

2187
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,200
Maybe is even helpful for interviews like you do.

2188
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,000
um,

2189
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:22,900
Possibly.

2190
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:30,500
I mean, one thing that I would say is on the interviewee side.

2191
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,900
If even taking that out of the think, it's like I said, I don't have a

2192
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:39,600
lot of advice for interviewees, but one thing I would say is part of

2193
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:44,200
being a good programmer on a team, if you're just programming by

2194
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:47,900
yourself all the time, then this not so necessary, but part of being a

2195
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,800
good parent of Team, like we were sort of saying at the end of the

2196
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,500
interview, there is being able to explain what you've done to other

2197
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,300
people in a way that they can understand.

2198
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,400
Right?

2199
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And so doing streams, where you explain programming stuff or just

2200
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,700
proving

2201
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,500
Just explaining things is just a generally, good programmer skill to

2202
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,300
have in general and the fact that it would help with an interview like

2203
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:16,000
this one is just kind of a bonus on top of the fact that it's just a

2204
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,100
good thing to know how to do.

2205
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:21,600
So it is I think true that that is the sort of thing that you know you

2206
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,800
might want to.

2207
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,400
Practice.

2208
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,100
And if streaming is a good way for you to practice it then that would

2209
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:28,600
be good.

2210
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:28,900
Yeah.

2211
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:02,800
Looks like we've got everything I think.

2212
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:17,200
All right.

2213
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:23,800
All right.

2214
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,800
Thank you everyone for joining me for this special edition of handmade

2215
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:35,200
hero where we went over how like, how to do it Tech interviews that

2216
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,600
are non-confrontational, or at least as non-confrontational as

2217
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:38,200
possible.

2218
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,300
Hopefully, that's something that some people out there might consider

2219
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,600
doing instead of sort of the programming puzzle high-pressure version

2220
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:50,700
of interviews, which I think are really biased towards hiring

2221
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:55,300
specific, sorts of people that don't necessarily correlate at any

2222
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:55,500
particular.

2223
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,700
ocular way to people who will be good programmers for

2224
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,400
Team.

2225
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:04,300
So that's just, you know, an example of how to do it.

2226
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:05,900
I tried to do it as best I could.

2227
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,100
Again that's not my invention.

2228
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:13,500
I learned it from Chris Hecker and he may watch the stream and feel

2229
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,700
like I did a poor job of it in which case.

2230
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,600
Yeah I do hope that if he has any interest he would demonstrate it

2231
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:25,300
some time where he could kind of show maybe things that I did wrong.

2232
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:29,500
Or if there's any, if there's any, like kind of finer points to it,

2233
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:34,600
that I kind of missed the boat on I, like I said, I only really know

2234
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:39,800
how to do it because I watched him do it and he was very good at it.

2235
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,800
So hopefully that gives sort of, you know, puts another idea out

2236
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,100
there, a little more broadly, in terms of how interviews can be

2237
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:51,600
conducted in ways that do get down to really technical nitty-gritty,

2238
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,200
and do force people to really demonstrate their understanding of how

2239
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,300
things work at a deep level.

2240
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:02,400
Which does not require this sort of on the spot programming puzzle.

2241
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:08,400
Sort of, I guess confrontational situation that I think can cause a

2242
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:11,100
lot of programmers, who are otherwise very good at programming, but

2243
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,500
just not particularly good at that.

2244
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:20,000
One situation to kind of fall down and perhaps, not get hired at a job

2245
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,500
where they would actually be very good for that job.

2246
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:23,500
So that's it.

2247
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,800
Thank you very much for joining me tomorrow.

2248
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,100
This, this whole weekend is basically special programming on handmade

2249
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:29,300
hero.

2250
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:30,400
That's just the way it worked out.

2251
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:34,600
In terms of scheduling tomorrow, I had been meaning for quite some

2252
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:38,100
time to try to get Charles Bloom to come and talk to us.

2253
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,400
He could not make handmade Khan.

2254
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,600
He was supposed to be on the panel for compression but he could not

2255
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:45,200
make it.

2256
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,800
And so he agreed to come talk to us separately.

2257
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,400
And so tomorrow, we're going to be talking with Charles Bloom about

2258
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,900
compression, which should be fantastic because he, he and Fabien

2259
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,300
obviously,

2260
01:40:57,300 --> 01:41:01,400
Some very pioneering work in compression just recently, and it's

2261
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,200
pretty exciting stuff.

2262
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:06,600
So getting kind of like his outlook on compression how he thinks about

2263
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,300
I think it's going to be really interesting so I'm very excited for

2264
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:08,800
that.

2265
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,800
I don't know exactly what time that will be tomorrow because we're

2266
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,200
going to do it sort of in person, so you kind of play it by ear but of

2267
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,400
course it will be uploaded to YouTube afterwards.

2268
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,900
So if you can't make the stream live since we don't really necessarily

2269
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,600
know exactly what time.

2270
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,700
I can't tell you definitively, what time to be here for that.

2271
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:25,400
You will be able to catch it on YouTube, so hopefully that should be

2272
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,200
good.

2273
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,300
Good and everyone can go from there.

2274
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:30,500
That's about it.

2275
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,900
Thanks for joining and we'll see, everyone tomorrow.

2276
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:36,600
Until then have fun programming and see everyone on the internet.

2277
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,400
Take it easy, everybody.
